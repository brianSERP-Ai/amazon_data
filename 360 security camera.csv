Also, remote access so that my sweet parents can also watch her when they can’t be around her (hence this quarantine)!The price!!!!! Well worth it and reasonable! The last monitor I had was over $100 and it died just short of its warranty and could not be sent back. Very very VERY pleased with this product.This product also is easy to mount! No weird angle that you need to attach to the wall then screw in the cams!! NOPE attach then click in the cam! Wonderful!","I have the Nooie 1080P indoor camera and I've been quite happy with it so I had to give this 360-degree model a try. It takes the features of the static camera and adds the ability to pan and tilt the camera either manually or you can enable motion tracking easily through the app. I wrote a review for the static camera and many of the features carry over including its great video quality so if you've read that review, some of this will seem familiar.Setup -Setup was very simple using your phone or tablet, running the free Nooie Cam app. You first need to verify that your phone is connected to the 2.4Ghz access point in your home where you will be using the camera. You then simply start the Nooie Cam app and select the +Camera button. You select the Nooie Cam 360 option and it will walk you through the remaining, simple steps. Basically, you assure the camera is on, enter the password for the wireless access point/router your phone is currently connected to (this is the same one you will be connecting the camera to), click Next, and a QR code appears on the screen of your phone. You now hold the screen of your phone in front of the Nooie camera's lens and it provides an audible tone and LED light indicator when it is finished reading the QR code. The app will now inform you that it is pairing and will begin a countdown. When complete, the app will inform you that pairing has completed. It's that simple.Use -Now that the camera has been added, you simply select it to view the camera. To hear audio from the camera, you select the speaker icon within the app and now you are able to see and hear what's going on around the camera. The camera also has a built-in speaker that allows you to press the microphone button within the app and then speak through it. This is very useful and/or just fun depending on where you locate the camera. For example, I have the camera in my living room where my cat typically spends a good part of her day. If you have cats, I'm guessing yours is similar where she doesn't have one place that she always lays within a room. She instead has multiple locations that she'll randomly select. With this 360 degree camera, either from home, from work, a restaurant, wherever I have WiFi or cellular access I can pan the camera from left to right and up or down. It's range is great where you can literally place the camera in the center of the room and, from the app, turn it from it's left side behind it all the way around front, through to the right side behind it just by swiping across the screen with the camera's image live the whole time. You can pan it around to see the entire room. Beyond this, you have the ability to tilt the camera up and down from the app as well by swiping up and down on the camera's image live. I can scan the room for my cat, locate her, and then touch the microphone to talk to her. Being a cat, she chooses whether she wants to respond or not. Sometimes her ears just perk up and she whines (which you can hear through the camera's built-in microphone), but other times she'll choose to walk over to the camera and give it some love. :)If you choose to use the Motion Tracking feature, if your cat, or anything really, moves in front of the camera's lens, the camera will follow it. As the moving option moves close to the edge of the camera's current visibility, the camera will move to center the moving object within it's vew and continue doing this until the moving object either stops moving or moves behind something where the camera can no longer see it. One thing to note with automatic Motion Tracking is the camera can pan 360 degrees. If something moves and the camera ends up pointing in a different direction than the next moving object. The next moving option must move in front of the lens at some point for the camera to see it and start tracking it. Depending on where you mount the camera and your use, this may be fine or it may not. So, definitely think about this before placing the camera if you plan to enable Motion Tracking.Video and audio can be recorded to either a microSD card or to the cloud. Cloud storage is a paid service. Given my usage, microSD recording is fine for me so I haven't tried the cloud storage option. MicroSD recordings are easily accessed through the app via a scrollable tape across the bottom of the screen. You select the day and then scroll through to the time you would like to view. If at any time you are viewing live video or recorded video from the app and you would like to save the video to your device, you simply press the camera icon on screen to set the start point, continue watching the video as it plays, and press the icon again when you'd like to stop and the video will be saved to your device. It's VERY easy!Like other security cameras, you can also setup notifications based on sound and/or motion. This too is easy to configure by selecting None, Low, Medium, or High for each option and then selecting the timeframe that you would like to receive notifications. Note that you can enable disable notifications by day, but each day only has one start time and one end time that can be selected. Meaning, you cannot setup notifications from 8am-5pm and then again 10pm to midnight for the same day. You could do one or the other, but not both. I don't see this as a problem for me, but it's worth noting depending on your use case.There are a few additional notable settings. First is the ability to enable/disable audio recording. I haven't done much testing with this, but I'd imagine this could save some space on your microSD card, allowing you to possibly record more video if disabled. Second is the ability to enable/disable the small LED light on the camera. If you placed the camera in a visible location in your home, you may want to disable the LED to avoid the distraction of it. Last, there is a Rotate Image option. So, if you need to mount the camera under an overhang, cabinet, etc., you can simple tap this button to flip the image for mounting the camera upside down and now viewing it live or recorded video will display right-side up.Customer Service -I reached out to Nooie's customer service prior to purchasing my previous camera as I had a number of questions. I received quick, thorough responses the same day, shortly after I had sent them. I worked with Julia who was great to work with. Very friendly, personable, and understanding. Julia's customer service was great and made the decision to purchase this camera a complete no-brainer. As I'm sure many of you know, when you have questions or something goes wrong you really find out what a company is made of. I'm happy to say Nooie's support is great! Regarding this camera, I had a few questions for Nooie support prior to purchasing it and received the same great, prompt responses. This proved even moreso that their support is great! It wasn't just a one time fluke with the first camera.Summary -This camera works great and has clear video. The two-way communication capability is an added bonus and could open up its use to more than just a security camera. It's ability to automatically track motion as well as it's ability to turn 360 degrees while automatically tracking motion and/or by manually swiping the screen coupled with it's low price point of under $40 makes this a great buy in my book! I am definitely glad that I added this camera to my home. It will work well keeping track of not only the cat, but I can see when my teenager comes and goes when I'm not home.",Especially like night vision quality! Using it as grannycam for dementia mother who can roam house at night.,Awesome camera and quality. I've bought 2 already and one of the non moving ones as well.

It took several tries to pair it with the Wi-Fi but every device I have ever added like this requires several attempts to pair. Customer service was excellent I used the chat to communicate with customer service. They were very patient and helpful. I had a problem with the wording they used to instruct you to create a password. The technician directed me and sent me a sample password to use to login and from there he checked back with me several times to make sure that the set up was complete and I had no more questions. I do not know what time zone they are in but the customer service rep that I was chatting with was up with me until almost midnight. If you buy as many gadgets as I buy that need technical support I can tell you that the customer support is most definitely excellent. I purchased this camera because I bought a beach house in Mexico and it is made out of concrete.

These guys make great cams, and they have great customer support. I needed a cam for my back deck but I also needed a new porch light. This jewel solved both problems.The cam was easy to set up, just make sure you are on the 2.4 wifi. Simple to follow the instructions and you will be up and running in about 5 minutes. I use Ispy connect to monitor my cameras at home but I have the app on my phone when away.The camera is very customizable see photo 4 Using the HiCam app on your phone you can find the ip address of the camera ; go to settings>Device Info and the IP will be displayed. Type that IP into IE and you have access to lots of settings see photos. They have great customer support. I have NO, and I do mean ZERO complaints about any Hosafe cam I own. They have proven to be very reliable, I have had the outdoor cam for about 4 yrs + , the indoor ptz cam for about 3yrs and even though it has taken some abuse because of being in a chicken coop it works great. I highly recommend any Hosafe produce you may be interested in. Did I mention, they have great customer support.","This is one of several Hosafe cameras I have in use at my home and business. Hosafe customer service has always been excellent and quick to respond. That said, this latest and newest camera they are offering is a good value for the price.The many features are very appealing, but their execution needs some development. More on that later. First, when taken out of the well packed box I was surprised that the camera is very light and made of mostly plastic (assume the UV rays of South Florida don’t deteriorate the material as some plastics in the sun) and lighter weight to install. While the large dongle of wires (mostly the RJ 45 LAN connector) that usually are protruding out the bottom of the mounting base, this wire bundle exits out of the side of the base making wire management a bit more tricky if you want to hide them and protect their connection points. With the quicker set up on these newer cameras not requiring a hard wire to the router initially, I think the RJ 45 connector could be eliminated assuming you are only going to use the wifi connection which in reality is why you buy a “wifi” camera! That would eliminate the need to drill a ½ or larger hole to run those wires. As I have with the past 3 installations, I choose to mount my cameras on an outdoor plastic electrical box to terminate the wires and ease of attachment to the building. But this time instead of a large hole in the box cover under the base of the camera, I had to route the wire into the side of the box as shown in the photo. A bit tricky to keep it weather tight with a grommet.Now the features: The LED light source that comes on with motion is pretty bright and a welcome addition to illuminating the subject area and obtaining full color pictures at night. There is also an audible alarm but I am not using that for a good reason… the sensitivity of motion adjustment is adjustable but even at the lowest setting in the app, it is triggered with least bit of wind movement and even insects at night. So, the light is triggered often (that is ok with me) and that alarm would be a nuisance. The same problem comes into play with the other cool feature; motion tracking of the pan and tilt mechanism. Great feature and as stated, not real quick for fast moving objects but with the ultra-sensitive motion detection, it moves much too frequently. Also the range is pretty limited so as the subject moves out of the range (about 10 meters) the camera returns “home” and the subject is now out of the picture. Again, a great feature, but a bit of a delay upon motion ending and much broader sensitivity setting would be big improvement on these new features.Overall, the image is very clear and adequate resolution. Night vision (without the LED light on) is very good as expected. Wifi with the dual antenna is about average for me. I am only getting 60% on an outside, side wall about 15 meters line of site (through the house). My other cameras on the front side which are about half the distance are 100% signal strength with only 1 antenna. Your results may be better as there are many variables controlling wifi strength from inside to outside.The other great feature and the main selling point for me is you not only can use an SD card for image and video capture, but it is also ONVIF compatible to use the many camera security monitoring programs like Blue Iris and others. I am still experimenting with camera control on Blue Iris as it is registering with “generic” camera and all the features do not seem to be accessible so far.Lastly, the two-way audio works well and is another great feature for an inexpensive camera like this. I would buy it again.","This camera is quite impressive for its price. This is my first IP camera I have bought since 2008 and wow. The technology has sure quickly advanced.This camera has HD video and Audio. It does look very nice. The camera set up was so easy! I got confused at first, but then I read the instructional book and it put me back on track. Wifi set up was a breeze. Don’t forget to buy a microSD card for it, so you can record and store video. The auto tracking is impressive, the PTZ function is so fluid.Overall, very impressed. You will be too.Thanks HoSafe!","I've been hunting around for a decent, inexpensive outdoor PTZ camera. Other models I'd tried claimed to have ONVIF compatibility but never did. So far, this camera exceeds the requirements I put in place with only some minor caveats.First off, the design. The shell is made of plastic and is generally very light. While I'd prefer a metal case, the light weight of the case should make it easier to mount. The connections are all on a pigtail coming out the right side of the base. I'd prefer for them to be say receesed in the base or something, but nothing we can't work around! Other than that, the design is what you'd expect from a dome camera.Next, configuration. Power comes from a 12v 1A transformer with a 5.5mm jack. The cord provided is very short but it's a common size and will be easy to replace with something longer. Plugging it up and connecting it to my network brings me to my next point I highly recommend this camera. Unlike others that require some APP to configure the camera, this one just works. It's assigned an IP address and then you can log right into it and begin configuring it as needed. While an APP is available for both Apple and Android, just log into the camera! Through the web config, it only takes a few minutes to enable WIFI and connect it to your network. I want to mention how this camera is truly ONVIF compatible. Some other cameras claim this but aren't. In the case of this camera, it's instantly picked up using ONVIF Device Manager and can be configured this way. Massive thumbs up from me!Image quality is good and about what I expected from the camera. During the day, it's a little over saturated and too sharp. Tweaking tweaking the settings slightly improved the image greatly. Though what really sets this camera apart from similar models is the inclusion of flood lights. I've included a quick comparison of no lights, flood lights and then standard IR lights. Both uses of lights provide good images in the dark. Flood lights give you color at a shorter range with IR being black and white but showing more detail further out.The PTZ control is very good too. My other indoor PTZ cameras have always been very choppy and nearly impossible to make minor changes. This camera on the other hand is much smoother and allows for very minor bumps in adjustment. It also will remember it's last location if power is lost! Something none of my other PTZ cameras seem to do (without additional settings).All in all, I'm happy with this camera. I think my only real complaint is the how short the power cable is. But given the going price for this camera, you can add an extension still keep the price around if not lower than some similar cameras.","We bought two of these to install one by our front door and one over the garage door. I liked the quality so much,I bought a third to use in our back yard. Great for a security camera, but I'm thinking this might captured images of all the birds that visit. Already plugged in and working. For those buying this item, the included manual is a bit small to read easily, but it does explain installation. The app ""Camhipro"" is necessary for install, and I can control all three from one device. I used an old smart phone for the cameras so I left the app off my active phone! That way one has complete control, access to all the images, mic and speaker work fine, but does not interfere with voice or text communication.

Good night vision,"This IMOU camera has very good coverage with pan-tilt control in the smartphone. I cannot hear any noise when doing the pan-tilt movement. One surprise is that this camera has one privacy cover that can be controlled via smartphone. Another advantage is the super low video latency (almost less than 1/4 second). The sound latency is normal around 1s.I always want to have one camera with pan-tilt control that can cover the whole room without using multiple cameras. I purchased one Samsung SMARTCAM A1 (only can pan the camera up to 350° not tilt) before, however, the software is very hard to use and cost me more than $200. I also checked other famous brands like Ring and Arlo, but they just do not have any camera that supports pan-tilt control. Mi has one pan-tilt control camera, but I have some problems with the night vision of other Mi cameras. There is a clear ""click"" sound when the night vision is switched on. When the room has some light and not full dark, the camera's night vision will switch on and off frequently and causing lots of ""click"" sound. So far, I did not notice the ""click"" sound problem in this IMOU camera. I did experience one connection error in the initial setup, but I retried again and it works smoothly. I think the initial connection problem is caused by the permission issues in the iPhone. The IMOU camera can automatically connect to the device's wifi without letting you go to the Setting and manually switch wifi. This feature requires the permission in iOS to allow the device to access the local network, after I accepted this permission, the connection is very smooth.","What a value for the money. Delivers on everything it advertises and more. The picture quality for both day and night settings is great. The app is packed with features and easy to use. I will be ordering more.I had settled on this/these camera rather than a full ip camera (NVR) system due to the major price difference. I was willing to sacrifice the ip streaming and local recording in order for ease of setup and to save a few bucks. I was poking around in the settings and come to realize this camera supports RTSP (realtime streaming protocol) which allows setup with most security camera software. I am impressed by this capability in such an affordable camera.My only gripe (and it is a small one) is that the motors that move the camera were virtually silent when I received the cameras, however now that I have had them mounted (inverted/upsidedown) for several days, you can hear every time the camera tracks motion. I am not sure if this is a result of me mounting the cameras upside-down or not, however I assumed this was alright to do since the settings give you the option to invert the output stream. Clearly this was not big enough of a deal for me to take away a star on the rating.","I love this camera. I got it because I have a lot of house deliveries and they come inside the house. Where I have the camera it catches the front door, back door, and my windows. I can see everything on my phone. It even accommodates my two cats.","Set up was a bit dicey but once I figured it out, what a great camera. I can share with my family and even talk to them. Exceeds what I wanted from this device. Excellent choice!",I like it but I'm just no happy that I have to use another app to open it.

Starting with a rugged, dependable build and ending with cutting edge electronics, the Amcrest Amcrest 4MP Outdoor PTZ POE + IP Camera offers a range of features most other cameras don’t. Below are a list of pros and cons, followed by some suggestions for potential improvement.Cons:No speaker for talkback includedNo microphone included for the listen function (there is wiring in place to connect external speaker and microphone, but such accessory is not included and would have to be purchased separately; also a quick search on amcrest.com does not find such accessory, maybe a third party/).Camera switches to nighttime even as light appears to be sufficient and abundantHaving trouble focusing when zooming in, faces are out of focus, blurred and with apparent image ghostingLarge and heavyFisheye and privacy mode not availableAuto-Tracking not available in mobile appWhen on the mobile app, image ratio is either squeezed (portrait mode / vertical) or stretched (landscape mode / horizontal)Cloud app is laggy, with pan tilt relatively responsive but the image is significantly lagging behind with anywhere between 3 to 10 seconds delayExpensiveProsVery solid built, sturdy, all the components included, reliable hardware, screws and bolts, rubber washers - all to ensure a watertight installation (even gloves are included)Minimum lag on Amcrest View app (not the cloud app)Very responsive PTZGreat POE+ power function, No need for additional 24 V power or 110V power plug, just pull an ethernet cable connected to a POE+ switch, plug in the camera, scan the camera bar code with the app, and installation is done!Easy setup top with the existing appLocal storage and SSD card for up to 256GbGood iris control, good iris range - the iris opens very well allowing plenty of light.Potential improvements:Software:Improve software to coordinate zoom focus and Iris in a way that allows for better image clarity and less Image ghostingImprove mobile app (Amcrest Cloud) to display real size image (rather than stretched or squeezed)Hardware:  If possible reduce size and weight. On a large commercial property this may not be an issue, but on smaller residential buildings this camera may stand out.Include speaker/microphone for two way communication","Amcrest PTZ POE outdoor camera is build like a tank. Very well constructed with metal double enclosure (for protection from heat of the sun I suppose) and sturdy and thick aluminum mount. This surveillance camera is a serious business with 32x optical zoom and motorized dome. You can control pan with full turn 360° angle and 90° tilt. Camera can move quickly or slowly and is completely silent all the time. It uses a very good motor for sure. Picture quality is stunning and you can see every smallest detail on your property in Ultra HD resolution. To connect camera you will need just Ethernet cable connected to POE+ switch. You also need to download the App and get the camera to your network. You can watch and control video on a phone, iPad, computer or NAS.It can be connected to NVR as well which I actually did. I connected the camera to my existing surveillance system Hikvision NVR via ONVIF protocol and it started working immediately. Even PTZ control works well from my NVR. Amazing compatibility. It also has paid cloud storage support or you can just record video or events to onboard microSD card. Camera has a nice web UI with lots of settings. You can program camera movement as you wish, there are many features and functions here. Night vision works pretty good and camera focus works well enough.Highly recommend product if you have large property.","I've been waiting on Amcrest to step up their game and offer a new high-end ptz cam. Here it is. 32x optical zoom plus you can turn on 16x digital zoom. The latter is kinda buried in a menu but it IS there. This cam is like having a several thousand dollar Axis camera as one of my Blue Iris cams. Yes, it connected up to B.I. easily with no hassle. Great night and day vision. I have not dealt with the AI yet so I can't comment on that aspect. The zoom/ptz interaction works like a high end cam should. When you're zoomed way into something, the ptz is still easy to manage. You can add a 256gb card into it if you wish. Going to buy a 2nd one of these and retire an existing Amcrest 18x older ptz to some other duty. Oh, another thing: It's quiet. Even when you are next to it (and I was for several hours installing it), it's silent, even when doing a ptz move. This feature may be very useful for some of you. I've seen a lot of noisy ptz cams. This one is not. I have not turned on the defog option yet, so I'm unsure if that introduces any fan noises or not.","This is a very solidly built POE Camera.The installation of this camera was a breeze. I already had the Amcrest View Pro installed (for my other camera from Amcrest). So installing this camera as an additional device was very simple. The fact that it works using POE made my installation very easy as I didn't have a power connection near the garage where I have installed this camera. But, since I already had an ethernet wire running there, I was just able to connect it to the existing ethernet wire and connect the other end to the POE Converter that I had bought earlier.This is a security camera that I have installed outside my garage in a spot that is kind of hidden so that no one can see the camera.The camera supports 256GB of memory. This will allow me to store a lot of recordings without having to delete occasionally.The zoom of this video is great. I was able to pan/zoom to see every minute detail of the person's face who was standing like 20 ft from the camera.The Camera price seems to be high. But, for the quality of this camera it might be worth it. I will know if I can use this to monitor any security intrusion at my house like the one I had earlier, when someone tried to break into my car parked outside the garage. But, we were not able to find out who it was as the face was hardly clear in the night mode with my existing security camera.Any integration with Alexa or similar services would be helpful.It is also nice that the camera can be broadcast live using RTSP so that it can be shared with anyone.The application also allows sharing the camera with other family members. That's a big plus. When I am out of home or do not have internet connectivity, my wife can monitor itOverall, I would give this a 4.7 out of 5 rating.","This camera is hands-down the best built camera I’ve ever personally used or tested. The quality of the materials is second to none. The camera is heavy as you would expect it to be due to the high end components. The starlight sensor in it is incredibly accurate and detailed in low light. The night vision reach that I’m able to get with it is quite incredible. It’s easily almost twice the distance that most other more consumer oriented cameras have. The PTZ motors and components are whisper quiet and fast. There are no weak, shaky or dead spots in the camera travel. I can set it to a position I need with incredible ease. The 32x optical zoom is also pretty fantastic and leaves nothing to be desired. It will go super far. I didn’t find myself feeling the need to turn on the additional 16x digital zoom. I also love that it has two sub streams in addition to the main stream. That is incredibly helpful in more complicated blue iris setups. The AI seems to be working well also. This camera is incredibly smart and fast. It isn’t held back by buggy firmware. It reacts quickly and smoothly. This camera is a great “eye in the sky” type of camera. I can get tag numbers and critical details reliably due to the excellent specifications of this camera. The included mounting hardware and cables are all excellent quality and instructions are concise and clear on how to get it all mounted and hooked up with ease. The multiple options for powering the camera are nice as well. Another welcome addition is the trip wire hookup. That isn’t something you typically see on the smaller, cheaper cameras. My only request would be that the camera have a small speaker and microphone built in for situations in which hooking up an external mic and speaker aren’t feasible. However, amcrest has many other options for these use-cases as well. I’m incredibly happy with amcrest as a company and this camera is nothing short of amazing.",10,7,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-Outdoor-Motorized-Security-IP4M-1083EW-AI/dp/B08TYZ5XFC/ref=sr_1_22_sspa?keywords=360+security+camera&qid=1640229424&sr=8-22-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyUVk4RzNGNDEwS1NOJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzU5NjM1OUMyM05FRTM5SThCJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyODU2MzkyN0dCRjI3WjNINUVBJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYnRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

I was looking for a camera to put in my son’s room so that I don’t have to follow him upstairs all day long but can still keep an eye on him.The night vision works great. So far the pictures have been very clear. I also really like the fact that you can use this camera live, so you don’t necessarily need an SD card, unless you want to record and don’t want to buy the cloud service. I do plan on buying another camera for my living room so I will be inserting a micro SD in that camera.I will admit I had a very difficult time connecting the camera to my router. I have dual band WIFI through XFinity. The first time I tried to connect the camera it didn’t work. So I did some research and managed to separate my Wi-Fi into the two separate bands: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. (I had them together under one name and password.) I attempted to connect the camera to the router several more times after that but it still wouldn’t connect. I ended up spending an hour trying to connect the camera to no avail.Finally I noticed in the little instruction booklet that it says you can connect your camera directly through the modem (a modem cable is included in the box the camera came in.) Lo and behold I was able to connect the camera within just a few minutes. I then went into the app and changed the setting from modem to WIFI. I sincerely wish I had tried this method within the first few minutes of failing to connect through the Wi-Fi because it would’ve saved me a lot of time and effort. (There was no need to separate the two bands. Ugh!)I hope this helps anyone else who may be having a difficult time connecting their camera.Overall, great little piece of equipment!","I was a little intimidated about setting up this camera. But I followed the directions slowly and calmly, one step at a time, and everything worked with ease. What fun. The picture is really clear. It is cool that you can move your fingers on the camera screen, wherever you are, and the camera head will rotate accordingly. So you can scan the whole room (350o rotation). And the fact that it includes audio is awesome. So it could also be used as a baby monitor or to hear if your dogs are barking, etc. Or you could talk to the baby, dogs, other adults in the room. One drawback is that the camera has to be connected to USB/power. That greatly limits where I can use it. The instructions are very good for setup, but then it is lacking in real directions on how to use it in everyday use. Most things you can figure out for yourself. Although I have an Alexa device, I was not able to use it with Alexa because it requires an Alexa screen device as well. But overall, I like this camera.","Well this little beauty is sweet. It came within 24 hours (thanks Amazon Prime) and in a nice little box and set up was a breeze (iPhone user). Once you download the application via the App Store, the instructions walk you through set up step by step. You do need your WiFi login, and it does not support 5G WiFi. The sound it makes is a little weird during pairing with WiFi/router connecting but it’s temporary, so you’ll get over it, your sleeping newborn- maybe not so much. Once your set up is complete, you can change the settings for motion detection notification and also sensitivity. I tried stealth mode of moving really slow and also trying to play flash lightening and it caught me on both and sent a notification to my phone of said sloth intruder or lightening McQueen in the house. It has a two way speaker so really nice to be able to yell at the dogs or scare the bejeezus out of your roommate. I’m shocked at the picture quality. I was going to upload a picture of myself in it, but the quality is good that I needed a filter- maybe on their next update. Also, kind of cool that nightmode has its own settings (and throwing it back to the 40s with no color to set the Friday the 13th ambiance) so just in case you want to catch ghosts on camera, I’m sure you can set it to Orb sensitivity. Overall, really great quality product and totally worth the money.","Alright so first off, the price. At 30fps and 1080 with all the extra features. It seemed to good to be true. With that being said, I was eager to play with this one. It comes nicely packaged and about the size of a soda can. Has a two hole mount that can be screwed on many surfaces, walls, ceilings. The mount is an easy twist on so the camera can be taken down with ease. The Picture quality honestly blew me away for a 1080. There’s a lot of 1080s out there that just plain suck. Tethys is true to their word on this one. The night vision is slightly under what they say it can do (32ft I believe) but it’s still plenty of range for your buck. The camera movement is smooth as well. You just swipe down to go up and left to go right and so on. The set up was a little bit of a pain until I realized the manual said something different than what the app tells you to do. Basically just have the camera and your phone right next to the router and it hooks up in seconds. Took me a few tries to realize this. The interface on the app is Fairly easy and any beginner can figure it out. The cloud service does cost money I’m not sure how much. All in all this thing is hard to beat for the price and features packed into it. In the photos in my living room there is a sign way back by the kitchen. The next photo is the camera zoomed in on it to show the quality.","Unit was defective when received. Was asked to move to different locations to see if it would help. I did that and after many tries, it still refused to work wihout the irriataing beep,beep either immediately, or after several ours or days.They want me to pay the return shipping. I won't buy from them again!UPDATE:Original Purchase date Nov.30 2019. Today Feb. 24 2020.I finally did get a replacement and this one works very well. Tethys did send the replacement at no cost and sent a prepaid return label to return the defective camera. They are nice cameras. I bought 2 the first time and only one worked, but after several email exchanges, Tethys made good on their warranty and paid the shipping both ways. Tethys truly seemed to wanted to do the right thing after our email conversations, so I am changing my rating to five stars, 4.5 would be more accurate as it did take longer than it should have to resolve the issue. I do belive the product is a quality item, and I just received a defective one the first time.

It also features NAS recording built in without having to fool with a custom firmware (which may be fixed now) but record to a NAS is easily setup in the recording menu of the EUFY and works perfectly.I do have 2 gripes with the camera...The main one is that there is no 2 factor authentication for my Eufy account. This is concerning because despite not being able to directly view footage or feed from a website, if you use a weak password, someone can theoretically login to the eufy app on their own smart phone and gain access to your camera. Fair enough so use a strong password right? What happens if a hacker decides they want to contact support posing as me and gives them a different email address and has customer support reset the password? I've experienced this and 2FA saved me. What security protocols does Anker support have to follow to ensure that they don't unknowingly unlock my account to someone else?Germany and Canada just recently got 2FA so hopefully the US is close behind. I will not be buying more of these until they get it and will be sticking with wyze until they implement 2fa. If they don't have it by the end of the year, I will update my indoor cams with something else, which may be a shame because right now, no one offers anything NEAR this good of image quality for the price. Maybe ring and Arlo will have an affordable 2k camera by then if Eufy/Anker don't get 2FA established for US customers.Gripe number 2 is that I wish the tilt could tilt a little lower. I tested the cam on a bookshelf and my mantle and it seems like it should be able to look down further than it does so you'd have to prop it up with something under the camera or something like that to get a better look if it's high on a shelf.Honestly, all cloud devices run a risk of some form of security breach. Nothing is bulletproof. I think that I'd be comfortable sticking these in the garage, a workshop, patio, etc.. somewhere outside but nothing on the inside of my home just yet until I know for sure that Anker support couldn't be socially engineered to give access to my account to someone besides me.","I have two of these cameras along with an Eufy doorbell and they are unmatched in my opinion. The A.I. can be set to only send notifications for people. When set for people it ignores cars, moving branches, lightning and animals. It really works as advertised. I have tried many brands of cameras and video doorbells and none can match the Eufy ability to reognize people and not be mislead by other movement. Try one and you will not regret it.","Best bang for your buck camera on the market. I own the 2k doorbell, vacuum and now indoor pan and tilt camera from eufy. They have exceeded my expectations. For a similar price you can find other cameras on amazon however I believe this camera paired along with the app is well worth it. I own outdoor cameras from another company and although the quality is good the app support is awful. That is why I believe eufy’s security line may be my future outdoor setup. The pan and tilt features are easily controlled with the app, notifications are instantaneous and quality is great and you have the ability to use local storage. Looking forward for this company to keep adding and improving their products.","The camera is compact and well designed, setup is super easy. The 2K images are impressive and the two-way audio is great. The smart AI been very good just sometimes individual false detections(I understand it is difficult to be 100% accurate).I’m Apple HomeKit user, this camera's HomeKit function works fine, and even supports HomeKit Secure Video! I am very satisfied with getting so many features at such a great price.","The image and build quality at this price point is truly hard to believe. This camera has both human and pet detection, either one can be turned on or off. The human detection is accurate, as is the pet detection. The really cool feature is that it snaps a face shot of whichever animal, human or pet, and has it as the icon on that particular event it was detected for a quick and easy determination of who set off the camera alert.There’s no going wrong with this camera. You’ll need a micro sd card if you want to save events, or pay for cloud storage.

I only had one problem in setting it up, and that was realizing that was indeed an user manual stored in the packing, inside the box. Once I found this it was simple to set up and put into operation. I had charged it prior to doing the setup. The user manual stepped me through the instillation of the software and connecting to my wireless network and I was up and running.

With this camera we see way fewer and much more accurate notifications. This is especially nice when we are away from home and can track if someone enters the kennel without our knowledge.

It was too expensive for my budget, so I bought the 4 camera expandable system they have.Before ordering I had some questions about it, so I emailed Mr. Johnny from the company, and he responded within an hour, and answered everything I had concerns with. Tell me, which company answers customer emails within an hour??After testing and playing with that system, and finding out that it is so easy to set up, it is LEGIT plug-and-play. Since I wanted to be able to talk to someone at my front door, so I ordered the dome camera. I just played with this camera, and wow it is beyond good. I can CLEARLY talk to and listen to anyone, from their free app. This dome camera can also be controlled and rotated automatically through the app. And the floodlight is so bright it can light up the whole place.I played around with the cameras in the dark, in the light, with sounds, the microphone, etc. Overall, this system is as good or better than the professional systems that cost thousands that I have had in the past.This system is so good that it actually has AI face and body detection, and also notifies your phone each time it detects something.If you want a really good single camera or want to add on to your existing system, that is easy to use, and really well priced, legit get this system.","We added this to our existing NVR system. We feel even more secure with the 2 way audio. We were planning on purchasing a ring by Amazon before, but with this camera, the ring is no longer needed.Pros:- connects to our existing NVR system- works well on the app- able to view more with the PTZ viewing control.- 2 way audio should deter people from doing questionable activities- we placed it close to our motion sensor light so it will have great visibility even at night.Cons- a little bulky- I had a little trouble getting the video to show on our NVR system. Connection was easy. Video playback just took me some further looking into.Despite the cons, I still give it a 5-star since I was able to find a solution and the bulkiness isn't that big of a deal.","Notable upgrades in this latest release include FULL COLOR night vision using white LED's or more traditional IR night vision. Two way audio, built in siren, though I have not even tried that as I am scared of false alarms being a nuisance. If you are looking for an outdoor security camera you want it to handle as many functions as possible in one unit. By allowing for pan and tilt, I can have this mounted where I can look out in many directions and see many things in the front and side of the property. Equally versatile is you can use this camera with the App (including on your computer) or hook in with your Hiseeu NVR if you go that route. Customer service from these folks is always top notch.",999,313,https://www.amazon.com/Hiseeu-Floodlights-Waterproof-Compatible-WHD303/dp/B08JYMYPCM/ref=sr_1_32?keywords=360+security+camera&qid=1640229433&sr=8-32
