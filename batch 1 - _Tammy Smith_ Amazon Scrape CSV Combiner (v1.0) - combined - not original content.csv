I am blow away by the value of this pillow. It wasn't pricey at all and yet it is top-notch quality. I put it in the dryer for 5 minutes (air fluff only) and then allowed it to naturally expand for two days on my bed. It really filled out nicely. This pillow is super supportive and comfortable, I love it! I use it to read in bed, but my cats also like snuggling up to it when I'm not using it (it is like a spare lap to them). I am only 5'1"" and thought that this looked too small, but for me it is just right. It is very sturdy and could most certainly support someone larger than me. Also... Confirmed: people don't follow instructions. The product description *clearly* states (as does the paper that comes with this product) that this pillow needs to be fluffed. Ignore the reviewers claiming it is 'unusable' due to being flat. If you don't understand how compression works, you need more support than a pillow can provide.",I Love it!! And so does my dog Ringo!!,My pillow came earlier than it said and we have only had it 2 days and it’s perfect. But now I’m going to have to buy another one because my dog took it from me!,Great support for the back and hips. Will make my gaming and reading sessions more fun!!!,"I am going in for hip surgery in a couple of weeks. I purchased this to aid in sitting up on the couch. Item arrived quickly and well packaged. We fluffed it up as it was nicely vacuumed sealed. This has been great for my back and fits perfectly against the back of the couch. Arm rests a bit low, but this has been a great addition to the house. Also is great to use on the bed.",Perfect for comfort & for post-op surgery needs with support to the back,"My husband bought this reading chair pillow for me and it is amazing!! I recently, as in a little over a week ago, had much needed surgery on my lower back. It's really hard to sit comfortably! This item was delivered in the time period that was expected. However as a Prime Member we expected it in less than the 3 days it took. But, honestly, even waiting 3 days for delivery and then another 24-48 hours for it to ""grow"" (that was fun watching my husband take this out of a small, tight shipping box and then see it's full size without the full expansion was unexpected!!( I'm now sitting comfortably in my pillow reading chair in my bed!! It's giving me GREAT support of the area that was surgically repaired while being very comfortable for the rest!! Stacking pillows for support is something I'll never have the need to do again anytime soon!! I'm considering ordering a couple more for my daughters as they have issues with their backs as well!! I GREATLY recommend this to anyone!! It doesn't matter if you have back issues, other, or not! It's just plain comfy!!!",Pleasantly surprised !!,"Bought this because being propped up using pillows to read in bed wasn't cutting it. Needed something better and this was what I was looking for. Followed the instructions on how to decompress the cushion and literally within minutes the cushion was to the point I could use it comfortably. AND, the side pocket is a perfect place to keep my Amazon Fire Stick. ALSO, didn't hurt that the grey color matched the color scheme my wife is building around. Happy wife !!"

Can't comment on durability as time will tell (just been using for 4 days). I will buy another one. We use it on our sectional sofa for tv watching (and dozing). Fabric is soft.,"Soft yet firm, Unbelievable comfort",I actually almost cancelled my order for this pillow because of a naysayer. I am so happy I did not. It is incredible. Very firm yet very soft. I use it sitting on floor leaning against couch. I even use it for a pillow for sitting halfway up. I have had 6 surgeries and there are so many ways to use this awesome pillow. It has removable cover as well. I will order another.,DO NOT BUY.,"This should actually be a one-star review, but then you wouldn't have read it. Regardless of the many positive reviews, this bed pillow is overstuffed, hard on the back, and very heavy to move around. Also, the product description makes it seems like child's play to add or remove the shredded foam to Increase or decrease the pillow’s softness. Don’t believe it. It’s a pain to do it ... if you can do it at all. And, If you want to return it, that’s another nightmare, since it’s shipped to the customer highly compressed by machine, in a box that you will never get it back into. Since you must pack this item for return (no, the shipper will not do it free for you) .... you will have to find a very large carton, a lot of packing tape, and possibly a lot of bubble wrap. Then, it may not fit into your vehicle unless it’s an SUV or truck. End of story. Consider ordering a different one.",Helping with recovery!,"I got this for my almost 11 year old daughter as a Christmas gift. She specifically asked for this and loves it. She's got it set up in the corner of her bed and loves to read while snuggled against it, or do homework while it supports her back. But the unexpected use has been for me. On New Years Eve I very suddenly had to deliver a baby 8 weeks early. The emergency surgery resulted in severe trauma and injury to my torso beyond what a c section already entails. I cannot lie flat and am unable to sit up on my own. I asked to borrow this so I could sit on the couch without sinking back into the cushions. It worked for that, so I turned it to the side and am currently lounging comfortably with my feet up. This is so comfy! I don't feel any lumps or weird spots. The fabric is soft, no smells. The arms are just right to prop my elbows up on. So I'm totally going to order another one to keep on the couch because I can see how this will be great even after this painful recovery process is done. I'm impressed!",Every bed needs one!,"I almost didn't try this bc I saw a couple of reviews that criticized the size of the 18 inch version as small, but I am so happy that I took a shot. The size is perfect for me, average height and weight female. I work from home a lot, using a lapdesk and now this, sitting on my bed, and this is so comfy and supportive, as described and for an awesome price considering the amount of memory foam that went into this. The cover is thin, but really soft. I won't mind having to recover it shortly if that's the case. Thank you!"

Kind of glad I ignored a lot of the complaints about this one. There were a lot of complaints about having to fluff it up, how it didn’t evenly fluff up and that it had an odd smell. I found none of this to be true. Mine smells perfectly fine and I am including two photos that were taken immediately upon cutting it out of the shrink wrap plastic it came in. I didn’t have to fluff it at all, that’s what it looks like right out of the plastic. So far so comfy. I purchased a roll pillow for under my knees to help with better back support.

I absolutely love it. Don’t forget to register yours for their warranty! I’ll be doing the same tonight :)","A+ product, Comfy Yet Sturdy","I bought this based on other amazon reviews. There are cheaper products you can buy at Target etc but this is quality. You get what you paid for. I was skeptical because it comes in a small box and when you unwrap it the foam is compressed and it looks like garbage. However with this said, after you take the time to fluff it up and let the foam expand it is amazing. Don't be fooled! I am actually using it as I write this review. A+ product",Five Stars,Love this reading pillow. Perfect for reading. No more back pains,Pillow for Breastfeeding in bed,"I bought this pillow for nursing my second child while laying/sitting in bed. I learned the first time around how strenuous it can be on your back. If you're looking for a pillow for that reason, stop looking and click ""purchase"", because oh my gosh, this is THE breastfeeding pillow. I'm literally feeding him right now while writing this, my back is well supported and I'm comfortable. I leaned back the other day to close my eyes while nursing and smooshed the filling around to get my head a little more comfortable, and it totally works with you. Love this pillow."

I've had several before and have never really loved them... they were okay, but not great. But, this one is superb! I was on bedrest for two weeks following surgery and this was perfect! It's easily adjustable (you can fluff it up, or force the foam in to condense), comfortable, and a great size! I've used it on my bed and sofas, and it fits on all -- the backside isn't super deep, so it's a bit easier to use on certain pieces of furniture that don't give a ton of space to put something behind you. My *only* concern (not even a complaint, just something to keep in mind) is the buttons and elastic straps for the headrest. I'm afraid that overtime, it will eventually lose elasticity and sag. No issues yet, just concerned that may be an issue down the road - as I've run into it with an older reading pillow. Besides that, this is a great buy and I'd get it again if I had the chance! Five stars!!!!!",perfect,I love this pillow. It's huge and soft like a giant teddy bear. It's so supportive of my neck and lower back. I'll be having shoulder surgery soon and will need to sleep sitting up. This will be perfect. No trying to stack pillows that will only slide around and give no support at all.,Most favorite pillow in the house!!,"This is by far my favorite pillow! I bought it to make an office in bed. And this pillow worked very well and is very, very, very, very comfortable! I can't get my kids off of it and catching the 9 ear old napping on it when I am not around.🤣🤣🤣 Perfect if doing school work or working from home, napping, if you're sick or had surgery and need to elevate. I am definitely buying more to appease everyone else who's reckness eyeballing my pillow and coming up with a plan of action to snatch it up!",One Giant Pillow!,"I really like this pillow! As you can see it expanded quite well and is firm but comfortable and supportive. For me, I like the additional tube pillow more at the bottom to support my lower back, as shown in my picture. I got the 24"" because I was concerned the smaller one wouldn't have supported my neck for sleep, because I didn't get this pillow for reading in bed, I got it for digestive reasons. I usually have to sit up about halfway through the night and my old pillow was no longer working, this one fits the bill! I like the height of the arm rests too, fits me comfortably. I like the coral pink that I chose too, it's pretty much coral or a rosy pink.",Plenty of Support,"This pillow provides plenty of firm support from my lower back to my shoulder blades when sitting up straight. It also works well when I stretch out and use it to support my upper back, head, and neck. For an in-between position of slouching, there is no support for my lower back, which I guess is a good thing because it discourages that bad habit. The cover for the pillow is velour and very pleasing to the touch. The zipper that allows you to remove the cover for washing is sturdy and should be durable. I haven’t removed the cover yet, but I’m hopeful it won’t involve a bit of a circus trick to get the pillow back inside. Overall, this pillow is far superior to standard bed pillows when it comes to proper support for reading in bed."

I wanted a big, tall back rest pillow and this is exactly what I was looking for. Very high quality. It came with the cover detached from the actual pillow so you just have to put the cover on it. It comes vaccum sealed in a gray plastic bag. I ripped the bag open and then I started separating the chunks of foam on the inside and I also shook the pillow. Since I'm very petite, I shook it against my bed instead of in mid air. I did this until all of the chunks were seprated in pieces which took about 7 minutes. Then I just let it sit for 24 hours. It fluffed up so nicely. Then I put the pillow cover on. It wasn't to hard to put on. Only took 3 minutes or so. The color is very nice. It's bright but not too hot pink or neon. It has a small pocket on the right arm and a large one on the back. And also, the pillow came a lot quicker than I expected. The only bad thing was the price. The shipping made the pillow cost almost $75. PS- The last picture showing the back pocket it the picture that best depicts the actual color of the pink pillow.",Comfortable upright support following surgery,"I purchased this husband specifically for upright support in bed following abdominal surgery. It took over 24 hours for the foam to expand, but despite this delay, the pillow with its well/designed arms and removable neck pillow proved to be a good size and height for me to be supported comfortably and to get some rest while in an upright position. A lot cheaper than investing in a hospital bed. Add a handrail to tuck under mattress and you have a perfect combination to solve the problem of getting out of bed and resting upright while in post-surgical recovery mode.",Supportive Backrest + Your Purchase Supports Ocean Cleanup Project.,"Supportive backrest - memory foam cradles your back with a comforting warmth. The seller included a free gift with my purchase - a nice surprise. In a follow up e-mail, I learned that "" a portion of every single purchase is donated to the Ocean Cleanup Project"" - a foundation that develops technologies to extract plastic pollution from oceans around the world. Buying a great product and helping to clean up our oceans is a win-win in my book.",Comfortable,"This pillow is awesome! It came in the cover, very well packaged. I opened the zippers and fluffed it all up by hand. It's already very full and comfortable, and the photo was taken 20 minutes after opening the box. If it expands even more I may have to remove some filling! I plan on using this for sleeping after surgery on my nose/sinuses. I want sure about the removable round pillow, thinking it would be uncomfortable, but it isn't at all. I also like that the straps that attach the round pillow to the buttons are stitched into divisions so that you can adjust how far down you want the round pillow to hang. I'm so glad that I chose this pillow over the other pillows. I'm 5'4"" with a long torso, and with the round pillow placed on top it's the perfect size. I also love the soft cover. Worth every penny. I will definitely be buying another for my husband! This would be a great gift for anyone. Even my cat likes it :)",Worth Every Penny...WOW!,"MY mom likes to watch tv in bed but was always worried about her posture—she has osteoporosis and her pillow just made her slouch too much. Got the Husband Pillow for her for Christmas and she LOVES it! It’s much taller and provides better back support. The added neck pillow is buttoned in and can be adjusted, so you can get it at just the right angle. Plus there’s a big zipper on the bottom so you can wash the cover...her other pillow didn’t have that. I just tried it and wow...looks like I may be ordering two more for my husband and I! Guess we’ll see how it holds up over time...keeping our fingers crossed!"

It would also work well to put it on the floor against the couch for those who like sitting on the floor. The fabric is a nice gray color and very soft to touch. It's sort of a cross between velvet and velour. The cover has a zipper and is removable.

It has a carry handle and a pocket on one of the arm rests. I got this to give as a gift but I may have to keep it! It fits me perfectly!,Couldn’t have asked for a better reading pillow!,"I toyed with the idea of getting a reading pillow for quite a while, but I wanted to make sure I chose the right one for multiple reasons; 1) my job is very physically demanding, so I’ve been experiencing neck and back issues, and 2) I’m broader than the average guy, so I needed one that wasn’t going to feel like just another throw pillow behind my back. I researched and researched. I added pillows to my cart, compared quality and price, then removed them because I felt they didn’t add up. Finally, I pulled the trigger on this one, and I’m glad I did!",Best purchase ever!,"So, it’s not that soft, but it’s better that it’s not. I got this because I’m a student and have to lock myself in my bedroom a lot to study. It’s not comfortable leaving against a wall or headboard. So I got this for when I’m studying or reading in my bed, trying to escape my noisy family. I’m 5’4. But I ordered the big one so I would have support all the way up my back. I had been having a lot of neck pain from looking down so much. I do NOT use the detachable roll at the top because... I’m 5’4” and it sits on my head. Without it, this thing is seriously the best money I’ve ever spent. I feel like I’m relaxing in a very nice chair but I’m on my bed. It’s nice and firm and conforms to my back. Just soft enough without being too soft. This was one of my most favorite amazon purchases ever. Don’t buy any other version, get this one. The quality is absolutely fabulous. Well worth the money!",Super comfortable and easy to adjust!,"I absolutely love this reading pillow! I've had several before and have never really loved them... they were okay, but not great. But, this one is superb! I was on bedrest for two weeks following surgery and this was perfect! It's easily adjustable (you can fluff it up, or force the foam in to condense), comfortable, and a great size! I've used it on my bed and sofas, and it fits on all -- the backside isn't super deep, so it's a bit easier to use on certain pieces of furniture that don't give a ton of space to put something behind you. My *only* concern (not even a complaint, just something to keep in mind) is the buttons and elastic straps for the headrest. I'm afraid that overtime, it will eventually lose elasticity and sag. No issues yet, just concerned that may be an issue down the road - as I've run into it with an older reading pillow. Besides that, this is a great buy and I'd get it again if I had the chance! Five stars!!!!!",Solid and sturdy. Great support!,"I bought this specifically for the bedrest I would have after leg surgery. I wanted something with firm support yet versatile for when I was recuperated. It came vaccum sealed ( sanitary is important!) . I followed the instructions and with a little shaking and repositioning it opened up! There was not any odor from the pillow. I am five foot eight and the pillow supports my long torso even without the removable cylinder pillow. I have been using it almost 2 months now. I have no complaints. It is solid, supporting and I love how I can position the extra pillow for my neck Nd there are arm supports."

SUPER SOFT and so comfortable. Thanks for making such an incredible product. Great to lean against too, but I prefer it for my legs.",Worth It's Money!,"Outer material is so nice and soft. I bought for my husband who had major shoulder surgery (his third) five weeks ago. I just wish I'd found it sooner. After having to sleep in recliner every night, he actually slept in our bed all night last night. I will suggest this to everyone I know who has rotator cuff surgery!",I so needed this,"I've been having a really hard time sleeping at night, not only because of GERD but just because I can't seem to get comfortable. I'm a side sleeper, so I didn't think a bed wedge would work well for me, but it turns out I don't turn on my side nearly as often when I'm sleeping on this wedge. When I do, I just fold my arms up like I do when I'm sleeping flat on a pillow, and it's fine. I thought I was going to want to tip this wedge up tall for watching TV, but I actually prefer to leave it on the lower incline, which is how I sleep on it, too. I picked up the Intevision 12"" wedge cover to have an added layer of protection, and it fits loosely and is just fine. (Somebody said the 7.5"" fits this one, but I didn't get that one because I was afraid it would be hard to get on and off.) A bonus of this wedge is that Bingo, my chiweenie, doesn't seem to want to sleep on top of my head as much as he used to. I guess it's because he's spooked by the incline. Not having him on my head all night helps me get better sleep, too.",Buy THIS Pillow First & You Won’t Waste Money on Others!!,"Great Loved it and I Highly Recommend THIS specific Pillow over the flimsy one that has a light blue cover!! Save Your Money and Order THIS Pillow FIRST! It’s Firm and it’s Been SO Much Better than any of the other’s I have tried, (and I’ve tried 5 total including this one)!"

I switched it with lovehome memory foam lumbar foam and it wouldn’t give adequate support to the lumbar region and I felt my back was not comfortable and supported. The build quality was equally good but the everlasting has no chemical smell at all while lovehome had a lot of chemical smell. So for me, everlasting comfort back support wins!","3,000 Mile Road Trip in 2 Weeks","A 2-hour drive used to do me in, with a soar hip and back. Put this to the test during a 2-week 3,000 mile road trip. Fortunately, I asked my chiropractor ahead of time how to survive it without feeling stiff with hip and back pain. He suggested I get a cushion with lumbar support, so after researching various options I bought this one... actually two of them, one for the driver and one for the passenger. For the first hour or two, I didn't necessarily like it and it felt a bit unnatural. After I got more used to it, I realized it helped... a lot... a whole lot! My traveling companion felt the same way. We both remained pain-free and were not stiff at all the entire trip or afterward! After about 2,000 miles, I ordered an additional one for my husband so he could start using one right away. He also feels this helps him remain comfortable and pain-free. He had an old lumbar cushion in his car but said this one is much better. When I sang the praises of this to a friend who drives 2-hours daily, unbeknownst to me, she had already gotten this exact one and loves it. So this makes four very happy ""campers"" between the ages of 21 and 71, with different body-types. This is one of the best purchases I have ever made and think this would make an excellent gift. If you ever feel soar after being in the car, you can do something about it by getting one of these. It makes all the difference... just give it a couple of hours to get used to it.","Finally, relief!","I recently switched jobs, and the chair at my new job killed my back. I had tried a couple of different styles of back support for my chair that I had purchased locally, and my back pain still continued. After reading many reviews for similar products on Amazon, I decided to give this one a try. After the first day, I noticed a huge difference and my back didn't hurt as much. The only complaint I have is that even after tightening the straps as tight as they will go, they're still a little loose on the back of my chair and I have to adjust the back cushion a couple times per day. I don't think this is a fault of the product, but due to the fact that my chair back at work is slimmer than most office chairs. However, because of the relief it's provided, I would buy again. Oh, and I love the extension straps to allow for this to be used in my car, if needed.",I'd say this was definitely the best choice one can make,"As a software developer, this is exactly what I was looking. Between choosing a brand new ""gaming"" type chair that can help me sit for hours (Meaning i'd have to replace my computer chair that was not cheap), or choosing this ""EverLasting Comfort"". I'd say this was definitely the best choice one can make. Comes with double straps for tight grip. Well worth it for the price.",Everlasting comfort Pillow,I absolutely love this memory foam support pillow. I was in a car accident not too long ago and my back hasn't been the same since. This pillow does relief some comfort by the way its shaped. It hugs my back perfectly and relieves stress on my back. It is sturdy and straps on nicely to my work chair. I am going to have to buy another one for my home. Can't thank this maker enough.

They arrived crisp and clean.",AMAZING!!!,I have been searching for over a year for some pillows that were amazing without spending a small fortune. These popped up on a facebook ad and I read all the mixed reviews...most people saying they were good but several people complaining that they arrived moldy. 1. They arrived in perfect condition. No mold whatsoever!!! 2. My all time favorite pillows are feather pillows. They are next to impossible to find. These actually remind me of a feather pillow without feathers. Do not hesitate to buy these. You will not be disappointed. Especially at this price!!!,Mine were perfect and still are!,"Mine arrived pitifully flat in a sealed package; but it was amusing to watch them puff-up after the seal was broken. They quickly became very full and fluffy, but to my delight, substantial. I experienced absolutely no problems: no mold, no odor whatsoever. They’re beautiful and comfy after weeks of hard use and cleaning. I say “hard use” because I’m currently experiencing a nasty flare from an auto-immune disease which keeps me close to my bed. I sleep on these pillows, and prop-up on them during the day. They’ve been so helpful for me that I got a set for my daughter. I plan to buy more!",Great pillow no issues!,"Took a chance on these, was really worried about the moldy pictures on here. I made SURE to order from the actual seller as there did seem to be at least one re-seller AND the buy button for some reason automatically was set to the re-seller even though the products were all the same price. Anyway, so they arrived from Beckham and no mold and in fact I am happy with the pillow. For side sleeping this is one of the very few pillows where it is just the right height and I don't have to use a second pillow with it. No mold, no wierd smells, everything arrived great and check who you're buying from before you submit an order thank you."

It also works well when I stretch out and use it to support my upper back, head, and neck. For an in-between position of slouching, there is no support for my lower back, which I guess is a good thing because it discourages that bad habit. The cover for the pillow is velour and very pleasing to the touch. The zipper that allows you to remove the cover for washing is sturdy and should be durable. I haven’t removed the cover yet, but I’m hopeful it won’t involve a bit of a circus trick to get the pillow back inside. Overall, this pillow is far superior to standard bed pillows when it comes to proper support for reading in bed.",Solid and sturdy. Great support!,"I bought this specifically for the bedrest I would have after leg surgery. I wanted something with firm support yet versatile for when I was recuperated. It came vaccum sealed ( sanitary is important!) . I followed the instructions and with a little shaking and repositioning it opened up! There was not any odor from the pillow. I am five foot eight and the pillow supports my long torso even without the removable cylinder pillow. I have been using it almost 2 months now. I have no complaints. It is solid, supporting and I love how I can position the extra pillow for my neck Nd there are arm supports.",One Giant Pillow!,"I really like this pillow! As you can see it expanded quite well and is firm but comfortable and supportive. For me, I like the additional tube pillow more at the bottom to support my lower back, as shown in my picture. I got the 24"" because I was concerned the smaller one wouldn't have supported my neck for sleep, because I didn't get this pillow for reading in bed, I got it for digestive reasons. I usually have to sit up about halfway through the night and my old pillow was no longer working, this one fits the bill! I like the height of the arm rests too, fits me comfortably. I like the coral pink that I chose too, it's pretty much coral or a rosy pink.",Super comfortable and easy to adjust!,"I absolutely love this reading pillow! I've had several before and have never really loved them... they were okay, but not great. But, this one is superb! I was on bedrest for two weeks following surgery and this was perfect! It's easily adjustable (you can fluff it up, or force the foam in to condense), comfortable, and a great size! I've used it on my bed and sofas, and it fits on all -- the backside isn't super deep, so it's a bit easier to use on certain pieces of furniture that don't give a ton of space to put something behind you. My *only* concern (not even a complaint, just something to keep in mind) is the buttons and elastic straps for the headrest. I'm afraid that overtime, it will eventually lose elasticity and sag. No issues yet, just concerned that may be an issue down the road - as I've run into it with an older reading pillow. Besides that, this is a great buy and I'd get it again if I had the chance! Five stars!!!!!",Couldn’t have asked for a better reading pillow!,"I toyed with the idea of getting a reading pillow for quite a while, but I wanted to make sure I chose the right one for multiple reasons; 1) my job is very physically demanding, so I’ve been experiencing neck and back issues, and 2) I’m broader than the average guy, so I needed one that wasn’t going to feel like just another throw pillow behind my back. I researched and researched. I added pillows to my cart, compared quality and price, then removed them because I felt they didn’t add up. Finally, I pulled the trigger on this one, and I’m glad I did!"

I had straight hair again a month later. But I plugged in this baby and tried it out on my gross post-gym hair yesterday, just to see what happened before I showered, and it WORKED!!!! So I showered, actually blow-dried my hair (I never do that) just so I could REALLY try it out: I did my whole head, again, NO PRODUCTS AT ALL and here I am reporting back to you live, 24 hrs later, and I'm still flaunting my beach waves!!!!

I was actually looking for something with barrels a little bit bigger, but I ended up going for this one because of the price point and reviews. I'm glad I did, I love it. You can do a couple different things with it, to give a beautiful wave effect or a crimpy effect. I did more of a crimpy pattern in the photo, but I've also done the wave pattern too and it's beautiful. I do waves by putting the the tool directly on the next section of hair that the last ""wave"" pattern ended. I do crimpy style by clamping the hair tool on each section of hair in 3 or 4 different places, about an inch or 2 apart from each other. I dont use any hair spray and the waves last for a couple of days!! It also doesnt burn your hair as long as you use the right setting. This is awesome because I had tried a Lange products before and no matter what setting it was on, my hair always smelled burned for days.",Great product,This wave iron is amazing. It works fantastically. I love it,Great waver deffinitely recommend,"The media could not be loaded. I received this yesterday and I just tried it out really fast and I loved it so far!! I have thinner hair I only used between 10 and 15 for heat, i did big sections just to try it out and only put a little bit of hairspray in. My hair doesn't hold curls well and it dId with this. It got hot fast and it held great all night and my hair is still wavy today. I am a lefty and I turned the dial a little but it really wasn't a problem.

I haven't found any products I really ""love"" on my natural hair, so I've just accepted it being huge and out of control all the time. Then I started watching Sex and the City and began to strive for Carrie Bradshaw season 1 curls. They were so, so similar to my hair natural but 10x better. After trying every hair styling product on the market I gave up and decided there must be a styling tool to help with this. I tried different sized wands and flat irons and everything I could think of before stumbling upon the ""Deep Waver."" I really wanted this model but it didn't have automatic shut off and I didn't want to burn my house down, so I ended up buying this ""A-Wave-We-Go"" model solely because it has auto off. I freaking love this thing. My hair notoriously takes me over an hour to do, it's super thick, and I can do my entire head start to finish in about ten minutes now. I like to do varying wave styles throughout my hair, and the only bad thing I'd say about this is the knob to change the wave style is kind of hard to turn. I usually have to put some kind of cloth over it to get a grip on it and turn it. But even so I still give this 5 stars. I get compliments on my hair all the time after using this and it's so easy to use. It took me about four months to actually convince myself to buy this and I wish I got it sooner.",Total game changer!,This is a dream come true for me. I have short thin hair that is stick straight and doesn’t hold a curl very long. The “A Wave We Go” was so easy and quick for me to get the wavy look I was hoping even the first try. Each curl took 5 seconds to create. Then a light spray after and crunch with hands to set. That’s it! I’ve read from other reviews that the waves last 3 days or so. What a valuable hair tool I’ve found!! I’ve been using this tool for a couple weeks and am convinced it’s the most useful thing I’ve ever had to use to create a full and wavy hair style effect. I can now grow my hair longer.,Awesome,I was able to get perfect waves fast and easy. Added pics of me with flat hair then with waves. It doesn't take too much from your length either,If you start higher up like a regular curling iron you get curly hair not ...,"You must play with it for awhile. With shoulder or longer length hair start the first wave at the knows, or chin line then go down trying to make only two three waves down. If you start higher up like a regular curling iron you get curly hair not waves.if your hair is thick the curly will look like an Afro, the only thing I can do at that point is pull it up and back. Just don’t expect to get it picture perfect the first few times,you will need time to explore just how to use it. Not to try 30 minutes before your going out.",Love it!,Easy to use and fast. I get so many compliments on my hair.

This is the only product that's ever turned my stick-straight hair into beachy waves!,"Full disclosure–I've never written an Amazon review before but I'm absolutely OBSESSED with this product, so I came straight here after only 10 mins of using it today. A social media influencer I follow briefly mentioned this product in one of her videos and said she'd had it for six years, and that it was far better than any other product she had used to achieve the same wavy look. I went ahead and ordered it without much thought because it was so affordable, relative to other products I had seen. It arrived in a day and a half (2 days max?) and I ran straight to plug it in. Without so much as reading any instructions, as it was pretty self-explanatory, I was able to curl my entire head of hair, and without any hairspray or product, they still look like I just put them in six hours later. This is unheard of for me, as my straight hair refuses to hold curl...ever. This was arguably the quickest I've ever been able to curl all of my hair too, and with minimal effort since there's no spinning of the wand or wrapping hair around a barrel. It's as simple as it looks. I will seriously be using this every single day from here out!",Beach waves,"This contraption works wonders on my flat and limp hair. It turns my flat hair into attractive beachy waves in under 40 minutes. My only dislike about this product is that it does take me some time to get through my whole head of hair, but that is the price to pay for lovely locks!",I'm not disappointed at all,"I lost my first one that I bought at Ulta years ago. So, I came on Amazon to find the same one. It works just as expected! I'm not disappointed at all. Love it! @ellexxandra",A crimper for 2020!,"I was just looking for something else easy to do with my hair that wasn't basic curls, and I am not one that spends time doing my hair everyday. This is reminiscent of the ol crimper from the 80's but updated and not as tight waves - it gives you volume and a simple easy look! Kind of like you just took your hair down from a braid, very easy style you could dress up or just wear to the beach. It is a little bulky but I like that so you can stick a long row of hair in - If I am going fast I can do it all in 5 minutes or 10 if I am really getting a good wave. Works really good on day 2 hair with a little bumble and bumble dry shampoo for hold. So glad I bought this!",Easy and Quick!,"I used to have longer (bra strap length) hair and it held the wave. Now my hair is a little past collar bone length and it’s just as great! Super easy to use and faster than curling (for me). It does get HOT so use a heat protectant spray and you’ll be good to go! For someone who struggles with doing anything other than a pony tail, I love this item. Side note: my sisters hair is super long and never holds a curl. I used this on her and the waves lasted through the night. When she woke up the next morning her hair still had a wave in it to where she didn’t have to do anything to it!"

I have very straight hair naturally and my hair does not hold curl more than a few hours. A few years ago, I bought the Bedhead wave maker and have loved this style ever since. I also get a lot of compliments whenever I use it. The Bedhead wave maker, however, makes very tight waves and I wanted a wave maker that makes looser waves, so I began searching for a tool that will make a loser wave. After a lot of research, I settled on this one. I will definitely use it over my Bedhead wave maker for these reasons: Pros: 1. The waves are loser, which is exactly the style I wanted. 2. I love the kick stand so the hot iron doesn't rest on the counter. 3. You can choose between two temperatures The Bedhead wave maker has none of these features. In addition, the Bedhead wave maker naturally stays open. It has a lock bottom to keep it closed, however after a few years of owning it, that bottom has broken and the only way to keep it locked is to wrap the cord around it. Overall, I highly recommend this wave maker for loose beach waves.",Easy & Good Quality Hair Curler,"I have stick straight hair and it always takes forever to curl it. I got my iron super fast! Which was nice to have something ship actually Prime. But this took me about 5 minutes to do one side. I was a little nervous but it was easier to use than expected. I used the lowest setting and took about 2-3 in sections. I also have really fine hair, so depending on how thick your hair is depends on the size of section you would do. I loved how easy it was to use, and the waves have lasted with no hair spray. Normally when I used a traditional curling iron I have to use hair spray. It heats up quickly, and the heat seems evenly dispersed. Looking forward to using this, this weekend when I go out. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, as it really makes curling your hair much faster! Love it, happy I bought it for sure.",Works on short and dyed hair!,"An absolutely amazing product!! At first I wasn’t sure if it would work since I have shorter hair, but it gave me the perfect amount of body! Takes a second to get used to the large size of the barrels, but after that it’s a breeze! Takes way less time than curling my hair usually does. Overall, 10/10",AMAZING PRODUCT!,"As you can probably tell, I have very thick hair. So I was giving up on finding a product that would work for my hair. I have tried to get this style with a wand, straighter, curling iron. But my hair is so thick it was hard to hold in. And I could never get this style with any of them! I am so beyond excited I found this. When I picked my son up from school the first thing he said was ""Wow mom I love your hair. You look so beautiful"" so this is now my everyday hair! 😅😍🥰",Nice curler!,"So, usually I straighten my hair, then curl the ends for more volume with the straightening iron. I decided to try this to see if it would be better. Shipping was super fast: it shipped a few hours after I ordered and arrived a day before estimation. I was a bit overwhelmed when I took it out of the box (let's face it: it's big), but it's pretty easy to maneuver. I definitely need to practice how to make the waves I'm looking for, but I'm satisfied with what I've done so far. There are two heat settings. Be careful with both, as I have a pretty gnarly burn on my chin (don't ask). And it heats very quickly!"

Less bulky. My BH waver is harder to maneuver when I'm doing the back of my head and I end up burning my neck. 2. This waver gives smaller softer waves. To be fair, I think BH offers a smaller size than the one I have. The size of this particular waver is perfect and doesn't shrink my hair up too much 3. DIGITAL TEMPERATURE GAUGE!!!! I am visually impaired and have a hard time reading the rolling dials most curlers and flat irons use, including BH. This one has a well lit digital screen so I never struggle to read what setting I'm on. My hair is over processed and can fry in an instant on a setting that it too hot. Overall, I like this product and it has become my primary styling tool. I've used it steadily for three weeks and have had no issue.",Beautiful wave,"I have very fine, flyaway hair and just got a cut that is shorter than I'd like with too-choppy layers. I was looking for something that would give me some wave without losing any length (curling irons make it look shorter) and this is absolutely perfect! Gives a nice beautiful wave that blends my layers in - it looks nice and neat, and no length at all is lost. I love this!!!",Love my three barrel curling iron,"Love my three barrel curling iron. I'm one of those that cannot for the life of me figure out how to curl my hair with a single barrel or a straightener. My hand just does not want to cooperate or maybe my brain is overthinking it, anyway, the three barrel curling iron is a game changer for me. I have super straight hair, so straight that air dried is a suitable style for me. I've always wanted to be able to curl my hair and Alure has made that possible! My waves are beachy just like they promise and I've received tons of compliments from friends, coworkers, etc. And for those that have difficulties with other forms of curling, the three barrel is super easy to use. However, it takes me closer to 45 minutes to do all of my hair. I'm probably just slow and figuring it out and/or I have a lot of hair.",Looking👀 for beach waves?🏖 🌊 Get this!😍,"If your like me...This is PERFECT for you! YES you can get beach waves,Even if you don’t know how to use a curler or straightener! I bought this because I don’t know🤷🏼‍♀️how to curl my hair with a straightener OR curler. I’ve watched DIY videos on YouTube but I can never get my curls to go in the right direction. I’ve also tried recreating beach waves with a straighter,from YouTube vids.👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 None of which have worked for me. I then searched YouTube videos on how to use this 3 barrel wand and was impressed with how easy it is to use. I purchased this item and am extremely happy with it! I am IN LOVE 😍 with my beach waves! Beach waves 🌊 that I have never been able to accomplish via straighteners or curlers☹️ TIP: it took me a small 18mins to get a full head of beautiful beach waves! 🕰 😃😃 Temperature control is decent, it has clear large numbers that show you the temperature. It’s super easy to use!",Make natural looking waves that last all day! Love this product!,"LOVE this!!! Was so easy to use and made my hair SUPER wavy. The curls lasted for a couple days even! The pic I show is from at the end of the day and it's STILL very wavy!!! I have partially wavy hair on the underneath part of my hair but the rest is straight bc of hormone changes (my hair stylist said this is normal with multiple children) so I wanted to find an item that could compliment my other wavy hairs. This did a phenomenal job! It reaches a temperature of 210 degrees. Stayed pretty hot throughout the entire curling process. I have a LOT of hair (see my pic) and I never once had to stop and let it heat back up. I did notice if I held it a little too long, about 30-40 seconds it would make my hair smell somewhat that nasty burning smell. I want to clarify It didn't ruin my hair but just gave it that smell. So I stuck with about 20 seconds for each section and that worked great! You do have the option to turn the heat down which I'm gonna try next time just to see. Overall, 10/10 for price, product being sturdy, temp control, and curls/waves that it makes. Took me about 20 minutes to do all of my hair and again I have THICK hair!"

I was kind of doubting buying it because of all the bad reviews even though it was a little bit of money compared to other brands but I still ended up buying it. Because of the size of the barrel obviously you’re not gonna have tight curls it is a little hard to not accidentally press the buttons because they’re right there where your hand is When curling your hair. I just have to be very careful not to press the buttons there’s two options if you don’t read the instruction you might not know (I didn’t at first). There’s a turbo and there’s an on and off the turbo means it’s super hot for hair you can’t really curl that well because they’re being stubborn I wouldn’t use that one for all my hair. The temperature is easy to change. The length of the cord is fine it’s decent not that long but not extremely short were you just keep unpluging it every time. I loved how my hair turned out it was just what I wanted and it lasted the whole day with some hairspray. I have thick hair btw.,Use the Turbo setting!,"At first, I totally thought this was a piece of crap. I ordered the 1.5 inch barrel since I love the loose waves and I have mid-long length hair that I typically grow out. My hair is very fine so I originally used the 5 heat setting. It didn't do anything! So I changed it to 10 then 15 according to the box instructions for thin and normal hair. None of it worked. I thought maybe I just suck at curling hair like I have for years. I used my abandoned 0.5-1"" remington curling wand, that I'm not a fan of since it tapers down to size making really tight curls, to check if maybe my Chi thermal protection spray was interfering with the curls. It wasn't, the remington made perfect tight curls. Came back to read the reviews and some people mentioned the turbo option. I tried it one more time with it still set to 15 and the turbo option on. I'm not sure if increasing it makes turbo even hotter but it worked perfectly! The image shows the left curl which was the failed curl. The right curl is after using turbo. Hope this review helps someone! One thing I don't like about the wand is that the temp range is 1-30 rather than actual temperatures.",Just Buy It!,"I love big curls and have been wanting to get a 1.5 inch curling iron for the longest time. While my 1 inch iron still gave great curls, there are days where I wanted bouncier curls/waves. Another issue is the fact that my hair was only 2 inches past my shoulders, so maybe it's too short? My 1 inch curling iron is already great, so there shouldn't be THAT much of a difference... Right? WRONG. I had such pretty curls that my friends all complimented me and are planning on buying this for themselves as well! My curls were so bouncy that I could help but do hair flips at any given chance.","YER A WIZARD, HAIRY","Lol oh man, do I freaking SUCK at curling my hair. I don’t even know why, honestly, my stylist seems to be able to curl my hair just fine using a similar style iron with the same size barrel but I’m sure she could probably use corn on the cob and still get amazing results. I guess that’s why I pay her hella Club Penguin Coins so I can pretend to be an Instagram thot. Sometimes I have her curl my hair just so I can watch and study her hair wizardry fully aware I’m just going straight home afterwards, getting into my favourite eye-gouging, bright, neon-pink camo Snuggie™ to lay on my couch and binge-watch 90 Day Fiancé. Her skills curling my uncooperative hair had me pretty dang convinced she’d made some deal or contract with a very powerful hair demon. You ever seen Inuyasha before? She probably conjured up that same hair demon lady from the first season. Or so I had thought.. until I discovered this bad boy. I can curl my hair like nobody’s business, easy and damage-free. I didn’t even have to sell my soul to some weird anime chick with a fetish for snatching people’s hair. Idk it’s just all around great and easy to use, so much so that I’m thinking of putting up my very own hair-curling/lemonade stand, make myself a decent amount of Neopoints and maybe someday move on up to making the big Voxels. Haha.. ha yeah that’s probably a bit too ambitious for me, honestly. But uh.. yeah, best curling iron I’ve ever owned and used. Oh, and what’s best feature of all, you might ask? Heh, easy one: it’s pink.",Works perfectly.. curling irons don't burn hair people do!,So I know what you're thinking why bother buying this cheap curling iron I can tell you I have spent hundreds of dollars on expensive curling irons and flat irons and what I have came to understand is it really doesn't matter what brand you get the only thing that matters is how you protect your hair people always find it shocking when I tell them that you know what my curling iron cost $20 my flat iron maybe only cost me $60 the curling iron works amazing the only thing I cannot stand about this curling iron is the fact that the way that I position my hand my thumb is always on that turn e side that controls the heat range so there's this non stop clicking that happens because I end up sliding the Heat switch and that just irks my nerves but I have managed to really pay attention to where I place my hand and you know what my hair isn't burnt it's fine at the end of the day if you're going to get a cheap iron just make sure you have the right heat protectant and serums for your hair I literally laugh at women who sit up here and say that this burned their hair or this just fried their hair .... there's really no reason why that should be happening to anybody when you can go out and buy you a decent brand of heat protected and shield protectant for your hair it does not burn my hair my luxurious blonde wig is still smooth and silky as it was so don't feel like you need to invest in a super expensive curling iron because this definitely works it heats up super quick and that gets the job done perfectly fine

Perfect size curl. Watch a video on YouTube And leave the ends out, it makes a perfect loose beach wave. Curls are even still good on day 2 with a little dry shampoo at the root and a soft brushing. Gets very hot so be careful.",My new favorite Curling Iron,"It's just the right size for loose waves, I was a little wary because of the reviews but I bought it after seeing that this is the curling iron they use at the Habit Salon in Arizona (look them up they are famous for their extensions and hairstyles with the long loose waves). I'm so glad I did. It heats up really fast and it gets hotter than my other curling irons. I recommend starting at the lowest heat setting and going hotter slowly to see how your hair can handle it. I have blonde highlighted hair and my hair can usually take a lot of heat because it's thick but on this iron I only have to turn it to 25 out of 50 and that is more than enough heat for my hair to retain really nice curls or waves. If I would have started out at 50 right away I would have fried my hair. I once heard the saying - You cook a Pizza at 450.. you don't curl your hair at 450- I think that is totally accurate. Some people go way to high on the temps for their hair type and that's why you read these comments about how they fried their hair the first time they use a new curling iron. Definitely recommend this curling iron though. My husband only ever likes it when I straighten my hair, but now with this curling iron he prefers the loose waves I can create over the straight - which is a nice change. ;)",The 1.25 is perfect for styling beachy waves in my shoulder length hair,"My hair is a little past shoulder length and I ordered both the 1.25 and 1.5 curling irons to style loose curly waves. I think the 1.25 definitely works best to achieve this style. The 1.5 barrel was just too big and did not hold or maintain my curl throughout the day (Although if your hair is considerably longer, the 1.5 might be a better curling iron for you). I have had these curling irons for well over a year and they have held up extremely well. They are strong, good quality, durable, and work great. I would absolutely recommend them to others!",BEST CURLING IRON I’VE EVER OWNED!!!!!,Love this curling iron! I had my eye on this one for some time. I ordered from kohls and got the wrong size but didn’t want to reorder from there because the shipping wasn’t fast enough. So I found it on here. I started by reading the reviews first and seen that it had burnt off some of the ladies hair. I usually like to see for myself so I purchased it. Of course I was a little scared lol but my hair stylist suggested this curling iron and I was so anxious to try it. I started with a low temp worked my way up. I kept setting the temp higher and higher till it was as hot as it could get. I had no problems with it! It made my hair nice and smooth compared to my other curling iron and curled beautifully! It’s actually the best curling iron I have ever owned! So happy with my purchase!,TEN STARS!!!,"I give this Babyliss Pro 10 Stars!!! My Neice is a Cosmetologist and she recommended it. She has had hers for around 5 years (?) She says It will last forever. 😊👍🏽 I’m not disappointed!! My hair is thin AND FINE, and WON’T hold a curl for anything!! 😖🤦🏼‍♀️ Not anymore!! This curling iron is AMAZING! It holds my curls for a couple of days!!! Seriously, buy this now. You won’t be sorry! 😊👍🏽 I use it on either the second to the lowest setting or the next up: 7= 70 digress or 14= 140 degrees. It’s never burned my hair. Pro Tip: Do not use on WET HAIR 😉 Happy Styling!"

I only lost part of it during chemo and when it grew back in, it did not match the texture of my other hair. So needless to say, my hair can do some pretty wild things.

Here are 2 pictures that show how it worked for me, and what I started with! I had it pretty much on the hottest setting, as my hair is super thick. It seemed to work well at that temperature for me.",Great Iron,"I love this curling iron! I have shoulder length hair and normally use a straightener to get my beach waves. After seeing a beauty blogger, whose opinion I have come to trust, post about this on her website, I figured why not give it a try. I like to think of myself as curling iron challenged and can never seem to get it quite right. I always end up with spider legs no matter how many tutorials I watch. For some reason, with this one I didn't. I loved that the cord twists so it wasn't getting all wrapped up around my head and I loved that it's really long. I set it at 400 degrees as some other reviewers suggested and it worked for me. I have semi thick hair and I could probably go a little higher. I used a heat protectant on it and my curls lasted all day. I got the 1 1/4"" barrel and I thought it would be too small when I saw it, but it gave me the messy relaxed beach wave I was going for. The only downside I could see about it was that it wasn't smooth when I was sliding it down my hair. The edges of the clap made it a little difficult but it didn't affect my curl in any way. It was more about the flow of curling it. I tried wrapping my hair around the barrel, but found it was a little too loose for the look I wanted. All in all, would definitely buy this again.","You will have to pry this iron out of my cold, dead hands","I’ve been through a dozen curling irons, and this is The One.

So since I've only used this for a weekend camping trip so far, and in ideal weather, I can't answer a lot but here are my opinions on it: - How many can fit? 6 KIDS could probably fit. If you're an experienced camper then you obviously already knew this wouldn't fit 6 adults (or even teens) but I just feel the need to specify this. Realistically though if you're using camping mats that aren't larger than a sleeping and are adults you could squeeze 4 with room for bags at your feet. Cot wise I was using a Tenton Sports Adventurer so with using that as a reference I would say you could squeeze a maximum of 3 in there with no real aisle space on either side (maybe a leg width?), this is assuming you use the end point to enter and leave as well as storing underneath the cots. If you want more elbow room then I wouldn't put more than 2 in of that size, you could definitely put 2 of the XXL version of Tenton's cot as well and have space for an aisle between in which case with larger cots you could probably fit 2 couples comfortably if there aren't a million bags to deal with. - Is set up easy? As someone who has grown up camping this is pretty much your standard tent design in terms of set up. I ended up at the campsite well after dark and had a veteran camper along with a friend who doesn't tent camp often for helping me set it up to which it took us less than 5 minutes to put up. Super easy and does not require instructions if you've ever put up a tent like it before. - How is break down? Last day of the camp out I ended up having to break down the tent alone so it took me maybe more like 10 minutes but with help it shouldn't take that long at all. I even managed to get it into the bag WITH SPACE TO SPARE.... I folded in half then into 3rds and it fit without any struggle with everything rolled up in the tent. Still shocked it fit that easily after years of struggling with other tents to fit back into their bags. - Is there headroom to stand? Yes, PLENTY of head room and probably the roomiest tent I have owned to date. I'm 5'5"" and even with a small hanging light I got for the top of the tent I still had an arms reach above worth of room. Closer to the walls obviously it's a bit shorter but I did not feel the slightest bit restricted like a normal small tent has. - Is it warm? On a sunny day with it entirely closed it got a tad warm when I checked in on it but with all the ventilation it has built in already it really doesn't get scorching like some tents do if you don't have any windows open. The first night with this tent it actually got pretty chilly and the tent was assuredly not meant for colder nights, with a better sleeping bag rated for colder weather you should be fine though... mine just was very old and not great against the cold anymore. - Does it hold up to rain? I camped in sunny weather, so I cannot personally review it from experience, but I would say this is not a tent that I would knowingly take on a camping trip that will have rain. The only real reason I say this is because the back has this little vent to let air in around head level if you're sleeping on the ground which is great for summer/warm weather but as someone that has been in a flooded tent before it just seems like a horrible feature if you're going up against a storm. Some reviews claimed this wasn't a problem though so perhaps it isn't as big of an issue as it just appears to be from my perspective at least. Overall I love this tent, wish it retained heat a bit more, but definitely look forward to using it again on the next camping trip! Feel free to ask any further questions I'll try my best to keep on top of replies.","Premium quality for ""bargain basement"" price","First of all let me say that I was very sceptical when I bought this tent, I only got it because I needed it last minute and just hoped that it would last long enough for a week's worth of camping. I was happily surprised at the build quality and the ease of use, here are some pros and cons: Pros: - Easy to set up (comes with detailed instructions, but if you've ever put up a tent before you will figure it out even without those) - Includes everything you need to make it waterproof and guard against wind and mosquitoes/pests - Plenty of places to hang a light inside - More than enough room for 2 average size adults, (I'm 6' 180lbs i could have fit 3 times comfortably with an air mattress, thankfully i didn't need to but just so you are aware it's perfect for 2) - Easy to disassemble and pack (literally takes 1 person about 5 minutes to break down and pack for travel, also comes with a carrying pouch) - Last but not least the price (less than 50 dollars including expedited shipping) In the picture above you can see my friend's tent on the left, that is also a 2 person tent but cost him nearly 500 dollars and what he got for that was a tent that does pack smaller and is lighter, but fitting 2 people in it is not easy, I tried the first night lol, never again) Cons: - I had trouble actually finding one but if i had one it would be the weight, and even that i think could have been attributed to my decision to get a 2 person rather than a 1. it is heavier than a more expensive tent and you will feel it if you are backpacking, which we were). - One more con, the pouch, nothing wrong with having one but once you unpack the tent good luck getting it back into the included pouch, a good idea, however poorly executed Bottom line; if you are looking for a cheap but durable and backpackable tent this is the one, although if you are thinking of saving weight I'd suggest a 1 person, this one will give you a good workout though and I was fine :) (we were backpacking on Isle Royale btw for 4 days so I packed and unpacked and set this up every time we stopped to camp, and had no issues, fantastic build quality for the price and well worth it in my opinion.","Waterproof, Inexpensive, Fast Set Up, and Light-Weight (2-Man Tent)","Good gosh folks! I bought this 2-man tent due to the low price and the high scoring reviews here at Amazon and the reviews are spot on. I had my eye on quite a few other tents at $125 to $250 but I have to say this one caught my eye early on because of the reviews. I said: ""wtf? Order it and see how it performs and if it was all a big lie then I'm out a measly $38!"" NOTE: On the advice of lots of folks here I purchased a small 2 oz bottle of ""Coleman Seam Sealer"" (available here or at Wal-Mart). The day the tent arrived I set it up outside on my back deck and sealed all the seams and let it dry for about 4 hours before folding it back up and putting it away. PROS: This tent is inexpensive, light weight, easy to erect, and does it's job quite well. It assembles in about 3 to 5 minutes (if you've done it once or twice). The instructions are a perfect guide if you cannot remember the 3 easy steps. CAMPING IN THE RAIN: So I went on my first camping trip with it this past weekend and I was caught in an off-and-on torrential downpour from 10 PM at night through 9 AM the next morning and guess what? I stayed completely dry and slept very well. I did forget to zip the small electrical cord opening shut for the first few hours and the sideways rain got a few drops in there until I realized it and zipped it tight. I left the vent windows open during the entire storm and had zero issues with water. TIP: Be sure to bring a couple of large black trash bags to put the tent into if you have to break camp while it is still raining. That prevented a huge wet mess inside the car when I departed the camp site. Time will tell if this is a durable product ... but so far so good. LIKE!",Great Family Tent for Car camping,"The key to loving the Coleman Sundome 4 person tent is to understand what you are buying. For around $60.00 you are getting a great tent used for the occasional weekend camping trips with your kids or family. I purchased 3 of these tents to use for backyard campouts/sleepouts that my kids want to have with their friends. For the price, they are great for that. I will also use one of the tents with my son for weekend Cub Scout campouts. Again, this is the perfect tent to use during a summer/fall weekend campouts where you are not carrying the tent a long distance. What this tent is NOT is a backpacking tent or a tent to be used often or in very cold weather. I have a Kelty Trail Ridge 3 tent that I use for backpacking or when the weather is supposed to be under 40 degrees F overnight. It has better poles, is lighter and much smaller (making it about half the weight of the Coleman Sundome 4). Again, this tent is not perfect for all activities. The fiberglass poles are not suited for heavy winds or very frequent use. The Rain-fly only covers the top half of the tent meaning in a heavy rain/wind, you are likely to get wet. The stakes are the cheap tin one that bend after only a few uses. So if you intention is to campout for several weeks at a time or go backpacking, look elsewhere. But for 60 bucks, this tent is a great value for the accessional family campout for a long weekend. A few other notes: - This is the same 3-pole Dome tent that Coleman has been making for a long time. However this Sundome 4 has a few revision I like. The rainfly has 2 sets of Velcro attachments that connect it to each of the main tent cross poles. In previous version there was only one attachment per side. - Also, this version has a small loop in the center of the tent to allow you to hang a small light. I recommend this one as a cheap and lightweight tent light ( ) - Lastly this version has a small ground vent that allows air to come in from the bottom of the tent to help reduce condensation. Also, there is a small zippered section in the front left corner that would allow you to bring an extension cord into the tent away from the door (where it is a tripping hazard). If you need a tent to use during the warm nights and for 2-4 days at a time, this is a great inexpensive option.",Perfect for me and my dog!,"I'm not a know-it-all camper or anything like that. I just like to go a few times every summer and get away with my dog. This tent is perfect! I live in Oregon, so you can never be 100% certain when it will rain. Ever since I woke up in a puddle in an old tent, I make sure to only buy tents with this ""bathtub"" design. I just got this tent and set it up by myself in my living room and it took me probably less than 10 minutes. There was definitely enough room for 2 people. However, whoever sleeps on the inside/backside of the tent (next to the window) will definitely struggle to get out of the tent without waking/bothering the other person. This is an awesome tent though and I can't wait to try it soon! Also, I was able to repackage this tent back into it's carry bag with ease! There was no struggle at all! In fact, there's still enough room that I can toss a small hammer in for the tent stakes, and a small brush to dust off the tent before packing. However, the bag is expandable if you need more room to carry stuff. Just remove the tag/band on the bottom of the bag, and you'll have more storage room--which is genius in my opinion. Especially after I've really had to stuff some tents to get them back in their bags (barely)!"

I just bring in my laptop. I can't vouch for the water resistance, since it wasn't raining when we used it (so far just once) but here's my experience: I unpacked it. The directions were pretty easy. I'm sure I'll put it together in half the time in the future since I now know how to do it, but it literally only took me about 10 minutes, and that was with stopping a lot to read the instructions. I think the rain cover was actually more difficult for me to figure out and took longer to install than the actual tent, but now I know how to do it. This tent can be put up with rain cover in 5 minutes once you know what you're doing. It's VERY lightweight, comes in a small carry bag. Since we only used it on the deck, we didn't need to use the stakes for tying it down, but they are included. It's is sturdy enough for what we're using it for and appears to be well made. There was plenty of room inside for us to relax on a pile of pillows in front of the laptop with 2 small dogs and snacks. We carried it indoors without taking it apart, because with a person on each end, you can ""fold"" the tent flat bringing the poles together. If you wanted to use it on the ground, I'd probably recommend a tarp because any sharp sticks or rocks may rip the material, plus you'd feel them. The bottom of the tent is very thin, made of the same material as the rest of the tent. Over all, we love it, it's easy, light weight, easily transported, even carried while assembled, has a removable rain cover so you can enjoy the stars on a clear night. Well worth the price. I'm happy with it. UPDATE: I put the tent on the back deck again for another movie night ""campout"" with my daughter. I left it there overnight to continue the next day. I got up in the morning and it was gone. It was VERY windy, and I didn't have it tied down, so it turns out it blew away. It crossed my yard, flew over my fence, tumbled across the street, around a huge tree, past three more properties and over another chain link fence where I found it in someone's back yard. The rope had caught on the fence and stopped it from going further, so I was able to fish it back over the fence. I carried it back home on my back, wind still blowing hard, filling the still erected tent with air like a kite, and nearly carrying me away with it. I'm a little embarrassed to think neighbors might have saw me, a middle aged woman carrying a fully erected tent on my back, turning me into a human kite on a windy day. I put it back on my deck, this time tying it down, and wouldn't you know it, it didn't even have a single rip in it. Still in PERFECT condition after the ordeal it went through! I love this tent.",Its a good three seasons tent,"I'm a 6ft1 dude and 200+lbs so I don't really fit in tents. Lugging tents around has never been a problem, but I can appreciate it when a good tent comes along. So is this good? The answer is yes. This tent isn't the lightest tent, but its lighter than similar tents at the big box stores or the blue store. The tent manages this by having thinner shock rods. The tent stills sets up solid though, and it did well when I set it up in the back yard when it was pretty gusty with 15mph winds yesterday. Good! The tent is a three seasons tent. The top half is mosquito netting, but we don't have bugs this time of year so I can't really test that out. The door is the normal door-and-screen job. The tent does have two windows in the back, but it does not have a second door. If you want two doors for your two person tents, you want another tent. The people in the tent sleep N/S and the door and window are E/W, so someone has to climb over someone else for late night bathroom breaks. On the other hand, this tent is super comfy sleeping one person, and it's light enough to carry like that. I generally like tents which have two doors but it's personal preference. The guy lines are also reflective on mine, which is great, because I got it to go scout camping. People won't trip over them in the night. The rainfly is also good, it's made of a different material than the tent and it's very waterproof from me leaving it up overnight. Lots and lots of venting which is good even with the windows shut. Water in the tent makes it heavy and makes gear not be warm, so getting the condensation out of the tent is super important. I'm really happy with it, we'll see if it survives boyscouts this year.",Look no further: this is the best camping tent,"When I received this tent in the mail it was in the tiniest bag. I was immediately skeptical and thought it would be too small, but once I began assembling it, it came to its true size. I could not be more satisfied with my purchase. The tent was incredibly easy to assemble, with instructions attached to the bag so you never lose them. Every piece came in it’s own little bag inside the bigger bag, which is a + for organization. There are two “windows” on each side of the tent that open and close from the inside. The bottom is made of tarp material to avoid water inside the tent. A rainproof cover is included for a rainy day. My siblings and I are very excited to go on many camping trips this year.",Pleasantly surprised with this tent. Great value.,"This was my first tent (and camping experience) and it went better than expected. The tent was very easy to assemble and the instructions are stitched into the packing bag so you never lose them (although after the first time assembling it you pretty much know how to do it again without the instructions). The space was perfect for our family of four, two adults and two kids. We had to install the rain cover because it was showing to rain and the tent protected us from water. It was pretty windy out, but the tent was solid. I liked that it had ventilation from two sides so the air could flow across the inside of the tent keeping the air inside fresh. A nice surprise was the little see-through pouch hanging from the inside of the tent which I assumed were for shoes, but we used it to put our cell phones in. All in all I would recommend this tent.",Great value!,"This is tent is perfect for our needs, especially at the cost. I didn't want to spend too much money since this tent will only be used in a lean-to (we're allowed tents in lean-tos where we're going but check your local rules) to keep mosquitos and other bugs out in bug country. I'm 5'2 and my husband is 5'11 and we both fit perfectly in this tent. Enough space for us in our two person sleeping bag. The tent was VERY easy to assemble, with the instructions in the bag that it came with. Setting it up for the first time took around 15 minutes but now that we know how it works, I assume that when we put it to actual use, it'll only take less than 10 minutes to set it up. Disassembling it was even easier, taking less than 5 minutes for only one person. It's not an ultralight tent for backpacking/backcountry but it is lightweight enough to carry through a campground. I can't attest to how waterproof it is because I don't intend to use this outside of a lean-to. Can't wait to use it in 2 weeks! EDIT: Used it during our camping trip. Worked perfectly for our needs. Added a pic. Roomy enough for me and my husband (5'2 and 5'11). Love the internal compartment inside for small things like a flashlight. I'm in love with the color."

When it?s time to pack up, the camping tent stores away in the included expandable carry bag that lets you tear away the rip strip for easy packing. Amazon.com Nothing kills a campsite buzz like a tent with too many poles and too little instruction. Enter the Coleman Instant Tent 4, a four-person tent that sets up in less than a minute. The tent is made using an innovative one-piece design, with poles that come pre-attached to the tent. That means there's no frustrating assembly and no parts to lose. Simply unfold the tent, spread out the fabric, extend the poles, and click and lock. The only thing easier is rolling out your bag and sleeping in the open.Made of heavy-duty 150D polyester taffeta, the Instant Tent 4 is every bit as sturdy as its traditional counterparts. The tent is outfitted with Coleman's exclusive WeatherTec system, a series of technical features intended to protect you from inclement weather and nasty storms. WeatherTec tents are built with a coated polyester fabric combined with anti-wicking thread, webbing, and zippers, all designed to keep you dry when the rain comes down. The tent's welded waterproof floor and inverted floor seams, meanwhile, dramatically increase the water resistance by hiding the needle holes inside the tent and away from the elements.The tent is also fully taped, eliminating the need for a separate rainfly. Add in a strong, wind-responsive frame and you have a shelter that performs like a brick house during a storm. In fact, Coleman is so confident in its WeatherTec system that it exposes its WeatherTec tents to a rain room that simulates nasty downpours, and to a wind machine capable of blowing hurricane force gusts. The results? Even after the tests, Coleman guarantees its WeatherTec tents will keep you dry. The 4-Person Instant Tent, which sleeps up to four people in its 8-by-7-foot footprint, stands 59 inches tall in the center and includes room for one queen airbed. The tent weighs 35.55 pounds and carries a limited one-year manufacturer's warranty. Coleman Instant Tent Buying GuideInstant Tents can be set up or taken down in less than one minuteAbout Coleman More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a ""no light, no pay"" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded",Weatherproof: Welded corners and inverted seams keep water from getting in; Integrated rainfly offers extra weather protection with better airflow | Built to last: Double-thick fabric stands up to the elements season after season | Instant setup: In as fast as 1 minute | Roomy interior: 8 x 7 feet with 4 feet 11 inch center height; Fits 1 queen-size air bed | 1-year limited warranty,5.90E+01,96,18,84,tents,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41WcTeaGPoL.jpg,Coleman,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41WcTeaGPoL._SL160_.jpg,B07GX54QFL,Sports,TENT,,Coleman,4-Person,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41WcTeaGPoL._SS125_.jpg,Tents,"Coleman Cabin Tent with Instant Setup | Cabin Tent for Camping Sets Up in 60 Seconds, 4-Person",1,4.5,4376,,B004E4AVY8,22027,153146,,,,,,Comfy car camping cabin,"It's comfortable for a full size plus a twin sized air mattress. It sets up and takes down very easily - sets up in less than two minutes with one person, and less than five minutes to get it stuffed into the carrying bag. It fits in my subcompact car. It stayed dry through 5 straight hours of heavy rain. Too heavy to hike any real distance with, but excellent for car camping with kids.",T‘Was a dark and windy night.,"Very happy with this tent so far. I haven’t been able to set it up and use it in rainy weather yet, so I’ll have to report back later on weatherproofing. This tent set up just as quickly and easily as my previous instant tent did. It takes a little getting used to the “solid/hinged door”, as it relies on a pole system on the outer rim that zips up in the door. Once figured out, all was good, but it sucks having a second zipper running along the outer edge of the door, as this can get confusing as myself and one other person already mistook it during first use as a regular zipper to open the door. PRO: because of the dark nature of this tent, it seems to be a thicker material and did a good job cutting down wind on a breezy and chilly night. Something not advertised in the ability of this tent. To say that it cut down on the amount of light coming in would be an understatement. There’s nearly no light let in and most of it that does come in comes through a zipper or two that you haven’t fully met up on the doors or windows. I will keep this updated once I get a full season out of this tent! Hopefully!",This Is An Awesome Tent That I Highly Recommend!,"Tents come in many shapes and sizes, each have their positives, and their negatives. Some tents are cheap, while other's, really expensive. The best tent for you, is going to depend on what you need from a tent, and how much money you are willing to spend. Most people who like to camp in the summer time, will probably be satisfied with a tent like this one. While other's who camp in extreme cold temperatures, might be inclined to go with one of those super thermal padded tents. PACKAGING: Coleman loves to double pack these tents. When you receive your package, and open it up, it reveals the Coleman bag as seen in photo 1. If you unzip the Coleman bag, it reveals another box! Once you open up that box, finally, you will be able to pull your tent out of the box to begin deploying. DIMENSIONS: The dimensions of the tent are, 10 feet long, by 9 feet wide, and 6 feet tall. I chose a tent this big because I wanted enough space. However, they always overstate a tents capacity. It may fit up to 6 small children. But in reality, this tent can only house up to 4-adults, and up to 2-adults comfortably. PITCHING: Pitching the tent, is not as quick as the company says, which should be no surprise to no one. If you had 2-people working together, you could perhaps do it in 60-seconds. However, I pitched it all by myself, and it took closer to 2-minutes. When you compare this design to a dome tent however, you will take much longer to set one of those up. All you have to do, is stand the spider column (as I call it) upright, then unfold each leg, until the tent is flat on the ground. Then begin extending each leg of the tent, until the button snaps through the slots. Again, it will be a bit cumbersome for 1-person to do, however, still faster then setting up a dome tent. Once the tent is pitched, and you've stretched all the legs outward, then begin setting up your guidelines. If your tent is on earth, you can use the included stakes they give you, to stake the tent down using the guidelines. Additionally, if you plan to camp on days where it will be raining, you really need to waterproof the tent with the optional rainfly accessory, model 2000010331. The rainfly is nearly impossible to put on, via 1-person, once the tent has been pitched up. I recommend 2-people to install the rainfly. The rainfly secures to the tent via plastic C-clips. And the rainfly comes with its own stakes and guidelines, to secure to the earth. INGRESS: The tent has only 1-entry point, the front door. And unlike most tents, which the door spans the entire front half of the tent, this tent's door, only opens 1/2 of the front opening. I would have liked to have seen the full width being used. There are instant popup tents that are larger in size, that do use full width doors. As typical with all tents, it is double zippered, so you can close and open it from within. WINDOWS: This tent is fully loaded when it comes to windows! There is literally windows on every side of this tent, all of them have 2-zippers per window. Each window has a mesh screen to keep bugs out, and each can be rolled down and secured with the knobs they provide. The reason they didn't use the full width for the door, is because they wanted to put a window next to the door as well. So rest assured, if your camping in the summer time, you are going to get plenty of ventilation. VENTS: Now this is where I can be a bit nit picky when it comes to vent locations. On larger tents, they often put the vents close to the bottom of the tents, usually located in the back, or on the sides of the tent. But they chose to put the vents on the top of the tent on this model. I guess if your camping in the summer time, since heat rises, having them on the top makes sense. But if your camping in the winter time, its only going to let all the heat out. And if your running propane heaters, such as the buddy heater, you really want it to intake air from the bottom of your tent. Also, if you close the vents, there is still no way to make them seal in their closed position, so they will still vent when you don't want them to. The vents also come with zipper meshes, as well as the velcro strap that keeps them open. MATERIAL: The materials that this tent consist of, 150D Polyester, and Taffeta 150D. They use taped seams, inverted welded seams, and use rugged polyguard. I'm not an expert on tents, so I can't tell you the values of these materials, or how they are constructed. What I can tell you, is that no integrated weathertek system is going to completely waterproof the tent without the rainfly accessory. However, for a super light sprinkle, you can get away with it. For the most part, this tent feels like quality to me. A lot of times, companies will cheap out on the zippers, but these ones seem pretty good. The material makeup of the tent seems fairly solid, and the aluminum legs also seem pretty good. The spider column was fairly easy to work with when setting up the tent, so I think it is durable enough as well. Do I think the materials would hold up in winds up to 50MPH or more? No, absolutely not! But who's camping in stormy winds? ACCESSORIES: The tent comes with several accessory points that I like. Outside the tent above the door, there is a loop where you can hang a lantern, mosquito repellent, etc. Inside the tent are two mesh pockets, one close to the door on the side of the tent, and the other on the back half of the tent, on the other side. These mesh pockets can be used to store cell phones, keys, lighters, emergency supplies, pretty much anything you need small pockets for. The tent also comes equipped with a lantern hanger. But if your lantern only has a handle instead of a hook, you will need to use a carabeener to attach to the lantern hanger. EXPERIENCE: Most of you are going to use a tent to go camping. While I would love to go camping personally, I no longer have a vehicle, so I have no access to camping sites. Instead, I am thinking outside the box, and solving a problem I have. I lease my workshop, therefor I do not own the building. When you are leasing, its illegal for the renter to make changes to the building, its up to the person who owns the building to do that. The sheet metal roof of my workshop leaks when it rains. When it snows heavy, snow also falls in from the ridge cap. And since my shop is not insulated, it gets mighty cold in there during the winter time, there is just no way to heat it. NOTE: Absent T land owners are not fun. They don't consider you important, and they refuse to fix problems. But they love to go numerous vacations every year all over the world, with the money they make from your rent payments. Capitalism at work fellas. To solve this issue, I bought this tent, I knew that it would solve two problems for me. First, keep the rain off of my most important machines, and provide heat to keep the freezing cold at bay. Also, I wanted a space where I could do work in warmer temps. As you can see from the pictures, the tent fits the available space I have in the shop quite well. I ran an electrical cord up through the top vent, so that I can have power to run a light, space heater, and a charger. I used a 32-WATT LED worklight as my light source, I just used a small bungee cord wrapped around the light's frame several times, then put both the hooks onto the lantern hanger attachment. While it may be crude, it works, and thats all that counts. I run the space heater on low, its set to 65 degrees F, and it oscillates to move the heat around. When I am not working in the tent, I store my 2-best mowers inside, and a scooter. The mower closest to the camera, I actually bought on Amazon! I use an outdoor wireless thermometer to monitor the temp inside the tent, thats how I dialed in the heater. Also, to protect the tent floor from tearing, as I am moving heavy equipment in and out of it, I chose to line the floor with cardboard, and taped the cardboard together. And since I unfortunately do not have carpet material, I chose to just staple some blankets to the cardboard. If anybody has any knowledge on where I can get carpet to line this square footage on the cheap, please let me know. When the temperature is in the 30's, I am able to maintain 54 degrees F with the heater on low. (750-WATTS) When the temperature is in the 40's, I am able to maintain 60 degrees F. If I through the heater on high, (1500-WATTS) I could easily hit the mark of 65 degrees F while its in the 30's out there. But I don't want to use that much power on my bill, so I chose not to. For those of you who plan to use a propane buddy heater, make sure your vent is open, otherwise you will burn up all your oxygen and become asphyxiated. A propane heater generally puts out more BTU's of heating power, but at a price of consuming propane. CONCLUSION: I am known to do things in unique ways, and this tent is no exception. While this tent is a very simple solution to a larger problem, it is both cost effective, ingenuitive, and it just works for me. Nobody can wait on absent t owners to handle things. And there was no way I was going to spend 1000 dollars of my own money to insulate the workshop and fix the roof leaks. I really love my tent, it works really well, and I think you will love it too, if you choose to buy it. Despite a few of my nit picks, I am going to give this a solid 5 out of 5 stars!",HIGHLY recommend. Read below,I cannot recommend this 4 person cabin more. Its not to be used backpacking only out of vehicle camping. My gf and I set this up in no time. Make sure to purchase the rain fly and tent kit for the mallet and upgraded steaks. Held up to a thunderstorm all weekend in grand canyon the very first time we used it. Fit a queen bed with about 2.5 feet of free space left on the entrance door side. I even put big coals in my solo stove and and the tent was 70+ while it was around 30 outside at night. Ventilation was great even in the rain with the fly. highly recommended for expedition vehicles i will surely have this for years.,Best Tent Ever,"Best Tent Ever. My husband and I set up the tent in under a minute. Either of us could have set it up alone. We used this tent without the rainfly (sold separately) in 30 degree temperature. It was cold and the interior walls were damp with condensation, but tolerable. The windows on all sides are great. We fit our two double high full size air mattresses inside with room for bags and etc. Would fit a toddler air mattress in between our two with still room at our feet for bags. We added a small tarp by the opening to make a porch for wiping shoes before entering. The zippers are good quality and easy to open. I'm 5'9"" and can stand up all the way inside. My husband is 6'2"" and can mostly stand up."

All in all I would recommend this tent.",Its a good three seasons tent,"I'm a 6ft1 dude and 200+lbs so I don't really fit in tents. Lugging tents around has never been a problem, but I can appreciate it when a good tent comes along. So is this good? The answer is yes. This tent isn't the lightest tent, but its lighter than similar tents at the big box stores or the blue store. The tent manages this by having thinner shock rods. The tent stills sets up solid though, and it did well when I set it up in the back yard when it was pretty gusty with 15mph winds yesterday. Good! The tent is a three seasons tent. The top half is mosquito netting, but we don't have bugs this time of year so I can't really test that out. The door is the normal door-and-screen job. The tent does have two windows in the back, but it does not have a second door. If you want two doors for your two person tents, you want another tent. The people in the tent sleep N/S and the door and window are E/W, so someone has to climb over someone else for late night bathroom breaks. On the other hand, this tent is super comfy sleeping one person, and it's light enough to carry like that. I generally like tents which have two doors but it's personal preference. The guy lines are also reflective on mine, which is great, because I got it to go scout camping. People won't trip over them in the night. The rainfly is also good, it's made of a different material than the tent and it's very waterproof from me leaving it up overnight. Lots and lots of venting which is good even with the windows shut. Water in the tent makes it heavy and makes gear not be warm, so getting the condensation out of the tent is super important.

Material, colour, quite as lot is a promised and expected. Bought tents for my family camping vacation in the wilderness. Tent has 2 windows. one on the back and a few on the front in the door. Both windows can be closed with an additional zip. Zipper are also good quality. Nets on the inside of the tent that allow further ventilation when the windows are closed. There is also floor ventilation on the back of the tent and ground tarpaulin is a good quality. Love this types of tents because quick and easy to assemble and disassemble. Building up the tent is really easy. Also for me as a woman! Simply remove the clips during dismantling, then open the ribbon and the inside collapses cleanly. A strong rod is attached to the roof tarpaulin in 2 eyelets and fixed in the middle with a ribbon. All in all, tent is sewn clean, nothing sticks out and the seams are sealed with a transparent tape on the inside. So it can't get wet from rain inside. There is also a nice tote bag for the tent that can be pulled tight with a zipper and 2 quick clip tapes. I am very satisfied with the tent.",I recommend this 100% i loved mine,"I literally loved it, first thing that I loved the most it’s that it comes in a really small bag which makes it really comfortable to carry it, it’s not heavy at all , i got my campaign tent 6 people size the mattress that you can see on the picture it’s full just in case it helps for someone to know that, and it let me some space inside which I loved as well , i assembled it once I received at home just to have an idea in the camping place it took me literally 10 min so 5 stars on that as well super easy to assemble, i went to ginnie springs Florida and it rained the second night I stayed there it was great since this was my first time camping and I could make sure that was waterproof and it is !!! I absolutely recommend this product and this brand i love my little cute tent.. hope my review helps someone else to get what they need",Perfect for our purposes.,"I bought this tent only to use for late night girls' night ""campouts"" on the back deck with my teen daughter to watch movies and have snacks, without being eaten alive by mosquitos. I just bring in my laptop. I can't vouch for the water resistance, since it wasn't raining when we used it (so far just once) but here's my experience: I unpacked it. The directions were pretty easy. I'm sure I'll put it together in half the time in the future since I now know how to do it, but it literally only took me about 10 minutes, and that was with stopping a lot to read the instructions. I think the rain cover was actually more difficult for me to figure out and took longer to install than the actual tent, but now I know how to do it. This tent can be put up with rain cover in 5 minutes once you know what you're doing. It's VERY lightweight, comes in a small carry bag. Since we only used it on the deck, we didn't need to use the stakes for tying it down, but they are included. It's is sturdy enough for what we're using it for and appears to be well made. There was plenty of room inside for us to relax on a pile of pillows in front of the laptop with 2 small dogs and snacks. We carried it indoors without taking it apart, because with a person on each end, you can ""fold"" the tent flat bringing the poles together. If you wanted to use it on the ground, I'd probably recommend a tarp because any sharp sticks or rocks may rip the material, plus you'd feel them. The bottom of the tent is very thin, made of the same material as the rest of the tent. Over all, we love it, it's easy, light weight, easily transported, even carried while assembled, has a removable rain cover so you can enjoy the stars on a clear night. Well worth the price. I'm happy with it. UPDATE: I put the tent on the back deck again for another movie night ""campout"" with my daughter. I left it there overnight to continue the next day. I got up in the morning and it was gone. It was VERY windy, and I didn't have it tied down, so it turns out it blew away. It crossed my yard, flew over my fence, tumbled across the street, around a huge tree, past three more properties and over another chain link fence where I found it in someone's back yard. The rope had caught on the fence and stopped it from going further, so I was able to fish it back over the fence. I carried it back home on my back, wind still blowing hard, filling the still erected tent with air like a kite, and nearly carrying me away with it. I'm a little embarrassed to think neighbors might have saw me, a middle aged woman carrying a fully erected tent on my back, turning me into a human kite on a windy day. I put it back on my deck, this time tying it down, and wouldn't you know it, it didn't even have a single rip in it. Still in PERFECT condition after the ordeal it went through! I love this tent."

Review of 6 person tent,"The media could not be loaded. Absolutely in love with this tent!!! Size: the 6 person tent fit a queen size air mattress with several feet on either side. Very large inside. We are able to walk around in it easily. There are usually just 2 of us camping in it, but we still enjoy the size to be able to walk around, get changed, and stand up. Our previous 4 person tent did not allow for as much comfort. Weather proof: this tent was used during several thunderstorms and not a single drop of water got in. Very impressed with this Darkroom: absolutely amazing. The darkroom is the BEST part about this tent! It keeps the tent dark and cool in the morning. In our other tents, it would become extremely hot and bright by 6am. This tent allows you to sleep in just because you won’t be woken up right when the sun comes up (unless you open window). Love how dark and cool it remains throughout the day. I attached a photo of how dark it remains even at 2pm. Sturdiness & setup: the tent seems to be made of high quality materials and we feel very confident in the integrity of the tent. Feels very well constructed. Setup is just as simple as any other comparable tent. Nothing difficult. Overall: highly recommend, and I do recommend spending the extra few dollars for the DarkRoom. TOTALLY WORTH IT!!",Roomy with a View!,"We have taken this tent out twice since purchasing it. It proved worthy of my list of camping staples while setting it up. If you are weighing the pros and cons, consider the following: PRO: 1. It is an incredibly easy and fast tent to pitch. There are hooks that snap onto the poles; the second camping trip we had it up (including rainfly) in 3-4 minutes. 2. The porch area is PERFECT for dogs and gear... i have two large dogs... but i bet i could fit 2-3 more in the porch area. 3. I'm 5'6"" and I can fully stand up in the center of the tent. 4. Great ventilation if you want it, otherwise it does stay cooler inside that outside in desert environments (humidity is a different animal all together). 5. Without the rainfly half of the back wall is completely mesh and helps move air around even if you have the door and windows closed. 6. Fits two large dogs and a queen sized air mattress inside CONS: 1. For some one used to lightweight everything, this 6 person tent weighs 19-20lbs... so it's definitely for car camping. 2. That back wall mesh adds a draft that during the colder seasons might make your head cold if you align your sleeping pad/mattress along it - i recommend using the opposite side with the door. 3. The bag it comes in is kind of flimsy (i'm reaching to come up with a 3rd con).",Very cool looking!,"This is the 4-person dark room version. It is very cool looking and can be set up/taken down by one person relatively easily. It really does fit back into its bag (with a little squishing effort), along with all the parts. The materials are typical quality for a tent at this price point. Expect to seal the seams if you use in wet environment. The corner zippered opening for a power cord was one of the selling features for me, but if nothing else gets seam-sealed, THIS spot should. Everyone who has mentioned this feature has said it leaks in the rain. Caveat emptor. Also, the vent pictured on the bottom rear for some versions is not present in the dark room version. Some have complained about that vent being a source for water getting into tent; others like the air it provides. YMMV. But if you like it really dark when you sleep, this is the tent for you. The walls and underside of the rainfly are very opaque, and the rainfly extends a tad lower on this model than the other ones--another selling point for me. Should you sleep with the rainfly off, it's very open and airy, but when buttoned up, it's extremely dark. I should mention that below where the tent wall and the bathtub-type floor meet, the flooring material that curves up is not as light occluding as the other material. So, in the day time, there's a band of light around the bottom (see picture). Could be a potential future modification with duct tape, but air mattress(es) would likely cover most of that. However, that raises another issue. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is NOT a tent for 4 people. Only 2 adults max, and they would have to be pretty friendly. In the picture of the inside, there's a 3X6 foot pad on the floor that takes up a bit less than half the 9X7 foot floor space. Another pad/air mattress will fit with a bit of room in between them, but whoever is sleeping on the right side will be partially blocking the zipper for the D-door. So, you cannot fit 2 high air mattresses or cot beds and still have access to the door. You'll also be touching the tent walls while lying down this way on any pad or mattress higher than about 4-6 inches. A solo camper or a couple could put their *one* larger bed sideways and still fit in the tent, but for a couple, the person sleeping on the back side will likely disturb their partner to get out of tent. For these reasons, for 2 adults the 6-person or larger tent is probably a better option. This handy 106"" X 83"" footprint tarp is the best fit for a ground cloth for the 4-person tent (which should not extend beyond the edges of your tent--a common camper mistake): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JGC66XL/ref=asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1 It even comes in its own stuff sack, which you can stuff into the tent bag. UPDATE: Have now camped out in this tent, and the very first night it rained off and on all night. Not a drop in the tent, though, even with a power cord coming through the zippered access point for it (albeit, with it zipped snugly against the cord, not left wide open). The tent fabric is also so dark that you can hardly see a lamp on inside the tent from outside. The privacy that affords is appreciated. Update #2 (7/2019): Have camped out in this tent several times now and it continues to perform well. It does flex a lot under windy conditions, but it held up fine. Make sure you properly stake out ALL the guy lines. One odd thing we noticed was that the lime-green rainfly seemed to attract a lot of small flying bugs! They just hung out on it, but did not get into tent, so no big deal.",Changed the way I camp,"Do you hate camping because no matter how hard you try you can't sleep well once the sun comes up? What's that? You do? Then buy this tent. I camp upwards of 20 times per year and the most annoying thing about camping for me is I can never get good sleep past sunrise. I bought this tent in hopes to solve that and it does just that. The first time I camped in it I slept sound until about 8 in the morning. It blocks out a lot of light and for that I love it. Edit: I wanted to revise my review to state that I cannot attest to how watertight this tent is. I live in Oregon and it rains quite heavily here for a better part of the year, therefore I've always used tarps. Some of the storms here are quite substantial so I've never been one to test my tent's capabilities when it comes to water.",Great little tent,"Great little tent...with a few modifications. The poles are impossible to tell apart unless you lay them fully extended side by side. So mark them with nail polish or paint. If you spend 5 minutes with a piece of cheap plastic and some binder clips you can cover the screen room in a rain storm. Clip the edge of the plastic to the rainfly and roll it up out of the way. If rain is expected, unroll a bit and clip to the front arch pole with some slack so you don't pull on the rain fly itself. You need large 2""-3"" binder clips to reach around the pole's diameter. Then spread out the plastic and attach it with medium or small binder clips to the existing ropes or the tent or spare pegs or anywhere else that makes sense. I think the people who are annoyed by the lack of privacy when the rainfly is off can fix that with a piece of cloth and a few clips. Or a folded up rainfly and a few clips. Use clips to attach something to cover the electric cord holes. I have never seen binder clips from an office supply store used by other campers. Take some with you next time and uses will pop up all over. The black ones seem to disappear when I drop them so I just ordered some pastel ones."

I had never heard of MOON LENCE as a brand but I have only ever bought one other tent in the past. For my family of 4, this is extremely roomy (I got the 6 person). There is also plenty of space for 2 more family members or friends. It's also really great looking. I wasn't completely sure before getting it, but I think it looks great. I would definitely recommend the brand and this tent because it may be lesser known than Coleman but it's more affordable too!",Great value!,"This is tent is perfect for our needs, especially at the cost. I didn't want to spend too much money since this tent will only be used in a lean-to (we're allowed tents in lean-tos where we're going but check your local rules) to keep mosquitos and other bugs out in bug country. I'm 5'2 and my husband is 5'11 and we both fit perfectly in this tent. Enough space for us in our two person sleeping bag. The tent was VERY easy to assemble, with the instructions in the bag that it came with. Setting it up for the first time took around 15 minutes but now that we know how it works, I assume that when we put it to actual use, it'll only take less than 10 minutes to set it up. Disassembling it was even easier, taking less than 5 minutes for only one person. It's not an ultralight tent for backpacking/backcountry but it is lightweight enough to carry through a campground. I can't attest to how waterproof it is because I don't intend to use this outside of a lean-to. Can't wait to use it in 2 weeks! EDIT: Used it during our camping trip. Worked perfectly for our needs. Added a pic. Roomy enough for me and my husband (5'2 and 5'11). Love the internal compartment inside for small things like a flashlight. I'm in love with the color.",Perfect for our purposes.,"I bought this tent only to use for late night girls' night ""campouts"" on the back deck with my teen daughter to watch movies and have snacks, without being eaten alive by mosquitos. I just bring in my laptop. I can't vouch for the water resistance, since it wasn't raining when we used it (so far just once) but here's my experience: I unpacked it. The directions were pretty easy. I'm sure I'll put it together in half the time in the future since I now know how to do it, but it literally only took me about 10 minutes, and that was with stopping a lot to read the instructions. I think the rain cover was actually more difficult for me to figure out and took longer to install than the actual tent, but now I know how to do it. This tent can be put up with rain cover in 5 minutes once you know what you're doing. It's VERY lightweight, comes in a small carry bag. Since we only used it on the deck, we didn't need to use the stakes for tying it down, but they are included. It's is sturdy enough for what we're using it for and appears to be well made. There was plenty of room inside for us to relax on a pile of pillows in front of the laptop with 2 small dogs and snacks. We carried it indoors without taking it apart, because with a person on each end, you can ""fold"" the tent flat bringing the poles together. If you wanted to use it on the ground, I'd probably recommend a tarp because any sharp sticks or rocks may rip the material, plus you'd feel them. The bottom of the tent is very thin, made of the same material as the rest of the tent. Over all, we love it, it's easy, light weight, easily transported, even carried while assembled, has a removable rain cover so you can enjoy the stars on a clear night. Well worth the price. I'm happy with it. UPDATE: I put the tent on the back deck again for another movie night ""campout"" with my daughter. I left it there overnight to continue the next day. I got up in the morning and it was gone. It was VERY windy, and I didn't have it tied down, so it turns out it blew away. It crossed my yard, flew over my fence, tumbled across the street, around a huge tree, past three more properties and over another chain link fence where I found it in someone's back yard. The rope had caught on the fence and stopped it from going further, so I was able to fish it back over the fence. I carried it back home on my back, wind still blowing hard, filling the still erected tent with air like a kite, and nearly carrying me away with it. I'm a little embarrassed to think neighbors might have saw me, a middle aged woman carrying a fully erected tent on my back, turning me into a human kite on a windy day. I put it back on my deck, this time tying it down, and wouldn't you know it, it didn't even have a single rip in it. Still in PERFECT condition after the ordeal it went through! I love this tent.",Pleasantly surprised with this tent. Great value.,"This was my first tent (and camping experience) and it went better than expected. The tent was very easy to assemble and the instructions are stitched into the packing bag so you never lose them (although after the first time assembling it you pretty much know how to do it again without the instructions). The space was perfect for our family of four, two adults and two kids. We had to install the rain cover because it was showing to rain and the tent protected us from water. It was pretty windy out, but the tent was solid. I liked that it had ventilation from two sides so the air could flow across the inside of the tent keeping the air inside fresh. A nice surprise was the little see-through pouch hanging from the inside of the tent which I assumed were for shoes, but we used it to put our cell phones in. All in all I would recommend this tent.",We like it so far,"This is a nice looking tent that will definitely serve our needs for camping. I can't tell if it's waterproof yet because we only took a day trip. It set up easy enough, though we didn't quite put the rain cover in right. Screaming kids made it hard to focus lol. We have a family of 5, so we got the 6 person size, and while it should work for us, I don't know about 6 adults! Haha you'd have to all be really good friends!"

I took this tent to a music festival, where we camped for 5 days. Here is my feedback: - Tent is very easy to put together, it took 10 minutes at most to get it up and stable. - Take down is just as easy, just a matter of how well you can roll it up and fit it back into the bag. that was our biggest challenge. - Stands up well to rain: it poured pretty severely one night and the tent inside stayed completely dry with the rain guard over. - The screened in porch got soaked though, I don't recommend leaving anything there if it's going to rain. It also kind of hard to get the water out, so if you know it will rain, I would recommend maybe putting an additional tarp over it. - We put a tarp down and put the tent on top of it for additional rain protection, so I would recommend that as well. - It's pretty massive, we had two queen size air mattresses and all of our bags and still had plenty of space. It was also very tall. I am 5'3"" and I can stand up fully and even put my arms up. - The tent packs away great, very compact. Overall, for the price, I am very impressed and would use it again and buy it again.",The best tent.,"The best tent ... EVER !! Goes up quick & easy. Looks great. I bought it for just my husband & I ~ so it's wonderfully roomy. Love the ' porch '. I put up a queen air mattress and used a rubbermaid tote as an ' end table' in the tent proper. Battery candles - cute & safe. I put a little camp table & two chairs on the porch - tho we had good weather and never really needed to sit in there. But, it would have been perfectly comfortable to hang out and play cards, drink wine, whatever - if we had. Can't say enough good things. Bought it on Prime and received it within two days. I love my tent. And so does my dog, Sugar !!",Best tent for the price,"Just came back from wv, after hurricane ida. 3nights 4 days, rained from 3am til 11pm. Other tents were leaking water from every corner possible, leaked from underneath even with tarp placed. This tent held up like a champ, maybe 3 puddles of water, size of a quarter in the corners. It was so minimal, my queen size mattress didnt get wet. Size is 11.5×14.5. 8person tent, size is including the screen room. Screen room have its own tarp on bottom unlike other tents. Corners where the screen room meeting the actual tent, theres are small holes on both corners, which is normal, water did not leak from there, water will leak from side of the screen room, which is normal cuz its ""screen room"". U should buy a small tarp with tarp pole to make a cover if u dont want screen room to get wet. One bad side is it's a dome tent, I'm 5'9"" unless I get to center of the tent, need to Hunch a bit. Used screen room as a potty room for my family of 4 including myself with portable potty, no privacy unless using tarp as a cover as stated above. I also took a deuce in there, vents easy. Inside, very roomy, was able to place two queen size air mattress, plenty of room to place duffle bags, big plastic containers, led light bars to protect from weather. When using during cold seasons, strongly recommend placing head towards the entrance, and feet far away from the door. Big wall is mesh, and covered only by the rain fly, u will literally get brain freeze when using during cold night. I couldn't sleep, had to rotate and place head by the door, and felt a huge temp difference. Overall 5/5, excellent, screen room is awesome, pros outweight the cons. Cons, just need to use ur head and adjust accordingly. Worth every penny.",I am glad I purchased a 6-person tent,"For a family of four, I am glad I purchased a 6-person tent! I was able to fit three twin size mattresses and one portable mat/pad with plenty of room to hold several miscellaneous camping items, and two backpacks inside the main sleeping area. We were able to attach two small lanterns and two small pouches inside the tent gave us the ability to hold car keys, wallets, and phones. We did not have any major issues with this tent during our camping trips. Good items to note: - Getting the tent installed is super easy, but I highly recommend reading the instructions at least once and installing the tent in your backyard before your first camping trip. It took about 15 to 20 minutes to get everything installed during our first camping trip and about 20 minutes to put everything away. Take time to fold the tent properly or you won't be able to fit all of the items inside the storage bag. - The tent was able to keep all of the annoying and nasty bugs outside and good ventilation inside the tent at night. - I was able to stand straight up in the main sleeping area which was convenient and I didn't expect this. - The screen area will not be dry during rain, but this should not be a surprise from the design of the tent, but it will hold three portable chairs as an escape from annoying flies and mosquitoes. Several concerns: - Two bottom corners in the screen area were not sealed properly and I am not sure if this is by design or the two areas that I noticed were ripped during installation. This was a concern because I didn't want any ants inside the tent, but we didn't have any problems during our camping trips. - I highly recommend purchasing heavy duty ten spikes and don't allow your teenager daughter to hammer the smaller spikes that come with the tent unless you are willing to dedicate one hour of your time making them straight again. :-) Overall, I am happy with the tent and it will last us for several years and I will update this review after our third and fourth camping trips.",Fabulous tent!,"My son and I go on a lot of camping trips with his cub scout troop. I have used this tent twice now since I bought it back in June. This tent is very roomy, easy to get move around in, and I love the mini screened in room in the front. This is very helpful if it is raining, but mainly for keeping dirty shoes the coolers, or anything else to keep close, but outside of the sleeping area. The only downfall I have run into twice now is when there is heavy rain. Inside the tent, no problems at all. Stays very dry with the rain cover on top of the tent. The screened room though can collect water because the screen stands out a little further than the rain cover. There is a ""drain"" type of cut at the door of the screen room for water to drain out through, but water can still collect if your tent is not at the best angle for camping in the rain. I suggest just bringing a small broom of some sort, so that when you breakdown your tent to pack up, you're not having to deal with all the water that might have collected in that spot of the tent."

Transporting it to places like those is not an issue, but I wouldn't try to take this hiking. The hinged door, auto roll windows, and LED lighting system are all very nice features. This is easily best tent I have ever owned. I read plenty of negative reviews of the Coleman CPX power pack and did not want to deal with additional batteries for this thing. I already take my Milwaukee power tools and their batteries along on camping trips, so I wondered if maybe I would be able to use them instead of the CPX system. Turns out, it is possible! The CPX 6 system is rated for 6 volts and 2.6 amps. Milwaukee, DeWalt, Makita, and probably other popular power tool manufacturers all have adapters for their Lithium Ion batteries that provide a USB (5 volt, 2.1 amp) output. Knowing that a 6 volt system would be considered dead around 4.7 volts, it seemed like 5 volts might work. For $1.09 I bought a male USB to female 3.5mm x 1.35mm DC power jack, which plugs right in to the existing tent wiring, and powers the LED system perfectly. Power tool Li-Ion batteries are far superior to the NiMH batteries in the CPX 6 system. Might be the best $1.09 I ever spent.",Great tent for a Family of 5 with lots of gear!,"Good Tent. Used it 3 weeks ago. I slept 5. Me, my wife and my 3 boys during a cub scout campout. I had a Queen size air bed and a full size airbed on either end of the tent and still had what seemed like 6 feet of space in between, which I used to set up a 3'x3' roll table and store my gear. The door is very convenient. It can be tricky to get the velcro to lineup, but not a big deal at all. What I really like about the door is the design. I had zipper issues with a previous tent, because of the tension put on the door. This tent zips very easily, and I can see it lasting much longer!! I got a lot of compliments from the other dads too, which is always a plus ;)",Waterproof in a hurricane on top of a mountain,"So this review is from a long time ago. I bought this tent in 2012 and after reading several of the bad reviews on it thought I would put in my two cents. Some background- I am an Eagle Scout and have done a lot of camping. If this tent leaks its because you did not put it up properly. every thing should be tight, the rain fly should not touch the tent wall and you should have a tarp on the ground that is slightly larger than the tent with the extra curled under toward the ground so that when water runs off your tent it rolls around the tarp and to the ground. So on to the review. I bought this tent to go camping with some friends in northern Alabama. we were going camping and rock climbing on top of a mountain. while we had check the weather and saw a hurricane developing in the gulf it was supposed to head for Texas so we decided to go and have some fun. the next day we spent all day rock climbing and forgot to check the weather again. that night we noticed a storm rolling in and pulled up the weather . A cat 3 Hurricane was headed right at us. we didn't have time to leave so we prepped the best we could. that night my friends tent was leaking all over the place so they stayed in mine. There was a 12"" river running under the middle of this tent. you didn't need an air mattress it was like sleeping on a waterbed. at some point in the middle of the night a small 6 in tree fell on the tent and it just brushed it off almost like nothing happened. It only broke one pole. If you put this tent up properly it is a beast. and worth the money. All tents are only limited by how good you are at setting them up. Research, Practice, Fail, and try again! Good luck and happy camping!",waterproof!!,"WOW, we just had a 2 week camping trip by the ocean. We go every year, but this year it rained soooo much, as in sheets of rain, absolute downpours. We had 2 nights where the site was so flooded, it felt like a water bed under the tent. And guess what, not a bit of water inside the tent! I am so happy with the floor of this tent, I am giving it 5 stars even though the door is annoying as the velcro doesn't match up and gets the zipper caught. Oh well, we were dry, that's what I care about! Also, the roll-down windows were way more helpful than I thought they would be, and the light was great! There was also plenty of room for a family of 4 with all of our crap (plus all the games we brought in since it was pouring outside!)",The tent is easy to to set up,"The tent is easy to to set up. I really only need another person for a couple of minutes to help put the poles in on the opposite side of me at the same time. Other than that, I could install myself in about 15 minutes. I love the light, doors, and retractable windows. However the best quality of this tent is that is indeed waterproof! We went camping and the forecast was possible light rain. It was a downpour with thunder. The campsite was completely drenched, however not a single rain drop got inside the tent. The bad thing is when I opened the door, we were basically in a lake! See picture. Everyone commented how amazed they were with my tent!"

I absolutely recommend this product and this brand i love my little cute tent.. hope my review helps someone else to get what they need",We like it so far,"This is a nice looking tent that will definitely serve our needs for camping. I can't tell if it's waterproof yet because we only took a day trip. It set up easy enough, though we didn't quite put the rain cover in right. Screaming kids made it hard to focus lol. We have a family of 5, so we got the 6 person size, and while it should work for us, I don't know about 6 adults! Haha you'd have to all be really good friends!",Its a good three seasons tent,"I'm a 6ft1 dude and 200+lbs so I don't really fit in tents. Lugging tents around has never been a problem, but I can appreciate it when a good tent comes along. So is this good? The answer is yes. This tent isn't the lightest tent, but its lighter than similar tents at the big box stores or the blue store. The tent manages this by having thinner shock rods. The tent stills sets up solid though, and it did well when I set it up in the back yard when it was pretty gusty with 15mph winds yesterday. Good! The tent is a three seasons tent. The top half is mosquito netting, but we don't have bugs this time of year so I can't really test that out. The door is the normal door-and-screen job. The tent does have two windows in the back, but it does not have a second door. If you want two doors for your two person tents, you want another tent. The people in the tent sleep N/S and the door and window are E/W, so someone has to climb over someone else for late night bathroom breaks. On the other hand, this tent is super comfy sleeping one person, and it's light enough to carry like that. I generally like tents which have two doors but it's personal preference. The guy lines are also reflective on mine, which is great, because I got it to go scout camping. People won't trip over them in the night. The rainfly is also good, it's made of a different material than the tent and it's very waterproof from me leaving it up overnight. Lots and lots of venting which is good even with the windows shut. Water in the tent makes it heavy and makes gear not be warm, so getting the condensation out of the tent is super important. I'm really happy with it, we'll see if it survives boyscouts this year.",Look no further: this is the best camping tent,"When I received this tent in the mail it was in the tiniest bag. I was immediately skeptical and thought it would be too small, but once I began assembling it, it came to its true size. I could not be more satisfied with my purchase. The tent was incredibly easy to assemble, with instructions attached to the bag so you never lose them. Every piece came in it’s own little bag inside the bigger bag, which is a + for organization. There are two “windows” on each side of the tent that open and close from the inside. The bottom is made of tarp material to avoid water inside the tent. A rainproof cover is included for a rainy day. My siblings and I are very excited to go on many camping trips this year.",Great tent with good quality!,"Already bought a tent from moon lence and must say that I'm absolutely satisfied. Material, colour, quite as lot is a promised and expected. Bought tents for my family camping vacation in the wilderness. Tent has 2 windows. one on the back and a few on the front in the door. Both windows can be closed with an additional zip. Zipper are also good quality. Nets on the inside of the tent that allow further ventilation when the windows are closed. There is also floor ventilation on the back of the tent and ground tarpaulin is a good quality. Love this types of tents because quick and easy to assemble and disassemble. Building up the tent is really easy. Also for me as a woman! Simply remove the clips during dismantling, then open the ribbon and the inside collapses cleanly. A strong rod is attached to the roof tarpaulin in 2 eyelets and fixed in the middle with a ribbon. All in all, tent is sewn clean, nothing sticks out and the seams are sealed with a transparent tape on the inside. So it can't get wet from rain inside. There is also a nice tote bag for the tent that can be pulled tight with a zipper and 2 quick clip tapes. I am very satisfied with the tent."

I was looking for something that I would not mind keeping out on the counter. This is perfect for us. It is a pastel green color. My hubby and I have our own sides so we each get the toast done the way we like it. And it is great when we have house guests. I like that the cord is long but there is a way to store underneath so it does not have to be bunched up behind it. I use the bagel setting often and it works like it says it does. I have not used the defrost setting yet. We are very happy with this purchase.,Toasting master!!!,"The media could not be loaded. This 4 slot toaster is very convenient for me and my family especially in the morning. My old toaster which was with 2 long slots just 6-shade setting and it takes a lot of time to get enough pieces of bread for the whole family toasted. Now we can do it twice as fast. Works very powerfully. 7 shade settings fulfill me and my family at one time. The bagel function is amazing! I put the cutting side face-to-face as the listing suggested, and I put my fingers on the bagel to feel, it does heat up both sides firstly and then toasts only the cutting sides about 2 minutes later, the bagels are crispy that we all love it so much!",Best ( cutest ) 4 slice toaster,"This is the cutest appliance you could ever ask for! I love the mint green color & retro style. But more importantly, the options for toasting are so incredibly helpful. We have been using this every morning since it has arrived. My husband and I can have breakfast together now instead of one of us having to eat ( so the food doesn’t get cold! )while the others bread is toasting. It has cooked toast, bagels and English muffins evenly & give them just the right amount of crisp. We highly recommend this product!",Up date.,"The media could not be loaded. I had this for around 6 months. Don’t use too often the other day my husband was using it and changed the settings, he pointed out that as turned the knob the numbers were wiping off. It’s ridiculous! Considering the price and age. Update: I was contacted by the company. Replaced toaster. The new is one perfect. Work and looks perfect. I would say it’s worth every penny.","Classy, good price, excellent function","Is it possible... can a toaster be... this sexy? Yes. Absolutely yes. This sexy toaster fit right in my farmhouse style kitchen with it's cool mint green color and retro vibes. I have made toast with it and a toasted sandwich with cream cheese and thin sliced turkey - it was delicious! This toaster pops so quiet I missed it, twice!!! My toast was cold, but then I noticed this amazing thing also has a REHEAT button!!! So no worries if you miss that pop sound. Your roommates won't even hear you make toast in the night.... Pros: Four slots and they are the wide and long type meaning those fancier breads fit without squishing the sides of your slice. It has a bagel setting, as well as that nifty reheat button so your toast doesn't get burnt or overly crispy if you aren't hovering over it and miss it pop up and have to retoast it. The LED lights around the buttons are kind of cool too. It is fairly easy to clean, just dump the tray, so no worries about crumbs or bits of bread burning in the bottom and ruining the perfect taste of your slice. The knobs have a neat texture and are adjustable so you can time it just right for Pop Tarts (2), toast (3.5) or toasted sandwich bread (4). And who really goes past 4 anyways? I mean, the setting is there so you can, but let's face it if you are setting your toast past 4 on the dial you probably should seek out some sort of therapy. If you are using 7 (and it does go up to 7) then mayne you should go to your room and start considering why you hate toast and what it has ever done to you to warrant that. Cons: My husband is a little jealous of how much I love this toaster, and has been asking me if it is better than him. What could I say? I mean it makes TOAST, all he makes is methane gas so... Maybe consider ordering a couples therapy workbook to go with this toaster when purchasing. PS. NO, I am not receiving any promotional consideration for my review of this beautiful toaster I just really, really love it! If you think that makes me weird... then you probably just haven't found the right toaster for you yet. Don't worry, it will happen... especially if you buy this one."

This is our second one of these. The previous one lasted for several years before it started toasting unevenly. I’ve had this new one for a few months now. It is just as durable as the previous model, if not better. With any toaster you should not be too forceful with the levers or they’re not going to last. I press down gently and there’s no problem. This was the only toaster in the $25-30 price range when I bought it. Sorry, but I’m not willing to pay $50 plus for a toaster— this isn’t rocket science. I grew up with a mom who used a Sunbeam stand mixer that lasted forever. I trust the brand.",Awesome toaster,After using a cheap Dollar store toaster for years I finally decided to get a good toaster. The four slice toaster is a great option for a family. One of my favorite things about this toaster is the fact that the bread pops up good and high and I don't have to dig in the toaster to get my bread out. There's also a way that you push the lever up a little bit and it will bring the bread up to a level that you can pick it up. I can't say enough good things about this toaster is pretty as well as works great!,Great Toaster if you are careful,Excellent operating toaster = my only fault would be the chintzy thin plastic lever used to lower the toast. I know it will eventually break as it is the weakest point on an otherwise excellent toaster.,Qualify Product!!!,This is the 2nd Sunbeam toaster I've purchased. My first one lasted a Very long time! I would definitely say it is a quality toaster! I'm sure I will continue to enjoy this one. I have only one complaint - the cord is in a different location. The new one has the cord on the side towards the front of the toaster. This keeps the toaster too close to the wall. I still Love it!,Works with lots of bread sizes and 4 slices at once,At first (like with any plastic outer shelled toaster) there is a strong plastic burning smell. But it doesn't affect the food taste or anything like that and only is strong at the first 5 or so cycles. I wanted to replace my 2 piece toaster for a 4 piece one and this one works for what I need. It toasts one side of the bread pretty evenly between the 4 slices and the other side is slightly less toasted but that's the way I like it anyway. The stop toast knob works great and is pretty accurate. I set both knobs to about the same level and I'm pleased with the result: 4 pieces of toast at once. A quick efficient way to eat toast.

Therefore, differences in moisture level from one bread to another can result in varying toasting times. For slightly dry bread, use a lower setting than you normally would. For very fresh bread or whole wheat bread, use a higher setting than normal. Breads with very uneven surfaces (such as English muffins) will require a higher toast setting. Thickly cut pieces of bread (including bagels) will take longer to toast, sometimes significantly longer, since more moisture must be evaporated from the bread before toasting can occur. Very thick pieces may require two cycles. Cleaning and Maintenance Always allow the toaster to cool completely before cleaning. Do not use abrasive cleansers. Simply wipe the exterior with a clean damp cloth and dry thoroughly. Apply any cleansing agent to a cloth, not to the toaster, before cleaning. To remove crumbs, slide out the crumb tray and discard crumbs. Wipe clean and replace. Never operate the toaster without the crumb tray in place. To remove any pieces of bread remaining in the toaster, turn the toaster upside down and gently shake. Never insert any hard or sharp instruments into the slot, as this could damage the toaster and cause a safety hazard. Never wrap the cord around the outside of the toaster. Use the cord storage cleats on the underside of the toaster. Product Dimensions The Cuisinart 2-Slice Metal Classic Toaster measures approximately 10.75"" x 7.13"" x 7.13"".

What a difference in quality!!!! I freeze my bread because we don't use it often...so, I placed the frozen bread in the toaster, depressed the lever - and it was a solid click!!! Then I pressed the DEFROST button. I assumed I would then have to press it again to toast but no, it knew to defrost THEN toast. It toasted to perfection. The pull out tray is nicely located in the front. The slots are plenty wide. The body is not flimsy. On my old toaster I was patting it on the side upside down to remove ALL the crumbs and it dented!!! This one is definitely worth the extra money. My son has had his for years...meanwhile I have gone through 5 cheaper brands.",Best toaster after research,"The Cuisinart CPT-180 Metal Classic 4-Slice Toaster, Brushed Stainless is the best toaster that I found after significant research on Amazon and other website, and in stores like BestBuy and Bed, Bath & Beyond. - First, and most importantly, it toasts properly - evenly and without drying out the bread. I tried also Kenmore Elite 76774 4-Slice Auto-Lift Long Slot Toaster in Stainless Steel but I returned it because it was drying out the toast too much and it was huge, taking up a lot of countertop space. - Not too big - never understand why some toasters are as big as a toaster oven or a small microwave... It's a simple appliance. The CuisineArt toaster is just the right size. - Beautifully designed with some retro elements - Affordable mid range price - practically 2-3 times cheaper than the expensive non-professional toasters, like Breville, etc. NOTE: I had the toaster for less than a week. I cannot comment on the product reliability or CuisineArt's customer support quality. Future will tell... :)",Cuisinart Versus Oyster,"I’ve only had it a week. So far it’s great. We had an Oyster brand for 7 years. It stopped working so I decided to get another Oyster. It’s a 4 slice and the lever on the left side wouldn’t stay down after about one year. After reading tons of reviews from the most expensive toasters to the really cheap ones, I found that it didn’t matter the price or brand, you were taking a chance on getting a lemon. I bought the Cuisinart 4 slice because it’s the one that I was comparing the Oyster 4 slice to when I bought the Oyster a year ago. Since this Oyster didn’t last as long as my old Oyster I went with the Cuisinart this time. So far I noticed that the coils in the Cuisinart light up a lot better ( more evenly) than the Oyster. I’m no longer getting toast with one side darker than the other and light & dark spots because some of the coils didn’t get hot on the Oyster. The other thing I noticed right away is the Cuisinart’s leavers went down with ease and stayed down. I had to snap the Oyster’s leavers down hard and fast to get them to catch. That’s probably why one leaver on the Oyster stopped catching. The Cuisinart was 3 &1/2 times pricier than the Oyster so Im hopeful it’s a case of you get what you pay for. So far I have no complaints about the Cuisinart. If I was LOOKING for something to complain about on a personal level, it’s so quiet that when it’s done toasting I don’t hear it pop. Also, (this goes for every toaster on the market) it’s hard to toast pop tarts without loosing them down the sides. I’m not a fan of and don’t buy beagles or thick bread. I would pay 10 times more for a toaster that would toast normal slices of bread and pop tarts without the hassle. I will give an update after I’ve had the Cuisinart a while longer.",Great gift for married daughter,"My daughter's toaster of many years bit the dust, so I looked around for something nice for her birthday and came across this model. It looks kind of retro which fits her tastes, so I had it sent to her house. She has raves about how well it works and it is the best toaster she ever had. She is not just saying that to me because it was a gift - If she had a problem with it, she would tell me. It handles bread or other items up to 1.5 inches wide. Plus the slide out crumb tray is really nice to have. It has a setting called defrost. It has controls to set the amount of browness on your toast, too. The defrost setting works good if you are just taking your bread slices out of the freezer. You don't have to wait for them to unthaw. But she loves the toaster. Says it works great for english muffins and thicker bread and she is very happy with it.",I did a ridiculous amount of research,"Because this is about my sixth toaster, albeit half of those were from goodwill or yardsales, and I was ready to be done buying toasters. [fingers crossed] I can confirm that this one does an excellent job, evenly toasted on both sides and dark as I want, while still soft on the inside—so, no “melba toast” effect where the whole slice becomes a dry plank. (Like when you make toast in a toaster oven.) There’s a very similar Cuisinart model at Costco that I almost bought, but prefer the rotary knobs and also this one takes up a little less space because the levers aren’t “frenched in” by moving the whole surface outward."

Works great and I like the look. I did read about the smell it produces in the beginning, so I was prepared for it. I read that a few people put their toasters out in the garage to air out the smell. But, if you live in the city and don't have a garage or porch, put the toaster by a window, heat it up a few times, (I needed to do it 5 times) and use a fan to push the stink outside. It worked for me. The smell is gone and it works fine. It was worth the effort.",Great toaster!,"This is really nice, has lots of options and settings for 1-4 items at a time! Works perfectly, can be really light toast or very dark. Easy to dump the crumbs out. Easy to use, nice simple and clean design. Love it! Would order again. Came with a warranty to fill out through Cuisinart which is nice.",Best toaster ever!,"This is THE best toaster I've ever bought. If I could give it more stars, I would. if you're a bagel lover then you need to buy this. It browns perfectly on the outside yet stays softer on the inside. I never realized that some toast could taste differently than other toast, but this takes it to a whole new level. Who would have thought there could be this many accolades for an appliance? I suppose it seems silly, but just trying to be helpful. I guess, if I could change one thing, I would put the cord rewind on the back of the toaster instead of underneath, but that is a very trivial suggestion and does not affect the operation of this at all.","Read the Instructions—Safe, Toasts on Both Sides","Appears some of the negative reviews maybe because the writers failed to read the directions. The toaster toasts on both sides of the bread if one does not press the buttons. Simply turn the dial to select how well toasted you like your bread, then press down the toaster lever. Caution: Do not toast under a cabinet...do not leave the room.",Toast to the Toaster!,"I purchased this item in white as needed a new toaster. I was not sure which product would work best for me. I usually have toast or bagel on the go in the mornings. After reading many, many reviews on the different toaster purchase options, I decided on this one. It provides an even toast, but did require a few initial toasts to determine the perfect setting for me. It works great, is easy to clean, and is simple to use. Works great for larger bagels as well."

The defrost feature is nice. It has the bagel feature and we've used it.

The product will produce a very bad chemical smell that will fade after you run the product a few times. I ran the toaster about 5 times without any bread in it to completely get rid of the smell.

Toaster are mostly expensive and it's hard to find one that is reliable, doesn't overheat your bread (and I'm French so I know what I'm talking about!). This toaster has many different functions (e.g. bagel). The support help if you want not to toast but for instance just warm a ""croissant"" or ""pain au chocolat""! I have been using it every morning for 1 week and the regulator also makes sure that I don't burn my slices. Great design as well and this natural beige color looks really neat! Feels like a high-end product, but for a good price. Anyway, great. Five stars.","WOW, great toaster from a new brand!","I took a chance and ordered this toaster because of the design and price. I never heard of the brand, but then again I never heard of ""LG"" either and look at what they've become. I've owned lots of toasters - from a $300 toaster from Williams Sonoma others from Wal Mart. Time will tell if this holds up but toasters are inherently disposable - they don't last forever. someone obviously took the time to design this - the features are great, it has a modern timeless look, and the ""warming stand"" on top is unique. Pus, it works great (my son thought it was an antennae!). The main thing I look for is the bread toasting function, and this toasts evenly and quickly. I like the way you can dial in a setting and it has a lit cancel button. It appears well-made and was carefully packaged. The instruction manual suffers from language translation, but it's easy to understand. For the price, I think it's a great buy. Another reason why Amazon is taking over the world!",Great design and quality!,Loooooove this toaster from design to functionality!! And the bagel toaster racks on top are awesome feature!! and it’s quick!! Way better toaster than the one I had before!!!,Save a lot of time for my breakfast,"The media could not be loaded. I’v been using the toaster for two weeks. It works good. It was a hard time for me to choose which one to buy just two weeks ago. I read lots of reviews on different brands. They all have complaints. Finally I made my decision simply by the foldable rock design. After a week of use, I know better of it. I list em below. Pros It roasts maximum 4 slice a time, fast supply for a family’s breakfast. In addition, 2 different browns a time, satisfied different needs. There are enough adjustable functions-how brown, one side or two sides roasting. With the foldable racks, it fits not only sliced bread, but all shapes ones. It is easy to clean the surface, and I believe metal is more durable than plastic. Cons The roaster is light-weighted. It slips easily on the counter when I press the function buttons. It is difficult to clean the inside with a dishcloth. The only way I can do is heat it before use. Cautions Turn the round switch from small numbers, you may need several test before you know which number makes the brown you want. After push down the lever, don’t forget to press the function button-defrost or bagel, otherwise the lever will not pop up automatically. The surface is very hot after use. Leave it aside for a while, it will cool down."

This is my 4th or 5th toaster in the past 30 days; started out with of the most expensive toasters thinking at that price it has to toast perfectly; WRONG. Not only did it not toast on both sides but the bread would get stuck when it popped up. On to the hunt for the best toaster and reading dozens and dozens of reviews. Who knew this was more work than purchasing a new car!!! All I want is my toast to toast evenly on both sides - it that so hard to do???? Think about it - it's a TOASTER; isn't that the whole idea of a toaster? Put bread in, little-heated elements inside the toaster light up and cook the toast for a short time and then pop up. So why do some toaster toast one side OK and the other side is toasted randomly (maybe the top OR bottom or just the side). Hmmm, makes me wonder what's going on in their quality control :-). Anyway, I found the perfect toaster and this is it!! Great price, toasts evenly on BOTH sides just the way a toaster should. Don't hesitate if you're looking for a toaster to do a good job; don't let the fact that because this toaster is relatively inexpensive it's not a good toaster because it is - it's the BEST toaster. I've used it now for over a month and I continue to be impressed. English muffins have never been so well and evenly toasted.

Although the bread would warm, it did not brown at all, until suddenly the bread would blacken and burn within seconds. Unfortunately, since the glass window in the toaster oven does not reach the bottom, we were never sure when the bread would start burning until we smelled it. Therefore we had two options, either eat warmed, untoasted bread, or take the chance and with any luck the bread would turn out very dark brown (not quite black), but unfortunately it usually would burn. Since we have enough kitchen appliances crowding our kitchen counter, I wanted a small 2- slice pop-up toaster, and without any extra ‘bells and whistles’. General Description: This Hamilton 2-slice pop-up toaster is perfect. It’s a lightweight compact toaster and it only measures 11” x 6”, with a 7 ¼” height, therefore it takes up very little space. In addition, since this toaster weighs less than 2 lbs. (1 lb. and 14 oz.), it’s not heavy, and I can easily put it away in a cabinet. It has a 30” electrical cord with a 2-prong plug. The color is a high gloss bright cherry red on the front and back, with a chrome finish on the top and sides. The spring loaded toaster slots are 5 ¼” long, x 1 ¼ “wide (to accommodate the thickness), and with a depth to fit and toast a 4” slice of bread, muffin, a sliced bagel or a sliced roll. This pop-up toaster has the cord storage area on the end and the cord remains coiled up securely and out of the way. The other end has the controls, which consists of a lever that is so easy to operate that I can use my pinky finger to push it down. A dial with a range of 1 – 7 controls the browning level, and there are segments between each number for a very precise toasting crunch and color. In addition there is a ‘cancel’ press button, to stop the toasting cycle and pop the slice up to the top. On the bottom is an attached crumb catcher tray that slides to the side for easy emptying and cleaning. Performance: There are 7 main settings for toast color and crunch, with the lightest at the number #1 and the toasting gets progressively darker and crispier as the dial adjustment moves to #7. I prefer the #4 toasting level for a light brown color and a mild crunch. This takes approximately 1 ½ - 2 minutes in the toaster, and the chrome sides remain comfortable to the touch. My toast cooks evenly in both slots and both sides of each slice have the identical crunch and color. We are very pleased with this Hamilton 2-slice pop-up toaster. It’s lightweight, fast and efficient, and it browns both sides of the bread evenly. We use it for bread, sliced bagels, hamburger buns, and English muffins, it is exactly what we needed.",Changed review to 5 star,"I originally bought this toaster Dec 2017. It only worked for a month and stopped so I wrote a bad review. It turned out to be owner error. When I originally purchased this toaster, I researched toasters and saw so many bad reviews at all price points. So I was not surprised it stopped working. Now it is June 2020 and this fifteen dollar toaster is still working great. I just ordered the same toaster again .",Great lightweight toaster from Hamilton Beach!,"I had an old toaster that has lasted a very long time until a few weeks ago. I bought this one because it is a Hamilton Beach and it has cool walls. I was always burning myself on my old one. I have tested this toaster on bagels and it toasts just fine. I like it on the 4 setting which is right in the middle. It keeps the bagel crisp but not burnt. I put my hands directly on the sides while and immediately after it was done and there is no heat coming through. Excellent! Besides the brand name and the cool walls, I also love that it is lightweight and has a place in the back to wrap the cord for storage. I keep my toaster on a shelf in my kitchen so the cord wrap keeps it neater. I have had no problems with this toaster and my only complaint would be that if I lived in Canada the warranty would be 5 years but in the USA it is only 1 year. What is up with that?","Toasts, and fast","Pros: Toasting works great. I read some reviews complaining about over-toasting - I don't have this problem. On setting 3 (out of 6) it's a bit under-toasted to my taste, and 4 is perfect. And, it works surprisingly fast! I hated so much staring at old toaster for long minutes, begging to pop already as life were mercilessly slipping away. Cons: The lever feels kind of flimsy and I am afraid to break it, especially since you need to push it a bit hard to lock it down. This is my main concern about durability. Also, the top panel does get very hot (the side panels do not), so be careful. Other notes: 1. I let run empty a couple of times before using it with bread, to let out some weird smell that it had in the beginning. It went away quickly. 2. Color, in case you care: It's brighter than shown in the product images. It's as if they were taken in a dimly lit setting. The actual color is fiery red with a slight lean towards cherry, or something like that. Overall I'm happy, and it seems to be worth its price. *** Update: After using this for a while, I'm updating from 4 to 5 stars. It's really great.",Quality toaster for price,"This toaster is so affordable that even if it malfunctions eventually it is no big deal. I've bought much more expensive toasters and frequently stopped working and I had to take the time to call the company, request a replacement, and wait for a week or so to receive a new toaster. I noticed this toaster had a longer warranty than my kitchen aid toaster which only had a year warranty! It says not to toast pop tarts in this toaster. That probably voids warranty if they found lots of pop tart jelly in your toaster. My husband thought that was so strange you couldn't put pop tarts in the toaster but oh well..we really don't eat them often at all. Before my first use of this toaster, I depressed the handle and did a toast without toast to burn off any chemicals or oils that remained from manufacturing. After that, it's worked marvelously. Will update if I have any problems!"

Why should anyone want to write a review of the most used and easiest to forget ancillary appliance you own? Because the Dash Clear View Toaster is that awesome! The short of it; don’t waste your time looking for anything else. This toaster can handle anything you throw at it with golden brown perfection, quickly. The Dash Clear View Toaster is the best bang for your buck, hands down! The long of it. We are a “somewhat” healthy eating family. We run the gambit when it comes to bread choices. Hardly ever white, mostly wheat for the kids, and tapioca and/or rice bread for the adults. Not all breads toast to perfection at the same rate. Each one of these breads has a very specific heat tolerance that can make for difficult toasting times. And that’s where the window really comes in handy. With the Dash Clear View Toaster you can sit back and enjoy the toasting experience all while watching the progress through its’ front window. Gone are the days of premature toast ejection just to check on the “doneness” of a specific bread only to have to reinsert the payload back into the heated bay. Visible perfection each and every time. With the white or Tapioca bread, which toast rather quickly, a quick turn to 4 gives us the perfect amount of crunch. The wheat bread takes slightly longer, about a 5 to a 5.5 max. And then there is the ALWAYS FROZEN rice bread. This beast of a bread (Food for Life brand) is twice toasted. Once as a 7 with “defrost” selected and a second plunge at a 7 without the “defrost” selected. AMAZING! The controls are easy to understand, clearly marked and simple to operate. Plug it in, place the toast in the slot provided, push down the plunger and away you go. It takes a matter of a use or two to figure out the proper settings to your liking. The “defrost” feature just doubles the time on the dial. The “bagel” feature only toasts on one side. With some sandwich breads like rye / pumpernickel etc. that have a tendency to toast really well and tear-up the roof of your mouth I like to use the bagel setting. Put the toasted side to the inside (meat side) and the soft untoasted side to the outside, you get the crunch without tearing up the roof of your mouth. AWESOMNESS! I have yet to use the “re-heat” feature … so you are on your own with that one. Sorry Charlie. As far as the toast rocketing from the toaster with the velocity of an unladen swallow, African or Eurpean – doesn’t matter, I have found that to be inconsequential. Does it pop up and sometime flop out on its own? Yes, rarely. But that has happened with my old toaster as well (a re-gifted 2 slice Panasonic that we got as a wedding gift 22 years ago). So really I kind of like the nostalgia of it when it does happen. BONUS! Let’s just hope that I get 22 years out of this amazing beast. So in conclusion, I just wrote an essay on a toaster. What the hell am I thinking?! Yes, it is that great. Click the “Add to Cart” button and get the Dash Clear View Toaster. You will not regret yourself for doing so, unlike your college spring break weekend. Love you son!","Well designed, great looking...and it toasts!","Just short of our 25th anniversary our old toaster (guess when we got it) bit the dust. There is limited counter space in the kitchen of our Victorian home and we thought the wall hugging design of this toaster was a good idea. The design has a sort of 1950s vibe to it - sort of a Wurlitzer juke box or maybe a little hint of Flash Gordon going on. We really like it. The PROs: *Can't say enough good about being able to see how your toast is doing - it's a whole dimension of usefulness that other toasters don't even address. *All controls are up front and highly visible - no more having to crane your neck down to the side of your toaster to see which button is which - and then having to guess anyway because the printing has probably worn off...or having to wonder which way you have to turn the dial to get your toast lighter or darker. *Really nice looking and a bit different. We like things that are a bit different, like each other, or our kids, or our dogs. The CONs: *I thought about dinging it a star because, as others have reported, the ejection spring is a bit - how shall we put it? - enthusiastic. Especially with a smaller or lighter item it will occasionally launch your breakfast right out of the slot. But on second thought we find this amusing rather than annoying - and far preferable to having to fish your toast out of the slot because your spring has lost its mojo. So we actually consider this a little plus. In case you're wondering, when you select bagel it toasts the side that's facing the window so you can still see how your toast is doing, so the designers were on the ball there. Right now ours tends to brown more quickly toward the top than the bottom but other reviewers have noted that this somehow evens out over time so we'll give it the benefit of the doubt and hope this will happen with ours. It's not drastically uneven but it is noticeable right now. My wife was a bit hesitant to spend more than about twenty bucks for a toaster but we're both glad we did as this thing is designed so very well, looks absolutely great, and is something that is just a bit different from the standard polished cube, adding a touch of style to the kitchen counter. And being able to see how our toast is doing means we may well never burn a breakfast again. Outstanding!",Update: make sure the crumb tray is in place!,"UPDATE: We thought it was broken because it wouldn't depress. turns out the crumb tray wasn't in place and this is some sort of safety mechanism. LURVE THIS TOASTER! One of the best features is that the buttons for the different settings (defrost, toast, bagel) don't have printing on them which can rub off over time effectively rendering them useless (I'm looking at you Oster). And it provides a surprising amount of entertainment for my kids and I what with the window to my toast's progress and the occasional flying toast which has so far landed quite helpfully on top of the toaster slot, actually making it very easy to retrieve our toast. Another unhappy mention for the Oster - it wouldn't pop the toast after maybe six months and I caught my kids fishing their toast out with a fork. Thankfully they have the sense to unplug it, but still. I have yet to comment on durability. My toaster is used, then put away, so it does need to be sturdy. I'll be happy if it outlasts my stupid Oster which didn't see it's first birthday.",Early in the morning toast looks like a sunrise in its window and toast in the ...,"This toaster is worth the price just for the entertainment value. Early in the morning toast looks like a sunrise in its window and toast in the evening is like watching the sunset by the orange glow in the see thru window. Some toast pops out and lands on top ready to pick up, sometimes the toast is found sitting on the counter next to the toaster when it has popped up, this will all depend on the weight of the bread (12 grain VS Wonder white)Seriously it does toast bread evenly and works good. I would try to toast breadsticks but I am afraid I might get hit by the flying bread sticks as they launch. Would buy again and have recommended to friends.",Home Run!,"This is a very interesting toaster. There are two rods (about 1/4inch diameter by 11 inches long) at the bottom that get red hot and radiate upwards to toast. This is one reason I bought this toaster; I’m hoping that these rods will last longer and give better service than the old skinny wires that seem to go bad in spots in no time at all. We will see about this over time. But, the main reasons I give five stars to this toaster is 1) great look, 2) one long toaster slot, 3)view window, 4)unique heating elements. I can now toast odd things like hot dog and hamburger buns; or large bagels or even large pieces of bread from a loaf! And can decide to toast on one side or both! The only negative thing I can say is; I wish the crumb tray would slide out from the same side as the lever to start toasting. Other than that one minor want, this toaster is a home run! Worth the 50bucks! And would recommend this item to anyone interested. Thanks, Reamo"

First, I really appreciate that it doesn’t pop toast completely up when done, so you get your toast hot, also the keep warm function is available if needed! The toast lift feature is great when you’re ready to remove toast so you don’t risk burnt fingers having to mess around with toaster tongs. Turns out that this is my favorite feature/s. The thinner design is part of what attracted me to this toaster. It takes up less counter space than typical 4 slot toasters. Also, we like to toast artisan & rye breads which often have longer bread slices and fit easily in this toaster's slots. The beep when toast is ready is nice, though I could do without the beep when starting toaster. I’m not sure what purpose that serves. Defrost function is great for frozen waffles, bagels or bread & nice to have keep warm option. Easy to use, if using just one slot, it doesn’t matter which slot is used, unlike some toasters. Do be aware that even when not using bagel option, which toasts just one side, that one side of toast is darker than other. Never had thought about it before, but I actually find it preferable to have one side of toast crisp & the other side a little less crispy. Since relatively new, I can’t speak to longevity yet.",A SUPERB TOASTER AFTER A SIMPLE FIX!,"I purchased this 22811 toaster at Costco (they were giving them away for only $20 and may still be). It has all the latest features, plus you can BURN the hell out of yourself by touching the metal top after toasting (nice feature!). But, big surprise, every feature works as advertised! Can't say it's quick ... takes 3 minutes to toast one piece of nice whole wheat with a setting of 5. And it BEEPS ... a lot! It beeps once when it starts, and three times when it stops! And if you have KEEP WARM selected, it beeps every minute during warming and then beeps three times and pops up the toast after only 3 minutes of warming. Evidence that the designers were smoking some strong stuff is the fact that the CORD comes out IN FRONT! And the crumb tray is in the BACK! After all my tests I decided to keep this beast because it does a good job toasting, all the features work properly, and toast does NOT drop past the tray (an almost daily occurrence on my previous toasters when using thin, German flatbread ... maddening). I fixed the cord problem by using fine wire to attach the cord just below the crumb tray (it comes out the back at the point of the tray's finger cutout), so it works like a charm now. See photos for how I did it. I do wonder why it's so difficult to design a proper toaster though. Cord out the BACK ... NO BURN surfaces ... crumb tray in FRONT ... NO BEEPING ... no chance of toast FALLING BELOW the bread tray (the Ham Beach does very well in that department) ... buttons that WORK like they should (ditto) ... and FAST toasting ... is that too much to ask? Evidently it is. SIX MONTHS LATER: Surprised to say that this toaster has provided yeoman service and perfect toast since day one. The beeping isn't that loud (my microwave IS) and does provide notice that the toaster is ON and OFF, which is nice. My cord fix hasn't budged and works beautifully. If I could give an accurate score to this toaster now, it would be a 4.7 ... since I can't, I'm changing my score to a FIVE! Love this puppy!","Sleek style, retractable cord, working fine so far","This toaster works great so far and I love all the features. For a toaster under $30, I’m very happy. It’s very easy to clean and I LOVE the retractable cord which ACTUALLY WORKS. You do have to hold the cord flat and retract it a little at a time but still, it only takes a few seconds. I like this toaster so much I ordered one for my daughter in England...she just received it on Jan 26th, a week early! I’m not sure why there are so many bad reviews but they seem to be about the silver colored toasters. Maybe this is a newer improved model?",A Great Toaster!,"I've only used this toaster for a few weeks but I give it high marks!! I love the fact that it beeps when it begins and even better that it beeps when the toast comes up! While that may seem insignificant, I used that ""beeping"" the other day. I was making my eggs, coffee and forgot I had started the toaster. When it beeped, it reminded me that ""Hey!"" Toast's up! Better get it buttered while it's good and hot!"" (Of course, it didn't SAY that! LOL! - but the beep did remind me it was time to pay attention to the toaster!). Most important is this the great, even toasting. The ability to toast 4 slices of bread at one time is also great. I love the sleek, slim design while giving me plenty of space to toast a bagel or muffin. I gave it only 4 stars for ""Easty To Use"" because the dial for the degree of toasting is at the very bottom of all the controls. That makes it difficult to see and dial in your selection. All in all I give this Hamilton Beach 4 Slice Toaster a big THUMBS UP!",Finally! A Toaster That Does What It Is Supposed To Do!,"A toaster is a toaster, right? Wrong! I had no idea how hard it would be to find a toaster that actually did what it is supposed to do without spending a fortune. When did toasters get so complicated? And when did toasters get so expensive? I saw some for close to $200! Well, I tried several toasters and even a toaster oven. Finally, this one is the one that did what it is supposed to do. It toasts evenly, it will hold long toast such as sourdough bread, it will toast bagels correctly by only toasting one side as God intended, it will even allow you to set for one slice. It is also easy to clean, but come on how often do we really clean our toasters? So, for the price, this does what it is supposed to do. No frills, no fluff, just a toaster that operates as it is intended. You can't go wrong with this one. Unless you're some sort of chef that needs one of those $200 ones, but even then I can't see where those do anything different or better than this one!"

I think the problem maybe the electronics on the led may be bad. Too bad, seemed like a great deal with all the batteries, mount, and charger."" Updated review: The seller/manufacturer reached out to me via email after I had already returned the faulty light, they were offering to replace the light. I explained to them that I had already returned the light and already received a refund. They still insisted on sending me a new light, explaining that I must have received a defective light. They were adamant that I receive and test a new light because they stand behind their products and being a small company, word of mouth(reviews) are paramount. I received the new light within a couple days, 1st thing I did to test the light was smack it around on my desk and then proceeded to drop it waist and head high on a carpeted floor. The LED didn't even flicker. I am convinced that the 1st light I received was an outlier and does not represent the majority of their products. What makes me even more confident that this light will be more than adequate for my uses is that the company stands behind their products. 4.5 stars for the light, a great value for $30-ish, (light, 2 rechargable batteries, charger, rail mount, and two switch caps. 5 stars for customer service","TL:DR bright, compact and light. Great buy","*UPDATE* OK I've had this about 6 months and it does great. Added photos of my back yard. The machinery is about 80-100 yards away and the dog is about 30-40 yards away. I've had this about 3 weeks now and I really like it. For ¼ the price of a stream light I got a pressure pad, mount, 2 batteries and a charger. It's really bright! So for indoors and CQB I'd say this is too bright. Outdoors is where it excels. It will easily light up to 300ft clearly and somewhat light up 500 ft or 0.1 miles. I was unsure buying this but I really like it on my AR15. It's mounted very far forward next to the muzzle brake and the lens has not shattered or anything. I do however reccomend thred locker on the mounting screws and mounting nut. Especially the nut that holds it to the rail. It likes to come loose. My only complaint is that there is no double sided tape or velcro to mount the pressure pad. It also comes with a standard click button rear cap if you do not want to run the pressure switch. The pressure switch its self is dual function. You can have momentarily on or click a button for permanently on. I find that very nice. I reccomend this over a surefire or any name brand for the price. If I ever break this I will definitely buy another. This light does get hot after about 10 mins of continuous use. I've run about 150 rounds through the AR15 with this light and it worked great . Night hunting for animals, I havent shot but have lit up a deer's eyes about 550 to 600 ft off my back porch in the field when my dog got agitated about something in the back yard. I think this is a great white light hunting light for nuisance animals. It doesnt add a lot of weight to the rifle and mounting it to the right side of my rifle I dont notice it is even there. TL:DR great bright light. Would buy again",With updated pressure switch!,"Of the inexpensive tactical lights on Amazon, I have found this one to be one of the most reliable. Previous versions had a very questionable pressure switch setup. The latest version has a much better pressure switch configuration, and has managed to survive quite a bit of abuse. I am not a professional, nor am I a competition person, I am just an individual who will need to depend on a simple flashlight in a highly unlikely situation. I am not of the mindset that the only way to guarantee quality is to spend more money. I have also had highly expensive accessories fail on me at the wrong time. So, given my track record with this type of light (I own three, and they have worked flawlessly for the last three years) I trust this wil turn on when I need it to. (Just make sure you periodically charge the batteries) Great value for the non-law enforcement, non-competition, value-minded shooter.",A great gun light,This is my first light I dod not use the mount that was included as o already had a mount. This light comes in just a bit under one inch. So if you use it with a one inch mount you will have to take up that extra space. I used a single layer of duct tape. It is now tight in the one inch mount. I put this on an old school Icatha modle 37 Kind of a home protection with an extended tube magazine. At one time a lot of LEO's carried these Its a good ole gun shoots slugs good put to 80 to 100 yards and buck shot patterns tight out of it. The light is every bit as bright as advertised It's about a perfect size so I do not care that it's not adjustable. The light switch works great in either mode and has not given me any trouble. The only problem I have is deciding were to attach it for best use. Another great thing is it makes that front sight glow bright so you have no trouble seeing the sights in the dark.,Great Product! Highly Recommend it!,"Amazingly GREAT product! Very well built & high qaulity! For the price, you can not beat it. It is an Awesome Flashlight"

Makes life easier on these Old Marine bones. Semper Fi",Great bipod,I love Magpul products so I was excited when they release their own bipod for the market. I've put almost 200 rounds through my Predator with this bipod attached and have been pleased with it. It's very functional for what you're paying for it and I will definitely be getting another for MLOK,A game changer...however know its limitations.,"This is an exceptional bipod for AR-15s and other rifles under 10 pounds. First and foremost it is extremely light weight. Possibly the lightest on the market with the features it brings to the table. The price is outstanding as well considering the impressive list of capabilities is has. I dare you to find another bipod in this price range that is this light with the ability to cant and pivot the weapon. It has a considerable of flex, and is meant to be ""weighted"" prior to pulling the trigger by pushing or pulling the gun. The knurled knob is excellent and makes on the fly adjustments easier than getting your dog to eat of bite of steak. When stowed it can be cranked down preventing the pod from moving around. It is not as stable as a Harris with spring loaded legs but to pull of a 11 oz pod with the same features as a Harris sacrifices must be made. The legs adjust super fast with push button retraction and will not fold up when loaded. Not being spring tension legs, you also do not have to worry about unexpected folding and the bloody hands that go along with it. Magpul always comes correct with new products and this is no exception. Just realize the limitations of this pod before buying. This is a light and fast style pod meant long patrols or long humps to that tree stand or final firing position. If you just shooting of the bench at the range there may be better options for you.",It Works,"If you read any of the reviews, and there are many, you see many repetitive complaints; it wobbles, it's plastic, it's just wrong, so on and so forth. I liken it back to when auto makers stopped making metal dashboards and started using plastic. People whined back then, also. Didn't matter that the new dashboard was safer, didn't matter that the new dashboard was better, all that mattered was it was different. It wasn't the way it always was. Fast forward to now. Bipods used to heavy. Bipods used to be all metal. Exposed springs like some steampunk contraption at a festival. Close a metal bipod the wrong way, you got blood on your hands. Literally. Enter Magpul. Magpul reinvented the bipod. Lightweight polymers (not plastic), no exposed springs. Streamline. More features are standard that cost extra on other metal bipods. More advanced then the 1930's style metal bipods so common, even today. Let's look at the ""faults"" that those who hate to evolve and accept technological advances have repeated over and over; 1. ""It's wobbly."". No it's not. If you know how to USE a bipod properly, it's not wobbly. Load the bipod correctly (and if you don't know what that means, don't buy a bipod) and it's rock steady. The ""wobble"", per se, was purposely built into the bipod so you CAN load it properly. 2. ""Too much plastic"". First off, it's Magpul's proprietary polymer that they invented, it's NOT plastic. Same polymer that their stocks, mags, grips are made of. No one finds faults with them, only the ""bipod people"" find faults with using their polymer. Metal is used where it needs to be, but because it's different, it's too modern, purists refuse to adapt. They want the bipod they started using in the 70's. Those days are gone. Those that hate this product probably still whine about the good ol' days and still miss their pagers and flip phone that only made phone calls. Now to those that think I'm a young'n whining about the old folks, I'm 60 years old. I ain't young. But I'm not afraid of technology. The ""good ol' days"" weren't all that great. THESE are the good ol' days. To those reading the negative comments, disregard them. They know not of what they speak. This is an excellent MODERN bipod made in the USA by a reputable company.","Yeah, I like it.","I'm reviewing this at a $74.00 price. At a higher price, I'd probably pull a star. I mean, it's functional, and reasonably sturdy for my needs. My rifle is heavy, but it's more for range and groundhog use, than PRS events. So, it isn't taking that level of abuse from me. But, I like it. The pan and tilt are functional, easily adjustable, and very lockable. leg adjustments are also reasonably easy to make, even under stress, when a violent, psychopathic groundhog is coming straight at you. You know, when you've got to be all operator and such."

I updated to 5 stars until I am able to test the new sight and verify reliability. So far the company has gone above and beyond in customer service. I highly recommend doing business with them. Edit: replacing the batteries seems to have solved the always on issue. Updated to 3 stars. I really wanted to love this optic, and before I mounted it I was hopeful. I noticed it was a little tilted, but based on other comments I thought that would be the case. I was impressed with how bright it is. That's where the good things end. Once it was mounted I noticed that the reticle was always on. I can't turn it off or change the brightness setting, which is set to the lowest setting. Removing the batteries, unmounting, and tapping it seems to do nothing. I would consider this for a toy gun, but nothing more unfortunately. Pros: Inexpensive Clear glass Easy to mount Cons: Tilted crosshairs Reliability",An excellent product,"This is a reflex sight and it is the best one I have seen. It is rugged and has features that the company doesn't mention such as the automatic shut off. The batteries last a very long time and adjustment is very easy. I have taken it to the range several times and find the ridicule to be exactly on target after sighting it in. I turned it off target, both up and down 10 inches, then turned it back to zero. It was exactly on target I can hit 6"" plates at one hundred meters with every shot using a 300 blackout and 110 grain bullets (super sonic). This sight is larger, diameter wise, target acquirement is very easy. I will likely order several more. I didn't realize there was something this good out there for this price. I can not get over how easy it is to use. I would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a good sight. I have several other products from this company and customer service is excellent. I am convinced that this company wants their products to work for you. Two month later...I have been using this, a number of people at the range have used it. No one has anything but good things to say about this sight. It gets on target fast and it's ease of use is excellent. The features addict you to the unit. I am going to be ordering more of them!",Cheap and it works.,"Look, its cheap AF and it works. Anything less than 10 yards and youll get a bit of parallax (Not really bad considering at that range if the reticle is on target your going to at least hit a part of the target anyway). At 10 it shoots a tiny hair above center reticle. Not really an issue if your shooting at anything bigger than a grape. 10+ yards - 25 yards its spot on. Haven't tested it pass that. Shot around 200 rounds and on 2 different days. 1st day was the zero 2nd day was to shoot some more, held zero 2nd day no problems. Im not a super serious ""gun"" guy and I know the only time I will possibly ever use my weapon outside a range is if someones busting into my house trying to put stuff in my butt. Its really cheap for what you are getting and it works. Auto off is really nice, and its super bright. Comes with 2 sets of batteries.",WOW What a pleasant surprise,Well I had an open mind. I had looked this unit up and saw a warning that a astigmatism could cause some blurry issues. But much to my surprise NOPE. I like how you can dial the light of the reticle WAY DOWN for me thats a must. Its a easy on but also easy off the rail for quick range changes. You can change the reticle type and while this may seem not to big a deal it is. And YES Absolute Co-Witness with Iron Sight .....NICE Very nice package job Fast shipping and an all around good product.,Great scope for a great price.,"I just received my Feyachi RS-30 Relex scope today. With my aging eyes my intent was to get a relatively inexpensive red dot scope to mount on my Ruger 1022. I have had some good experiences with a Feyachi’s RDS-22 scope on a Glock 22 fitted with a MCK so I was looking forward to the RS-30. The RS-30 mounted easily to my Ruger’s picatinny rail with the included scope mount. Also included were allen wrenches for installation and adjustment and a complete second set of batteries. Although I have yet to take it to the range, a quick co-witness with the existing metal sights suggests the new red dot is fairly close to zero. For the price the RS-30 has some nice features. There are 4 reticle patterns: dot within a circle, dot within a cross, solitary dot and finally, dot within a circle within a cross. Each of these patterns have 6 brightness settings. Setting 4 seemed the best for me. The pattern is turned on by pressing the on switch. Pressing the switch briefly cycles through the brightness setting. Holding the switch down for a couple of seconds turns off the reticle. Additionally, to preserve battery life, the sight will turn itself off after one hour of inactivity. A nice feature is that the scope remembers your last pattern and brightness setting so when you turn it back on you are set to go. The reticle itself is large and easily lends itself to shooting with both eyes open. If you are hunting this allows you to remain situationally aware while providing a clear sight picture. The fit and finish of the scope itself is beyond expectations, particularly given the price point. I look forward to getting to the range and putting this scope through it’s paces. Given my experience with the RDS-22 I do not anticipate any issues."

I have this on my Spike Tactical ST15 and held up very well, although Ive only put about 100 rounds through with it on. Its a good looking bipod, with spring loaded legs that extend out to about 9 inches. With a 30 round magazine in and my stock extended, the magazine does not touch the ground sitting on the bipod. Seems to be pretty solid, although this decreases slightly the further you extend the legs out. That being said, I had no issues with it moving or flexing when I did shoot with it fully extended. I just found it to be a bit more stable with the legs on the lower levels. Time will tell how it holds up, but so far so good.",For under $20 why wouldn’t you buy this!,So your still on the fence with pulling the trigger on buying this accessory for your rifle... ok let me start with the fact that if the commitment is under $20 you’re not running a huge risk. I decided to order this for my ar-22 just to fulfill my couriosity and let me assure this product exceeded my expectations. It is very sturdy and functional. If I paid more I’d still be pleased with my purchase. The install is simple and the usability is great. If you purchase I think you’re going to be pleasantly pleased and if not just what exactly were you expecting??? You could pay more but that said I’m just not sure what extra value you’d be getting.,Stop whatever you are doing and buy this bipod,"It's $20. It feels like it's worth $80. It works like it's worth $80. Probably wont age like an $80 bipod, but I have it on my 22LR so I see it lasting many years. I'd buy it again.","Low price, works just fine.","Price is great for those who need something for occasional use on a benchtop. Mine did not come with instructions, so if you are reading this, be sure to read further, and look at the pictures in the product photos for the two pages of instructions. If you know your way around mounts, then this is a straightforward installation. If this is your first time, then the bipod has jaws if your firearm has a mounting point for this bipod. Take a look at the rail adapter for the piece you should look for. If you do not have this mounting point and only have a bare rail, then you can use the included adapter to attach the bipod to the rail adapter. The bipod comes with a 'hose piece' placed between the jaws, and the only way to remove it is to loosen the adjuster on the bottom to allow the jaws to move forward to get the hose off. If you have the bipod adapter, then just get the jaws inbetween the holes and tighten. If not, use the adapter, and then rail mount it. Overall, the bipod works just fine. The feet are spring loaded with a tiny spring and they can be positioned at different heights. There are specific increments for the feet position, so if you are on uneven ground, you may not be level. Couple this with there not being any side to side movement, leads me to believe that it would work really well on a benchtop or other similar flat surface, but not as well in the field. It is certainly better than nothing at all though. My only fear is that the tightening screw (the one to tighten the bipod down to the firearm or the rail adapter) may strip at some point, as the threads seem pretty fine, and that the piece holding it on, I could not tell exactly what it is threading into. See pictures for what I mean. While nothing has happened to mine, I will see over time what happens. I plan on using a bunch of thread locker to make sure everything stays where I have it. The rail adapter is robust, and overall the finish is pretty decent for everything. For the cost though, I am happy with putting it on one of my inexpensive firearms. If anybody has any questions or needs more pictures, be sure to ask!",The one to buy...,"I bought this bi-pod for my S&W AR-10, which weighs 9+ lbs w/o mag or ammo or scope or muzzle break, etc, so it's a little heavy. Since this was my 1st bi-pod I didn't want to spend a lot of money until I found out what I really needed, so I decided to go cheap and this was less than $20. Well, it turned out to be made very well and meets all my needs for a table top bi-pod. So I am sticking w/ this, and I even just bought one for my son and his AR-15. I can't say if this is better than everything else out there, but I know it has everything I need, and therefore recommend this highly. My only negative comment is that the instructions are not that clear. Believe it or not, I needed to look on YouTube for instructions to join the base to the legs."

After reading tons of reviews and getting some serious trigger time myself, I've come up with the following observations/recommendations: Feels very real in your hands. Flip up sights are cheap junk and really don't look like they belong on such a great looking rifle. Crossman should really pony up and put some decent flip-up iron sights on this thing. How much could it cost at such volumes? Anyway, I took them off and replaced with cheap red/green dot scope before the first loading. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019MN7N5U/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 After handling his rifle for a few hours now I believe it would be excellent for introduction training for a real AR. All controls work very close to a real AR (except fwd assist which rarely gets used anyway). Trigger is a bit stiff and appears to behave like a 2-stage trigger. At abt 90% of trigger force applied, there's a faint click, then a bit more squeeze and it fires. Not sure if this was an intentional feature but it's very consistent and I like it. At 30 ft, with fresh co2, I'm grouping 25 rnds within an inch in semi-auto (with a rest). Holds elevation pretty well for first 6 mags. Elevation drops 2-3 inches @ 30 ft. on last (7th) mag. When co2 gets low, rifle occasionally does some weird stuff like double firing or dry firing. When co2 gets really low, you have to use the charge lever between shots, but by then it's time to replaced co2 anyway. From what I've heard, to extend the life of the rifle, you shouldn't run full auto with fresh co2 cyls or near empty ones either. Shoot the first mag in semi-auto then switch to full-auto for a couple of mags, then back to semi-auto until co2 is gone. Also, not too much full auto until you have a few hounded rnds thru it. Seems like good advice since moving parts need to wear-in. First 1500 BBs were Hornady Black Diamond since I heard they load easier (and they are). Speed loader takes a little getting used to, but after you get the hang of it, it's great. I spray a little Rem oil in the loader, load it between 1/2 and 3/4 full then another quick spray of oil. Then shake it to distribute the oil around. Switched to Daisy zinc coated BB's since local store was out of Hornady's. They are a little more difficult to load but so far no issues with first 1000 rounds. Daisy grouped as well as the Hornady's. When speed loader plunger jams, don't force it. Just flip it upside down (while still connected to mag) and gently work the plunger until it un-jams, then flip it back upright and continue. At first it didn't seem to shoot more than abt 75-100 rnds before running out of co2 (semi-auto only). When removing right (secondary) cylinder, a LOT of co2 escaped. Inspected piercing pin and it looked OK. Next time removing co2 cylinders, I loosened the right cyl very very slowly. Noticed after abt 1/4 turn loosening, the right cyl got cold but wasn't leaking. I was then able to fire another 75 or so rnds. Next time I loaded 2 new cyls, I tightened the left cyl normally. On the right cyl, I tightened until it was abt as tight as I could get it with the supplied wrench, then backed it off exactly 1/4 turn. Now it works as it should. I've ran 6 cyls thru it this way and so far so good. There's something odd going on inside the mag that makes the right cylinder not flow if cyl is screwed on really tight but this appears to be a good work-around so far. Microscopic manual says to oil after ~1000 rnds. That's what I did. Maybe Crossman wants to parts to wear-in before oiling?? I applied pelgunoil to the co2 tips and everything else that moves including the seal. Feels significantly smoother now. I've heard pelgunoil is actually non-detergent ATF. When the pelgunoil tube runs out, I'll probably refill it with ATF and keep rolling. EDIT: After a hit more research, looks like silicone oil is supposed to be used on the green seal, in the cyl where green seal slides into and on the seal at output of the magazine. I'll be switching over to silicone oil for these parts. Still using pelgunoil for tips of co2 cyls. IMHO, this was a steal at $145. Even at $180 it's still a bargain. I've had a lot of fun with it and actually feel I'm improving my target acquisition time and muscle memory. Hats off to DPMS/Panther Arms/Crossman for releasing such a BB gun.",Outstanding and reliable pellet rifle,"This thing is a beast. It has a quick and snappy fire rate, and the realism makes this gun all the more better. You will find most of the controls in their proper places, all functioning realistically. This gun is also highly versatile. I have fitted it with a plethora of my own attachments to it, which makes it look much more tactical. The only downside is that the primary build material is plastic, but highly durable plastic. I give this behemoth a 9/10.",Great gun ruined by a poor accessory - edited,"I was excited to get this after all the hype I saw online. It arrived and I was all set to try it out, but the speed loader malfunctioned. When depressing the feed shaft it immediately got stuck and would not move. I know about the special attachment to hold the magazine slide back while feeding in the BBs. I have several Airsoft guns and bout eight speed loaders, all work perfectly. This is a problem in manufacture or design, I tried several things to get it to work but it wouldn't. It made loading the magazine very cumbersome, a latch to hold the feed spring back while inserting BBs into the magazine would have been a simple design feature to make loading BBs in simpler. I will contact Crossman to see if there's a fix for the speed loader and maybe I can give this the five stars I would have liked to. With all the time I spent trying to get the speed loader to work it got dark so I wasn't able to shoot it much. Contacted both vendor and Crosman, both gave quick response. Some BBs are larger than others and will not feed as well, Crosman said to add a few drops of airgun oil. After working it a while I can now get it to feed. It appears to be a copy of the Umarex BB speed loader, slight grip shape difference but internals are identical (I took both apart). So now the speed loader works I can happily shoot this gun and it's a lot of fun!",Sick,"I'm quite the novice with this sort of thing, but I'm very impressed with the accuracy, build quality, and overall performance of this rifle. Even at full auto (which I wouldn't recommend using frequently because it eats away at CO2 rather quickly) it's on-point. It comes with an angled foregrip, one magazine, and a BB speedloader. If you're looking for a high-quality BB gun that feels a lot more realistic than most others, then this is the one I'd recommend. It's well worth the money.",Fun Time. Puts a grin to your face,"When they designed and built this SBR they really woke up on the right side of the bed. The weight, looks and workings on the AR look alike is amazing. From the adjusting shoulder stock the magazine the lock back on the bolt the safe, semi auto, FULL AUTO button all on the same side as a regular AR is fantastic. On semi auto it is fairly accurate plinking at pop cans or what have you. On FULL AUTO you'll have that can dancing away and putting a grin on your face from ear to ear Nothing to dislike bout with this SBR, though you get to wishing the mag held more ammo. Definitely recommend this to any one that's looking to have a fun time."

I really am a casual shooter and didn't want to spend a ton of money on one of the big boys so I started to research inexpensive red dots and the best reviews kept coming up for the Bushnell Trophy Red Dot. I figured with all the great reviews where could I go wrong. When I pulled the sight from the box I really liked that it was so small. This way I could add it to my S&W 22A and it really wouldn't change the weight or balance of the gun. Sighting the dot in was a piece of cake, the adjustment knobs are tight and give a positive click when adjusting. You know when you moved it 10 ""clicks"". The On/Off and brightness control are also quite stiff to turn, but it does loosen up a little with use. Lets just say that any of the adjustment knobs are staying where you put them. There is no way to accidentally change any setting on this thing. Once zeroed, this dot never moves. Even after 10000 rounds, this dot has stayed zero and not needed adjustment unless I'm changing the default distance to zero (I usually keep it at 15 yrds). But of course this is a 22 and there really isn't any recoil so it shouldn't move. Let me say that I was so impressed with the sighting ability of this dot I purchased more. In addition to the 22A, I also have one attached to my S&W 15-12, Olympic Arms 9mm sporting carbine, Colt Competition 5.56 and Mossberg 500 12 ga.. That's 5 guns, thousands and thousands of rounds of various caliber and recoil and not one of these TRS-25 red dots has lost zero. They simply stay on target every time. Of course an optical sight is only as good as the optic. I haven't had any of the noted issues with distortion of the dot. Some of my sights have the emitter at the 5 o'clock position and some at the 6. I see no meaningful difference between the two. The dot is crisp and bright indoor or out, bright sun or cloudy day the when set to the proper illumination you will see the dot. The coating on the lense helps to reduce glare and the water proof/fog proof construction keep the view clear in all conditions. Note, on a long gun platform, the dot is quick to acquire and has little parallax issue. On the pistol, unless you practice, quick acquisition is not automatic but then again, I've had this issue with other dots I've placed on my pistols. For bullseye or shooting that doesn't need a fast acquisition, these are ideal but in speed steel, you will need to practice. Overall, this is the best low cost red dot sight out there. For most uses, I would put this sight up against any of the more expensive red dots and feel confident that it would perform. Photos: - S&W 22A (with gold lettering) - Colt Competition (white lettering) with UTG Magnifier.",Read the booklet and you'll be fine.,"Please read the second page of the booklet that comes with the red dot. The lens is supposed to be angled to reflect the laser back towards your eye with the laser already coming at an angle inside the sight. Very easy to laser boar site with it being a green dot at 25 yards. Fits my rifles very well and stays zeroed on larger rounds like an akm with continuous follow up shots. For ""optics ready"" firearms, a riser is not needed, but for firearms with a fixed front sight a riser is required and a UTG mount works great. This is the newer model and it works fine. No dead spots like in other reviews. This product could do better by making the optic itself feel more durable because the initial feel of the product does feel quality, but has that chinenesium quality.",Almost Perfect on my New Ruger PC Carbine !!!,"The very low profile iron sights on the Ruger Carbine are hard for me to use so I decided to get a red dot scope. Wanted something inexpensive but reliable and compact. Looked like the TRS-25 might be the answer. And so far, it is. I've had it to the range twice and shot over 200 rounds with it at 25-50 yards. I also bought the UTG Low Profile (1/2"") Riser Mount just in case the red dot still wasn't high enough for easy sighting. But the TRS-25 sits at the perfect height just above the iron sights and I didn't need the riser at all. So here are my likes and dislikes: Likes: Very compact and light (see photos) Easy on-off knob and elevation/windage adjustments Achieved my zero with only 6 shots Has held zero with no additional adjustments Good tight fit on picatinny rail Very affordable price Crisp, very bright red dot. I never needed to adjust higher than #3 (11 is the brightest) on a fairly bright, but overcast day. Uses the most common and inexpensive battery Dislikes (I'm going to have to be very picky to find any): OK, if I have to ...... The large, white Bushnell logo shows up like a bright neon advertisement sign. I think the newer model is the one with the smaller, gold toned logo like is shown on Amazon. That's the one shown on the Bushnell website too so I presume it's the newest model. But not a big deal. Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase and would recommend the sight to everyone who wants quality but doesn't want to spend hundreds.",WOW! Better than I expected!,"Was a little leary about buying this with all the mixed reviews on the ""new models"". But for 40 bucks...what the heck. Bushnell must have listened to all the bad press, and made changes. First the emitter is in the 5oclock position, the dot was nice and bright (easily visible outside in bright snow on the 11 setting), the dot was visible everywhere in the tube (non of the reported dissappearing dot in certain parts of the tube), the clicks on the windage, elevation & brightness are very very positive. The lettering is gold on he box, but white on the unit. The glass is superb..crystal clear...with out any green that I can detect! Overall you can tell that this is a quality unit, made to last.......Way out classes it price tag. May even buy a second.....If your looking for a quality red dot optic and don't have hundreds to spend this is the one! Update: Don't worry about the white lettering...this is the 3.0 version. The original was the gold, then the hit or miss white, this version is spot on Perfect. Everything the old gold one was. VALUE VALUE Value....I'm buying a two more. Lastly..to those who are not seeing the dot as a perfect circle, oblong, or star burst. You most likely have astigmatism...either un diagnosed (this is a really well known side effect with red dot sights), or with out proper corrective lenses. I have that and when viewed with out my corrective lenses, all the dot sights look distorted. When I put them on, the dot returns to normal. Worth looking into you have problems seeing the dot correctly IMHO",Amazing product for the price!,"For the price this red dot is amazing. Penny for penny it is better than my Vortex and my Eotech. Zeroed at 50 yards in no time at all. Has held zero just fine over a few hundred rounds. Install could have been easier but that's really kind of nit-picking. To those complaining that they don't work -- you do realize that you have to remove the clear plastic shield that keeps the battery from making contact until the scope is ready to be used, right? Yes this isn't in the instructions but seriously, how hard is that to figure out? Could the dot be a little more crisp? Maybe. Could it be a little brighter? Maybe. But when you consider the price, what exactly are you expecting? It is bright enough to see in the bright Arizona sun and the dot is crisp enough to drill headshots at 100 yards without much trouble. If you're on a budget, buy with confidence. If you're expecting the same performance as a scope that costs hundreds more, then take a big swig of reality and save your money."

Took me 6 shots at 15yrds out of my savage A22lr and I'm dead on. It takes so careful thinking between shots to dial it in.

It also came with the Allen wrench to install and adjust it, along with a set of batteries. Looked nice and packaged very nice. At this time I was thinking why would someone pack a cheap made sight this nice. I installed it on my gun, bore sighted it at 10 yds, moved out to 20 yds. Dead on at 20. Two days ago I had a major upset. My pistol fell over in my safe. I figured that the sight was probably shot from the hit that it took. A couple of shots from the back porch proved me wrong.

So when I first turned it on and seen that the dot was more of a cluster I thought something can't be right. I'm a newbie to red dot sights, but I heard mention of different eye types affecting how the dot looks. Soon into my online search I found a guy posting about having the same issue with every sight he had and sharing ways to tell if it's you or the sight. Easiest way was looking through a hole in a peice of paper which will lesson the distortion caused by astigmatism. Or do what I did and look through the small peep on your rear sight with cowitness setup. Sure enough when doing so it was a nice small crisp dot.

It's so sensitive I can stomp on the floor next to a table my gun is lying on, and it will activate. The obvious advantage is you don't have to fool with it, you can just set-it-and-forget-it like iron sights. 2 minutes after you set the gun down, it's off again. That's nice, because you can go a solid 5 years between batteries. Plus it's as tough as my Aimpoint, which costs four times what I paid for this. Win-Win. UNLESS you mount this to a patrol gun that rolls around in a car all day. It will smoke your battery in record time. LEOs be warned. That's really the only disadvantage I could find, everything else about this optic is pretty wonderful."

It looks gorgeous (I bought cream), takes apart and puts together easily, is study when baby tries pulling up on it. I actually have it split in two and covering our TV centers, but have it wedged in the corners and at right angles to keep it sturdy. I read some reviews saying the edges are sharp: mine are NOT. I've rubbed my own fingers against it, and the babe has grabbed onto it to pull up, with no issues.",Good pen for small dogs,"I got this to temporarily hold our rescue pup while we replace the carpet in the living room (destroyed while house training...) She is a 17 lb BT and the height of the panels is good for her size. Anything shorter she would have tried to jump. It sort of grips/suctions to the wood floor, but if you have someone who jumps or pushes, it will slide. We set it up in the middle of the kitchen so if she pushes, she wont get far. The (width) distance on the left and right of the pen is 6 ft, 10 inches. It is easy to open/close. I am 5 ft, 1 inch, and I prefer to step over though, so she doesnt try to run. I also bought the 2 extra panels, but the 6 are big enough for a small sized dog who is staying in the pen for a short time.",Fantastic and safe design for you precious little ones!,"The media could not be loaded. First off let me say that Evenflo hit a huge home run with this play space (or as my 10 year old son calls it, ""baby jail). The single biggest feature that my wife and I love is that each part of the webbing is a rounded edge and not a sharp plastic edge. We have no worry about our daughter hurting her hands or feet on this fencing due to the awesome rounded edges of the plastic. In the classic octagon shape it is 5ft across by 4ft 10"" across from the two opposite corners and the two opposite straight edges of the octagon. This gives a large enough space for your baby to crawl and maneuver around and explore the area safely. Each panel of the play space is held together with a simple and effective push button hinge design. The fencing can be easily taken apart by an adult and reconfigured in a matter of seconds yet is completely secure enough where a baby or toddler would be unable to separate the fencing. The webbing on each panel is small enough where a baby/toddler in the standing stage would be unable to effectively place their foot into the opening and climb. My daughter is nearly 9 months and is able to pull herself up and is starting to explore things with her feet while she is holding herself up. Her hands are completely unharmed due to the awesome rounded edges on the webbing. The angled design of the webbing also prevents little feet from being able to climb up the panel. The play space easily folds up for storage. Think of an accordion style where each fence panel folds over onto the other. You simply detach one corner from the adjoining panel by pushing the white button on top of the joint and the fence folds up easily. You can really tell Evenflo put a lot of thought into the design of this play space. It is well worth every penny spent. Please click YES down below if you found this review helpful. If you have any questions or would like additional pictures please feel free to ask. Thank you!",It keeps large dogs from scratching doors!,"I purchased this Evenflo baby gate because we purchased a new home and don’t want our large dogs (136 pounds being the heaviest) scratching the paint and wood of the doors at the nice house like they have done at our old house. The gate comes in 6 sections of panels with a connecting hinge between each, so it can completely encircle something. There is a white “button” or mechanism on the top of the hinge that you have to press really hard and then muscle it apart. If I had to find a critique about this baby gate, it would be that it is difficult to disassemble. For me, I only had to do it twice (once for each section), so it wasn’t a problem. The hinges snap to a variety of positions, which makes them very stable. If they didn’t snap to the different angles, they would be easier to collapse by putting pressure on the corners or sides. I was able to use the one gate I ordered to form a barrier around the single side porch door, and the remaining four panels to surround the double back doors. The panels are tall enough that the dogs see it as a barrier, and it was easy to train them to avoid it, but short enough that I can lean over it to put food down. The gate is light and stable enough that I can reposition it with one hand without it collapsing. Overall, we are extremely satisfied with our purchase and highly recommend this Evenflo pet/baby gate. 5/5 stars",So great for new puppy!,"There are 8 pieces that form a ""playground"". Any two pieces can function indiviually. My main floor is an open floor plan. I can use two to close off the dining room and two to close off the kitchen, or 4 to close off the family room which leaves the kitchen family room together. Photo shows two pieces giving 9 week old puppy some privacy from 11 month old puppy while he eats. Yes, the big dog could break in, but he is trained to sit and stay. Even the puppy can move these pieces if they aren't strategically placed, but they are easy to manipulate to many uses. I don't know how I could deal with active puppy without this. Truly love it!"

I needed a big space for my son to safely do tummy time without my Great Pyrenees licking his face or pawing at him. Not to mention grabbing his toys and then having to chase her down and wash the toy afterwards (she is still in the puppy phase). Now that my son is crawling everywhere it also helps to have a space for him to safely venture in while I do quick little tasks without worrying about him getting into something that he shouldn't be. It is sturdy and was very easy to put together. It is huge and takes up a lot of space but I knew that before getting it. The sacrifice of space is well worth it in my opinion.,Great for multiples!,This works great for my 6 month old twins and is big enough for my 4 year old and I to play with them also. It was pretty simple to assemble and seems sturdy when my 4yo hangs all over it. Must have for multiples!,Couldn't live without this!,"The media could not be loaded. This pen is AMAZING! It's super big so it gives my baby a ton of space to crawl around! I made a ""comfy"" section in his where he can lay and relax and drink bottles. Then he has his ""play"" side with all his toys and the included basketball hoop and balls! The balls are super colorful and there are plenty of them! There are 2 zip doors diagonally across from eachother which is awesome. It also comes with 4 ""handles"" that you can hang on the side, and as soon as my son found those, he IMMEDIATELY learned to stand! He'd never stood up on his own before, and now he stands on EVERYTHING, even without the handles, and he's only 9 months old! This item is literally helping to teach him how to walk! So cool! He also leans against the netting A LOT. And I thought FOR SURE he was going to rip right through it and ruin the playpen. But nope! It's SO durable! I just love this thing. I really don't know what I would do without it! It allows me to wash dishes and put him down in it, and not have to worry about what he's getting into! And the MOST important thing of all? My baby ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!! Anything that can keep him out of trouble AND HAPPY at the same time, is a win for me! Would highly recommend!!",A Must Have!,"My 11-month-old absolutely loves this pen! 1) For starters, it helps to keep all of his toys in one place; no need for clean-up. 2) He’s learning to pull himself up and practices walking around the pen. I can tell he’s getting stronger. 3) He feels safe and has even taking a few baby steps inside of it. And I feel great knowing he’s safe and can’t get into trouble. 4) You can play inside the pen with your little one. 5) You can wipe it clean using a damp cloth with soap. The only thing I would advise is if you have hardwood or laminate flooring, add a cushioned floor mat underneath for maximum safety and cushioning. A definite must-have. It’ll take up a lot of room but 100% worth it.",Fun and safe! Nice price!,The kids had fun it held up even when they went over the top a couple times so I would definitely safe it’s safe doesn’t feel like it would fall apart at all. Took me about 20-30 minutes to put together once I seen the layout I don’t even need the instructions to assemble. Will look into more products from this seller!

Fairly easy to put together, although I did have to have my husband help me with the last piece… It takes shear man strength to connect the last remaining piece, as it’s based on tension. Other than that, it’s very well-made, and perfect for busy toddlers! Worth every penny",So far so good!,"I surprisingly like this playpen! It's huge.. which is a positive, but super important to measure your space before buying. After reading some of the reviews I did end up purchasing a mattress topper that I put underneath for padding. Otherwise, whatever floor is underneath will be your pad, and in my case our house is all wood. Knowing that I can put my 8 month old in a safe place if I need to just run to the restroom is so reassuring. We also do a lot of playtime when not exploring and my son seems to like the space.. definitely enough room for an adult and child. You can fit more but not comfortably. Lastly, the durability is impressive. I have cats and they have already scaled the sides without any damage whatsoever. Definitely worth the purchase!"

I ordered a 3 inch foam mattress topper and it fits perfectly. This is the one I ordered - Sure2Sleep Cool Gel Swirl Memory Foam Mattress Topper Made in USA 3-Inch (Full) Play pen came packaged well. Very easy to assemble. It's light but very sturdy so it can be moved around if needed. The bottom pieces have suctions which attach very well but I have a rug so it doesn't matter for me. Def needs a mattress topper for the inside. If you have enough room for this play area def get it. Pack and plays are little cages. My child is 8 months and a climber! She is all over the place. We do mat time in the evenings and I would have to watch her like a hawk - no time to relax! But with this thing I put her in I grab some pillows and I jump in with her. I am 5'1 I fit perfectly. 2 adults can be inside and there will be plenty of room for a baby/child to play. It's the size of a full size bed - literally. My child has enough room to crawls, stand, play, nap, and do whatever she wants and she doesn't feel caged in! She doesn't complain to get out of the area like she did with the pack and play. She just does her thing in there. But the best part I yes I do not have to watch her like a hawk!!!! I can lay down, watch tv, talk on the phone, etc... do whatever I need.

Then he could crawl and it was over there was nothing that could contain him. He can unhinge baby gates, unlock the child safety locks on cabinets if Carter wants in or out he will accomplish that.

It’s the size of a full size bed which I love because if I’m making dinner he maybe in there for a bit. The connections could be a little stronger because my husband is average size and leaned on it (he knows it was dumb) and broke 2 connectors.

We have two dogs and I had all sorts of flimsy plastic gates set up before, that were hard to maneuver around and were not sturdy for her to pull up on. Before I got this play pen, I had to break down her play mat and put her toys away every single night and was constantly cleaning everything of dog hair. I will deal with a giant play pen in my living room if it means I can relax a bit more everyday! It’s nice because we can still move it around a bit with all of her toys still in it, it’s sturdy, and it’s nice looking. My daughter hated being put in her pack n play because she felt enclosed - I can leave her in this and she has plenty of room to roam and I can get in it with her too. This is definitely worth the extra expense!"

This playpen is perfect for keeping him safe in his swing and as we start tummy time soon, and of course he’s going to grow with it. We live in military housing so our living room is quite small and this surprisingly fits great and is super flexible to make any shape you want. It suctions great and comes assembled already. Very happy with our purchase!",This playpen is awesome!,"We are so happy with this playpen! It is massive but that is exactly what we wanted! Our 7 month old son just started crawling so we are overjoyed that he has a large safe space to crawl around and play. My husband put it together himself in less than 30 mins and had no issues. We really like that there were no screws involved for assembly and that it can fold which makes it easier to store and transport. Another added bonus is that we can open any side with one hand and use it as a doorway to come and go as we please. It is very stable, well made, and durable. After looking at a ton of different playpens and reading loads of reviews, I was skeptical but I am glad we ended up pulling the trigger and purchasing this one!",A life saver for working parents!,"When my son started crawling, my wife and my life got insanely complicated during day time when both of us had to work our full time jobs and tend to our son who for some unexplainable reason loves to crawl to corners and to the stairs. Running after him had become frustrating especially when we both had meetings all day. We looked through many play pens online to find one that was big enough that he wouldn't feel claustrophobic and was easy to setup and more importantly something that we could easily take apart and store away when we needed the space to entertain family and guests AND bring back in when we were too busy to attend to the baby. This is the only one we could find that met out expectations. The initial setup took about 30mins. The assembly instructions were just okay and we made a few mistakes that took a bit longer to correct but eventually we got it figured out. Once the initial setup was complete we could easily fold the entire pen and store away in out coat closet. It needs about 4ftx3ftx3ft space to store the folded play pen. Once unfolded, we got a 6ftx6ftx2.5ft enclosure that can hold 2 adults and a baby and some choice toys quite comfortably. Our son loved it right off the bat and he keeps busy within the pen by himself. He has plenty of space to crawl around. We can now focus on our jobs and don't have to worry about him hurting himself. The pen itself is very sturdy and very well built. The padding and fabric part is also of high quality with make this worth every penny. There are a few downsides that are not deal breakers but worth mentioning. I wish that the pen came with a base. We bought another padded foldable base that cost about an additional $80. The folding of the pen needs us to unlink any one joint and ""unlock"" the remaining joints to fold. The unlinking is not as simple as the video shows. It takes a bit of messing around to detach the joint but once done, it is very easy to fold. My solution to this was to not link the bottom part of one joint with makes it infinitely easier to detach that joint. The tradeoff is that the one joint is still not as sturdily held together but it still holds well enough to not bend or buckle or shift. Overall this is a very worthy investment to keep our child safe and active and gives us enough piece of mind to focus on our work. I highly recommend this foldable play pen!",Buy this now...,Quick points: Suction power : 1-5 stars it’s a10 stars Sturdiness : 5 I think you’d be hard pressed to find one more sturdy Assemble: My husband assembled with no curse words and that’s saying something 🤣 IF you are using for its real purpose a play pen I would get it those foam puzzle pieces or put it on a rug as the bottom is just a piece of the fabric it’s made out of. That’s a QUEEN SIZE MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS IN THERE! My son had reflux and all kind of issues when he was a newborn and slept horrible we started co-sleeping and it evolved to me sleeping with the mattress on the floor with my son. this thing is an answered prayer. I’m ready to start trying to let him sleep alone because I think I am disturbing his sleep but before I was worried about him falling off his bed....Not anymore! One less excuse not to try sleep training again. I would say it is definitely in my top 2-3 purchase since he has been born...boppy lounger is #1 but this might edge it out! PUT THIS IN YOUR CART NOW,You have peace of mind for your baby’s safety.,I purchased this playpen for my 10 month old grandson. My daughter loves it because she was able to put the playmates in it as well as most of the toys. My grandson has started to walk and this playpen offers the space for him to be able to freely walk but still be safe. My daughter and my son-in-law have actually got in the playpen with the baby and there was still plenty of room!! The playpen is sturdy and does not bend or buckle when my grandson pulls up on it. Very happy with the product.

I had purchased a graco model similar to this when I had my first, and the thing was a total pain. The buttons to get the sides to release we’re terrible to push, and there was no safety to keep the bottom down. With the baby trend, the releases are extremely easy to pull, (but you can’t pull them unless the bottom is up, so safe from accidental collapsing by little ones) and the bottom actually locks down and then there’s a handle you twist and release and it basically pulls itself up for you! Overall better quality than Graco, and much much easier to assemble and use. (And not to mention about $20 cheaper than the exact same thing from Graco)",Great Value,"Excited to use, cute and durable and everything I needed for a simple sleep spot for a newborn and can take the bassinet out to grow with the baby.","So Cute, Sturdy, and Easy to Operate","Such a cute, sturdy pack and play for my grandkids. Super easy to put together if you read the directions...I’ll save you the effort; be sure the center is unlocked and fully lifted to lock the sides and THEN put the bottom down and lock it. The only bad reviews I saw on this were ease of operation but I knew it was probably because people didn’t read and I was right. Super easy. You’ll love it and it’s a great price. Love having the higher bassinette section while they are so tiny."

The door lock is a little difficult from the outside without 2 hands which I love and hate. It’s great when the baby is locked in and the toddler can’t get in but not great when I’m holding that baby trying to get in! Super sturdy, keeps 5 very large dogs out and it’s high enough that they can’t jump it (not without a good running start at least). It comes in a bazillion pieces so it’s a bit of a pain to put together. Easy enough to do without instructions. Haven’t used the suction cups since it’s on top of a rug. We also didn’t fully enclose the gate and left a section open since it’s directly in front of the couch and we needed a place to sit! The gate is still plenty sturdy because of how we configured it. Super easy to do.",A Parenting must have!!,I have 4 kids and just found this for my last baby (7 months) and its brilliant! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. Putting it together was fairly simple once I realized how to read the instructions. Its super sturdy and I only gave easy to fold a 3 because i haven't figured out how to do it yet without taking it all apart. Definitely consider this a must have especially if you have older wild children and awkward stairways that gates dont fit like I do. It was worth every cent.,LOVE IT!!!!,"I love this! It didn’t come with instructions, but it was very easy to figure out & put together. This is definitely the cutest one I’ve come across while still being gender neutral & not being an eye sore. I love the ocean theme! It’s super sturdy, no way my daughter can pull anything off to injure herself or be a choking hazard. & I especially love that it folds up so that it doesn’t have to take up an entire room when it’s not being used. I did a lot of research before choosing a playpen & I’m so happy with my purchase!",Nice design and Easy to assemble,"The baby is just one year old, the age to learn to climb and how to walk. It is my concer to protect him from hurting himself when he is trying and learning. So, I found this product. Good design, easy to assemble, can be made according to their own needs and also have a learning wall, space is also relatively large. I must say, with it I am no longer worry about him might hurt himself when running around. Also, that’s my favorite color.",Perfect!,I did a lot of research on this before buying and seemed like the best one. It had no smell and it was pretty easy to assemble. It looked like a lot of pieces at first but it really wasn’t. We have hardwood floors so the suction works really well.

Previous comments about edges being sharp did not apply,"We bought two-six panel systems. My wife was worried after reading previous reviews about the plastic being sharp and potentially hurting our LO. There were no issues! We purchased 12 panels total to have some flexibility in our configuration. Manufacture says no more than eight panels can be put together. Technically you could put as many as you want together, but I wouldn't be comfortable having a straight run of more than two panels long. Plus an eight panel square (2x2) configuration worked perfect with the 6'x6' play mat we got. For the price and the results this is an excellent baby prison.",Very Happy with Purchase,"It came folded up in a box. All I had to do was pull it out and shape it into a square. They show it set up as an octagon. I was using it over interlocking foam pieces. The two fit perfectly together. I wish that the two interlocking sections made for an easier ""gate"", but I'm still very happy about this purchase. We step over it, to enter, which may be a deterrent for someone short or physically challenged. I find it to be sturdy and after a month have not had any concern with it breaking or being sharp on the edges. Folding the sections back up does require some "" force"" whereas, you may feel like it will break, but it hasn't. Overall, we love it and my grandson is able to play. Otherwise, we can't take our eyes off of him and it's difficult to get things done or sit and relax. We have an open floor plan, so it fits in our main living area. I liked that it doesn't require tools to install on the wall. We can see him playing and he knows we are nearby, but we're not having to watch him every second to know that he is safe. If you have the space and a mobile baby or toddler, it gives one peace of mind. Everyone is happy.",Excellent for baies,"Our savior for many months! We are working first time parents, there are a ton of things we need to take care of while living in our small apartment. This gate came in as a big help. We made a play area for our baby which was safe. She could crawl, sleep, play in her play area which was safe (no cables, wires, tv near by). We used this since our baby was about 4-5 months old until 11-12 months, when she started to get too restless inside the play pen. She learnt to stand up on her own with the help of the gates, earlier than other kids of her age. She started to take steps holding on to these gates. When she was 11 months old, she started climbing up the gate, thats when we stopped using it. Overall a good product. No issues with quality.",Favorite Buy for my Toddler!!,"This has been the most amazing product we have bought for our toddler! It is big enough that he has plenty of room for his toys, his little ride on car, and room for him to run around, his 7 and 10 year old brother even get in there and tussle around with him all the time. My son Killian is currently 18 months and walking around and its so nice having a safe place for him to play (still with supervision of course) while mommy does dishes or folds laundry or just anything! while it isn't the lightest thing in the world it is portable and we have taken it with us to the lake and to various gatherings and its worked out great, when we were using it outdoors and the ground was a little less than even we actually used thin tent stakes and pinned it down at a couple points for extra sturdiness. We definitely love our ""Killy corral"" as we call it and recommend it to anyone looking for a good Play yard.","Large, safe area to allow baby to explore and move around without feeling boxed in.","UDATE❗️04/29/2021, Still “like” mainly cute, roomy BUT.........it is VERY WOBBLY, and DOES NOT OPEN EASILY AS STATED, almost feels as fixed or glued - now worried it MAY NEVER OPEN at entry panel without breaking it! As a grandmother (72 yrs old) I can not safely climb over but bet your last $$ if needed I will roll or dive over the fence if needed to get to my grandson! LOL! It is NOT THICK OR HEAVY DUTY PLASTIC AS ADVERTISED, very light weight, I could “probably” pick it up and crawl under it if necessary. My little Chiweenie dog moves them when she tries to stand up on them. AND YES THEY ARE INSTALLED AND LOCKED IN PLACE AS DIRECTED. So Heads up!! Be aware, time will tell durability. Will update again when he gets to point of pulling himself up and holding on to walk around. you need more honesty in advertisement. Made in USA is 50% of reason purchased. The other my grandson loves playing in identical one at his home so far. However, there is another one almost identical, a few dollars cheaper, my other daughter purchased (😤 made in China tho) it is heavier, thicker plastic that is sturdier! What a shame 🇺🇸 Can’t match 🇨🇳 in same quality on this particular product. I always try to go USA made, but am finding quality or durability problems. I am concerned First review below when first set This review is for the Toddleroo 8 panel playyard. I really like this so far! Just put it up today. Very cute, bright, like the primary colors. My daughter bought one a couple weeks ago for my 9 month old grandson and he loves rolling around the spacious area, he hates his pac and play, to confining I think. He is learning to crawl and explore so he needs to be carefully monitored. Every little thing goes into his mouth, he is like a little Pac-Man trying to chew on everything he sees. So I bought one for him too! It does shake a bit, but do not see how it could ever fall over due to the size and design. It is harder to unfold for a set that was pre-assembled. (I had help). A couple of the anti-slip pads for the floor crumbled when peeled off the paper backing. You will probable need extra which you should be able to get locally. There are a couple sharp plastic edges/ points on the rails of 1 panel, plan to try to file these. Minor fix. Haven’t folded it back up yet, so can only guess, since it was a bit awkward to install. But by no means a game changer."

My daughter is 1 year old and she is regular height. Her arm got stuck between the gaps. Had she tripped while it was still stuck her arm would have snapped(see screenshots). After this happened I checked reviews and couple of customers already mentioned the same. I am not sure why amazon is tagging this product as ""Amazon Choice""? The seller also did not change the design even after customers complained. Amazon should stop selling this product until seller fixes the issue. I temporarily fixed it by putting the anti-skid buckle on the top(see screenshot) but now the playpen skids. Pros: # The playpen is decent size (76x46) and it covers Large size 82.7 x 55.1 inches Baby Care Play Mat (https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Care-Play-Foam-Floor/dp/B0058K5IIQ/) # Seller claims product is BPA free, non-toxic and non-recycle material with HDPE, no any odor. # Bright colors # Quality looks good and panels are sturdy. Cons: # Gaps are huge and it is very risky. Update: I contacted the seller and asked for 15 extra anti skid buckles which the seller has immediately sent. Now I have enough buckles to put on top and bottom. In order to secure the buckle on top I have put double foam tape so that my daughter doesn’t pull them out. Now the playpen doesn’t skid and I also closed the gaps. I am happy with what I have but I would like seller to fix the problem permanently. I also compared Uanlauo playpen with this one and this is better in size and sturdiness. Uanlauo is safe but it moves a lot and it is small.",Large and simple,"I was very nervous when this arrived without any instructions, but it's so easy to set up It really didn't need any. It is lightweight, but sturdy. It really is easy to reconfigure into any box shape. The panels are interchangeable and can be connected straight or at a 90° angle to each other. When they are connected straight, they are not as sturdy, so the kit includes two stabilizing pieces to keep them in the straight position. One is in the middle and one is at the bottom edge. The bottom stabilizer also has rubber grip on the bottom, which slightly reduces how much the whole pen can move. When set up, this pin is large enough to hold a baby jumper and a baby play mat.","Amazing, we love it!","I am so glad I made this purchase! The first 5 months of her life her play area was in an inflatable pool, but with six dogs they wanted to be in there with her and easily jumped inside. This play pen makes sure she is always protected If I have to walk away. The fun and vibrant colors are attractive and it easily fits anywhere I need I need to put it. The orange non slide pieces are great for making the play pen more secure and prevent panels from shifting. We put them on the joints instead of on the actual panel (see photos). The only thing I really wish was different was the door handle. I wish it was higher and only needed one hand to open. The last picture is missing 2 panels because we needed more room for other things until after the holidays, but we will use them again as soon as holidays are over. Overall I am so glad I bought this, best investment so far!",Just buy it!! Many others have failed before I tried this one!,"I've had other enclosures with my older daughter which she successfully would break out of by forcing it over with all her might and all gates failed with her I didn't want the same failing 6 panel enclosures with my newest little one. My four year old who is the size of a 6 year old can and does step over the panels into it but they don't give or fail when she does it. My eleven month old has been using this the past 2 months and she is always content when she's in there she's learned to cruise using the walls, she plays peek a boo in the hearts and she doesn't feel ""trapped"" in there she still feels like she's just in the room with the rest of us. She has a clear view and it's not a caged in feel. With that said I did set it up using other furniture to give a larger play area since her big sister and even myself are often in there playing with her. The walls are sturdy, I like the extra supports that go around in all the panels. I read reviews of the panels splitting and I put the panels together carefully but didn't have any issues with the plastic or the walls splitting. Every negative review I read prior to making my purchase had not been the case for me and I've been 100% satisfied with the purchase. Only thing for me is once it's up, its up. Yes it wouldn't be too much trouble to take apart but it's not something I would want to do or move it around. I've attached a pic of the girls playing inside and you can see just how much space there is for play with the way we have it set up. I tend to not use the door and step right over the wall when I need to go in and out but it does have a door and a play wall. If you're unsure just go ahead and get this one. I did a TON of research shopping for this before deciding on it alot of others have a similar design but they're easier for kids to climb and I've spent a lot of money on many I wasn't pleased with and this so far has by far been the best!",A complete kind of product,"- Good build quality. Sturdy and stable. - Good colors. - A door that open from outside for parents. - Interactive parts in one of wall parts like abacus, wheel, horn, etc. - They have listened to customer feedback (you can get an idea from older reviews), and that is why I got pieces included which fit in the places some users had complained that their children's arms got stuck. We never had that issue because the parts were included. - Our baby learned to stand up on his own by holding on to one of the walls the very first day! - Easy to assemble and dissemble if needed. - As the baby got older, we felt that he needed more space but we still use this pen! We opened it up, and the sides stand together on their own as a barrier, and the last part is used as a wall at a different place in the hall. So, in combination with a couple of baby gates, this play pen helped us give our baby a large area to roam safely. - All in all, very satisfied with this product. Kudos to the makers, sellers, etc."

I've been needing a playpen for a couple months but just couldn't make myself spend that much when in reality I'll probably only use it for a few months because babies grow so fast. But I wish I would have got it sooner. I recieved this as a gift from my sister because I've been talking about it for weeks and it's great. Seems to be just as good quality as a name brand. It did have a odd smell when i first opened it but it quickly went away. I recommend!,Gets the job done,"For the price and lack of reviews, this was a gamble. But it has been a blessing in the month that we've had it. Very easy for travel, slightly smaller than other play yards but not by very much. Keeps our little one contained when we need him to be. Looks good, and holds up against climbing/drooling/biting.",Great playpen,"Great for traveling, but you'll need a mattress to go in because the one it comes with is too h as rd and uncomfortable for a toddler. Otherwise its beautiful and meets its description",Short.,I love this pack n play. Its shorter than the name brand ones u find in store but feels more sturdy and I'm short as hell so it makes laying the baby down easy. We got this and bought a mattress for it because my 8 month old kept hitting his head and getting limbs stuck in the mini crib. This is wider than the portable mini cribs. Love it. So worth the money. After 4 boys I've bought so many pack n plays and I'm truly impressed. This is number 7 on pack n plays for us.,Quick setup,"I loved the easy and quick setup. Best playpen I’ve gotten out of 3 kids. The white mattress was bought separately, but it comes with its own thin mat. Glad I have something to travel with and a safe place to put my baby downstairs."
