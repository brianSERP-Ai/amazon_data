My previous pair was Jessica Simpson, so I was happy to find another great pair from her line! I love the ""fur"" lining on the top, very cozy looking. They are warm and soft in the toes. The sole of the slipper also has fur, but it has already flattened out (I work from home so I'm wearing these for a good part of the day). It would be nice to have more padding on the sole. Probably not the best choice for someone who needs arch support or has flat feet. BUT for me, these work very well and are very comfortable, especially when I wear socks with them! They work for what I use them for - around the house and keeping my feet warm.",I got the black ones; size 9-10 and the purple size 8-9,"I love my house shoes (I only wear them in the house) they did loosen up after about 3wks but they still look good. I really like the faux fur it's soft, I will be repurchasing them.UPDATE: My right foot slipper came apart at the bottom. The padding came out after 6 months which isn't bad to me. The left foot slipper is still in good shape, but I just bought the purple ones in a large because they will loosen up alot. The XL was flying off my feet sometimes lol.",So frickin comfy!!,Seriously I have bought 3 pairs of these and will continue to buy them when my current pair is worn out. The first week or so is the best because they are so fluffy and warm. After a while they get more flat and less comfy but that's expected and it's always worth getting a new pair! My favorite slippers I have ever owned!,Amazed,These are super soft and cozy. I‚Äôm glad I got them. I was a little worried about sizing since I wear a 10.5 shoe. I was worried the shoe size for the extra large was suggested up to 9.5 and want sure they‚Äôd fit but they fit with extra space. I‚Äôd say up to size 11 feet would be fine with these.,Cute and Comfy!,"Supper cute and comfortable, extremely soft inside..my wide feet fit them great,I order an XL and wear size 9 (womens US)..I feel like they wouldn't be a good fit for anyone with bigger feet though,heels might end up hanging off the back lol üòÖ which is kinda sad because all size feet should be aloud to enjoy these lol üòÑ‚ù§Ô∏è I added a picture of the back to show how much room is left with size 9 feet",1539,140,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HQVKSBJ

I work in a school office and am at my desk about half the day. I‚Äôm also a big guy with back problems. This chair is perfect. It looks nice, too. I had a bungee chair before this, but after 10+ years it broke. This new bungee chair is even more comfortable than my old model. Definitely happy with this purchase and will recommend.",Solid Chair for the Price,"Incredibly simple to put together, and more comfortable than I was expecting. The bungees are very firm and only have enough give to envelope you. They are not saggy at all. The tilt feature is nice and it leans pretty far, only difficulty is actually getting the chair to lean. You really have to commit to putting your weight backwards. So you can‚Äôt really comfortably lean while still keeping your hands at the desk.As far as the sturdiness of the chair is concerned, I just purchased but all components seem well crafted and seem as though they will pass the test of time. I‚Äôll update if anything changes.I think I still prefer my steelcase chair at the office over this, but all in all, very nice chair and happy with the purchase.",Amazing!!!,I am 5FT 5 and weigh 125lbs. The chair is super spacious. My significant other weighs about 170lbs and is 5ft 11 and fits him comfortably. He has the same chair and it‚Äôs still going strong after 5 years. The bungee is solid and self adjusts comfortably my spine. This chair is great for more than 5 hours + of sitting and gaming. Assembly is easy. The main washers come built into the chair and you have to bring it down. I prefer this chair over a Herman Miller Aeron which I‚Äôve used for 2 years +at my office.,Better than HM Aeron,"I have a bad back and need to sit in a desk chair a lot for work, which can be uncomfortable. My last desk chair was a Herman Miller Aeron.This chair is immeasurably more comfortable than the Aeron. The HMA seat is made of a taught woven nylon that, though it is just stretched fabric, felt too hard for me. I could not sit in that chair for hours on end, and even found myself swapping it for another chair from a coworker, and that was a $39 special from Staples.On this Italmodern chair, the bungees work beautifully. The bungees are spaced so that you don't feel them individually, unless it occurs to you (as it did to me, with a sense of relief) how they give when you move and in the back of your mind you expect some discomfort you're used to - and it's not there.The chair's build quality is excellent. Assembly was straightforward and easy. You undo four screws and put the bottom support on the seat bottom. Insert the center post to the caster bottom, then the seat onto that, all without tools. Everything fits precisely. You slide the back into place, attach the two armrests with two screws apiece (allen keys included), two safety screws to hold the back on, and you're done. No wrangling with difficult assembly.Controls all work correctly. Rubber on armrests feels good beneath bony elbows.The only thing that peeves me about this purchase is that the black was so much more expensive than any of the other colors, but that's the way of the world, and as mercenary as that may be, it's not a reflection on an excellent product.",Comfy Office Chair with Style,"Purchased two of these chairs for the home office.

I feel okay saying that here, but I know it's not something I should use to head off a profile on, say, Tinder or OKCupid. ""OINTMENTLOVER69."" Nope. Most people can't even stand the WORD ""ointment."" If I recall, ""moist"" and ""ointment"" were voted America's Least Favorite Words Of The Past 100 Years, or something like that.ANYway, I grew up surrounded by Vaseline, and A&D, and Desitin, and Hydrocortisone, and my very very favorite of all (you can feel it coming, I bet) Vicks Vap-O-Rub, like a beautiful teeny jar of winter night itself. Those products of my overprotected, well-moisturized youth felt reliable and timeless to me, and when I finally acquired a boyfriend, David, in my 20's, I discovered that he shared my love of classic unguents, and many a cold Minnesota night the two of us went to bed liberally slathered in mentholating, virus-killing, chap-preventing goo, eventually becoming glued to each other in our sleep, smelling like a nursing home.It was...everything I wanted.That relationship ended, though, long ago, after we'd moved first to Columbus, Ohio, and then to Seattle, and I don't know if I'll ever completely get over it. There's so much I miss about David, and there's things I find in the world as I go through my life that really only he would appreciate. Like, I wish we could talk about Neosporin Pain Relief Dual Action Ointment -- lying in bed on a lazy Saturday morning, or over pancakes at IHOP, and discuss whether it's ACTUALLY relieving pain as it kills germs, or whether there's a placebo/power-of-suggestion thing going on, because, seriously, how can it do that?!? It's not, like, numbing the way Lidocaine is...and it's not a Menthol/Camphor blend like Icy Hot and Tiger Balm...so what the heck special magical ingredient in this Neosporin can be taking away pain from a cut finger or blistered heel?!?!? And yet...it seems to actually happen! It really does!If I was still with David, I bet we'd set up some kind of spontaneous experiment, with one of us putting the Neosporin on a freshly bitten cuticle (me) and the other putting it on a patch of road rash suffered while mountain biking (him) and compare the pain relief and soothing power on different bodily regions and different amounts of nerve endings over time, because we really loved do-it-yourself science like that. Oh -- once -- after we'd both gotten really sunburned while hosting a rummage sale (I know! Sun in Seattle! We were not prepared!), we had a contest to see who could peel off the largest unbroken chunk of skin. And we were so impressed with our skin chunks that we collected them, and saved them in a jar, with the intention that we'd check on them at regular intervals, to see if they'd, like, decompose, or get dry and hardened, or...but then we forgot about the jar. And years later, after I'd moved back to Minneapolis, I found the jar in a box, and our skin was exactly as it had been, mixed together, like it was waiting for someone to rehydrate it, and....I've digressed.Regardless of the science results, I bet my boyfriend David and I would both feel that Neosporin Plus seems to really work -- it's greasier and less heavy than regular Neosporin, but if I put it on cuts and abrasions at night, they're a lot better in the morning. It has no odor, and feels kind of nice.I've added Neosporin Dual Action to my list of favorite ointments. If only I could apply it to my hurting heart.(Oh come on. You knew that's how this review was going to end. Didn't you? You did.)",Don't go cheap - get the name brand,"This is the best stuff. Once upon a time when I went through Ranger School in the Army, it was recommended that each ranger keep a tube to apply to the smallest cuts or scratches, to keep from getting infections during the training. I recall one guy who didn't and he regretted it. It's the best anti-bacterial. Don't go cheap - get the name brand and you will always know that you've prevented a situation that could easily fester and become worse.",Great stuff!,What can you say about neosporin that hasn‚Äôt already been said? This stuff is essential to have. I have a tube in all three of my first aid kits! Try not use use on small or very clean cuts as your bodies bugs will eventually build a tolerance and it will not be as effective as it needs to be.That said I use often when I have dirty cuts or scrapes or especially for topical infections.

Neosporin certainly doesnt need my review, I'm just so thankful I can even type this review at all.",I have the terrible habit of picking at the cuticles and skin around ...,"If you are going to buy an antibiotic cream/ointment, buy this one. It has all three antibiotic ingredients, in the highest concentrations available on the market. AND, ointments have a higher amount of petrolatum in them than creams, and petrolatum helps skin heal very quickly. I have the terrible habit of picking at the cuticles and skin around my fingernails, doing a lot of damage.

The foam was trimmed to make a rectangular insert that fits snugly into the part of the case that holds the body of the guitar.

Most of my printing is 70% text and 30% pictures/diagrams.Overall, this is a great product for the money. I suggest buying in bulk so you save more!",Awesome Purchase!!!,"Printworks 100% Recycled Multipurpose Paper is a PLUS!!! If you're looking for a certain type, I would definitely recommend getting this one!!!

The 3-step ladder gives you about 27 inches of reach at the top of the ladder and it's compact enough to fit in any storage area (I chose to store it next to a small gap near my refrigerator and I mainly use it for the kitchen). The maximum capacity for the ladder is about 200 pounds, but it can easily manager a few additional pounds of weight. The sturdiness of the design makes me feel well supported and reassured that whatever I'm doing at the top of the ladder that the ladder itself can easy support me which in of itself a great feeling when you're purchasing a ladder. It's surprisingly pretty heavy to hold. It's about 13 pounds and might be a chore for the wife/girlfriend moving the ladder around folding it and unfolding it.My answers to the frequently asked questions:What is the height of the top step??27.25-inches at the top.I weigh 210-lbs. Should I look elsewhere?The maximum capacity for this is 200 pounds, but it's extremely sturdy and might be able to handle your weight.Are all the steps the same size?Yes they are.I definitely recommend for any kitchen/house area that needs that extra height to reach.Like our review? Hit the ""Yes"" button below for it being useful. Leave us a comment if you have any questions or send us an email. We're here to provide our honest feedback and information on products we've tried and tested. Thanks for reading!",Everyone should own a ladder like this!!,"Had a prior step ladder just like this one that I used constantly. Finally the ladder just would not open anymore. I really like my new ladder and think the handle is even a little higher than my old one which I love. Makes me feel even safer. I would recommend this for anyone. I am getting older and will not get on a regular ladder anymore so this type of ladder comes in handy. The ladder is sturdy not cheap like others I have seen, easy to fold and store. I can easily carry the ladder around. It is comfortable to stand on. I highly recommend this ladder. Also, it has feet on it to protect your floors. Previously I had bought a safety ladder but it was bulky, heavy and difficult to use and I ended up giving it away and thus type of ladder works better for me.",One of my BEST PURCHASES!!,"Oh i luv it! Its sturdy n well-built. More than worth the money. It doesn't wobble and I feel VERY SECURE standing on it. it can hold a lot of weight. It was more than what I expected and it is perfect for me and what I needed it for. Plus several other uses. I am 5' 2"" and I used to have to tiptoe and reach high worrying that I would drop or break something, or get my son or a chair...now I get my step and can reach high, feel safe going up and down and get what I want when i want it. It folds easily and slides right between my dryer & the wall and doesn't take up space like a plain step stool would. It is sturdy, but not heavy and I am able to carry it all over my home and place things and get things off of high shelves. I used to use the heavy wooden ladder n would struggle with it all over the house, but the folding step stool is perfect. I can now clean the ceiling fans, tall windows, set valances, and high areas with floral arrangements and decorate my home with ease..not having to dread cleaning and getting out the ladder. It's PERFECT!!","If She's Happy, I'm Delirious","I bought this at the request of my sainted mother who can still change a light bulb or dust the top of her refrigerator, but she needed something safe to stand on.I let her look over the possibilities and she picked this one with that steadying handle you can see there. It really will fold up and go between the ice box and the cabinetry, and I think the weight was around 8.7 lbs. or so. Anyway, I had it delivered to her condo for her and she was amazed at how fast it got there. She reported to me that it was properly packaged, undamaged and relatively easy for an elderly dowager to get opened.I like Rubbermaid stuff on principle, she's happy, I'm happy, and there you have it in a nutshell.Buy early and buy often.","Good price, stable and versatile","Excellent quality! Took a few times to get the tab release figured out for easy, quick release. More ""stepstool"" than I want in my immediate space but finding that I use it daily and often need the extra height to reach upper areas comfortably (I'm 5'3""). It folds flat and would be perfect in my space if I had a handy ""niche"" to slide it--but that's a criticism of my space and not the step ladder. Steps are deep and sturdy. Over all very happy with this and highly recommend.",5527,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003EYVF7G

It is very solidly made and doesn't even look like a standard folding table. I use it mostly as a puzzle table, and it works very well. It is also quite easy to fold the legs - but beware...it is a heavy table, and if you are foolish enough to let the table smack you in the head while folding the legs, you will get a goose egg! :)",Nice table,"I bought this used-very good, and it arrived in like new condition. I had to search for a mark on it and found one tiny scratch that turned out to be something on the surface that I was able to rub off with my finger. It looks sturdy and folds and unfolds easily. The description said the packaging would be damaged, but the only things I noticed were the remnants of the previous shipping label that had been ripped off and the new tape where the box had previously been opened. I can't figure out why the previous person returned it. It is a very nice folding table and works well for the small space I have.",Simple and elegant. Works great as a card table!,"The first one I ordered arrived with some damage, but exchanging it was easy and quick, and the replacement was perfect!I got this to use in my card and board gaming room, and it does the job perfectly! Just as advertised, it has the portability of a folding table without having the cheap temporary look usually associated with folding furniture. It's nice looking enough to be used as permanent furniture.The legs lock in place securely while also being easy to release when the table needs to be folded up. The only downside I've noticed so far is just that the legs are not able to be locked into their folded positions, so some extra care is needed when moving the table to make sure the legs don't fall open.Overall I love this table so far!",chairs have to be ordered separately,This product is very usuable as a full time piece- the table top is very durable - was perfect for my grandson's new apartment with a tiny dining area!,"Easy to use and store, but...","The table is nice looking, and there's a lock/unlock lever on each leg. Not hard at all to set up or take down.The lever is so easy that sometimes when taking it down or carrying it, the legs will fall to the open position again. I wish the table came with a strap or something to prevent this. That is a minor thing, overall a very good buy.",233,23,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LGXZD3Z

My dining room has been taken over by Legos! Everywhere. I put pieces in miscellaneous small boxes by category but I could not take the random boxes anymore. So now we have this! We use the big drawers to put assembled Legos in and on the top we use it to put big sets on. The smaller drawers each have categories as well - we have a ""people"" drawer, accessory drawer etc. We have a lot of Star Wars Lego sets so they have their own drawer and I can still use random boxes in the drawers to separate things there too. I'm singing the praises - THIS IS AMAZING! We have very little space in our house and this fits right under the molding that is in our dining room and it is narrow enough that it slides right in behind some furniture. My 5yo can easily access it because it has wheels.The instructions to put this together were a bit busy. They were fine once I got going but I did have to prepare myself first. I had an issue getting the wheels into the bottom. They go into a little screw-looking thing that goes in the actual metal leg. That screw-looking thing would not go all the way in. It looks like it screws, but it does not! I actually took a hammer and beat it in. The wheels required a good push to get them in too. My drawers were all stuck together too but I used a hammer to pry them apart. My 5yo put the drawer pulls on - so that's an easy job for a little one. If your young child is into putting stuff together, this would be a good thing they could help with.I definitely recommend this!",Don‚Äôt have the issues many others have,"I was hesitant to purchase this unit based on the reviews about difficulty in assembling, drawers broken, inability to open-close drawers. Metal sharp enough to shave plastic from drawers etc.Disclaimer - I JUST put this thing together and haven‚Äôt loaded anything in it yet. That said:1. Assembly took me about 35-minutes start to finish.2. Allen wrench provided was adequate to assemble main frame.3. Phillips/straight head screws for drawer knobs can be hand tightened without a screwdriver. No screwdriver supplied with kit. I didn‚Äôt need one - hand tightening was adequate to secure drawer knobs.4. Main frame assembly was uneventful - just make sure of TWO things during assembly - a. There are washers that MUST go on the inside of the two outer frame pieces. They‚Äôre shown in the assembly diagram. IF YOU FORGET THEM - the sides will be too close together and the drawers will be very difficult to push in and out. I tend to think some people neglected to install the 8 washers properly (if at all). B. Do not tighten the screws as you install them initially. Install all the framing screws hand-tight first, and then, making sure the aforementioned washers are installed, tighten each screw incrementally - working your way around the unit until all the screws (Allen head wrench needed) are SNUG. If you over tighten, you run the risk of collapsing the frame tubing and that‚Äôll ruin it.5. Once everything is tight - turn the frame over and insert the caster inserts in the bottoms of the legs. These are plastic pieces that will hold the casters themselves. Press in as hard as you can - check to make sure they‚Äôre ALL the way in. Mine were out a little ways. Instead of pressing down with your body weight (risking damaging the frame), I used a hammer and just gave 3 of the more stubborn inserts a quick ‚Äòpop‚Äô and they seated easily.6. I pushed the casters into the inserts. NOTE - there are two of the four casters that lock - make sure they‚Äôre on the front or side you want to access to lock. You‚Äôll have a booger of a time getting them back out - yeah - that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm telling you this now. Lol7. Put the drawers in the slides. Mine slid in easily without force, or scraping plastic, etc. I FORGOT TO PUT THE SPACERS/WASHERS IN INITIALLY - and basically recreated what I read here about stuck drawers, hard to operate, cocked in the tracks, and cutting the plastic. I performed a ‚Äòself-induced forehead slap‚Äô procedure, then backed the frame screws out one by one and installed the spacer/washers - problem solved.8. Tighten everything up again - and then put the top on. It‚Äôs a ‚Äòforce fit‚Äô top with curved sides front and rear. I put the front of the top in position, then pulled/pushed down on the rear of the top and it popped into position for me.The unit is sturdy without anything in it. The load specification is right at 50 pounds for the cart. I‚Äôll keep things as evenly distributed in there to equalize loading and see how it goes.IF I have any issues with screws coming loose, I‚Äôll remove each in turn and put some thread lock on them.Other than that - the drawers slide in and out and are well in their tracks. It‚Äôs ‚Äòcheaply‚Äô constructed of very thin wall metal (aluminum with chrome coating). Some of the press cut edges that are the rails for the drawers to slide on are RAZOR SHARP & I can see how someone handling them during construction if not careful can cut themselves - badly. BE CAREFUL!!!In closing - I‚Äôm going to load this unit up with my wood ship modeling tools and will provide an update after a week or so to comment on durability, stability, frame flex, etc.So far - I‚Äôm okay with the unit. Not super impressed by any means, but not disappointed either. I‚Äôm more relieved that my unit came with all parts included, I didn‚Äôt cut any fingers off, and the drawers slide in and out without any effort. It meets my initial expectations. I‚Äôll update after a while.",So functional for anything!,"Have looked at this for quite some time, and finally pulled the trigger when it was a deal of the day. BEST decision ever!! I needed a central location to store all my beading materials, but still keep it organized without a thousand bins. This was perfect! It can definitely be time consuming to build... it‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs that difficult, just a little tricky. If you have an hour while watching a show, you can manage. It‚Äôs great quality and I can pull it around the house with no problem, despite it having so much in it. The only drawback I‚Äôll say, is the wheels did NOT want to go into the frame no matter what!!! Finally I used a hammer to make them go in. Now they work perfect though. Then there‚Äôs a rust/scratch mark all over a few of the bars. Idk how or why, but thankfully it‚Äôs on the back. It‚Äôs a great investment though. I even spray painted the top of it to a Seafoam to match my Office. I wish I had bought this so much sooner!",Five Stars,This is fantastic for your cricut and supplies!!!! Love mine. And so easy to put together!!!,Great Organizer for Amazon Selling Tools,"I don't write reviews often, even though I probably should being a Seller on Amazon. I should be contributing to the overall health of the Amazon Selling system. However, this particular purchase, I am especially grateful for. I am able to store all my different poly bags, UPS supplies, small supplies, Dymo labels, and even some of the larger tools such as my tape dispensers, Dymo 3lb scale, box resizer, and probably other tools I haven't found because they are scattered all over my office...

I was a little concerned when I first ordered them, and seeing how so many people stated to go a size up AFTER I ordered them.. But I went with my gut instinct and got the 7/8 (I wear a 7.5) When I received them they did fit a little ‚Äúsmall‚Äù (back of heel popping out) however after a couple of days of breaking them in, they fit perfect! They are memory foam, so you have to wear them down a little and let them conform to you. I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say to go a ‚Äúsize up‚Äù like everybody else is saying. You just gotta break them in! Very comfy though, and highly recommend!",Great slippers!,"I really love these cozy, cute slippers! I read lots of slipper reviews before choosing these, and I'm glad I picked them. They feel really soft and warm on my feet, they stay on well, and they look nice.You might want to order the next size up if you're between sizes. I'm a 9.5 or 10 and I originally ordered these in a large, but I exchanged for the XL, and the fit is perfect now. The customer service for this was also excellent - super helpful and quick.If you need slippers, I highly recommend these!",Warm and cozy - check the recommendations about size before ordering,"These slippers are cozy and yummy! I wanted something warm, easy to slip on and with a sole I could wear outside.

Very happy with my choice ... and so are my feet!",Slippers Arrived B-4 Expected Shipping Date!,LOVE these slippers! They are so soft and comfortable. I agree with those who suggest that you buy your pair one size larger than what you normally purchase. Doing that keeps your slippers very roomy inside and keeps your heels away from hanging off of the back ridge. They feel safe on my feet and are very warm. They wash well too! They were packaged well and actually arrived BEFORE my expected shipping date!UPDATE: Just purchased my second pair. My remarks all remain the same. My second pair arrived one day early just like the first pair! Be sure to buy yours one size larger than you typically wear. These do really well in the washer. I typically wash in the machine and put them over a bottle to air dry.,Super warm and comfy,"I was a little skeptical about these because I'm not a big slipper person-I prefer socks, but my new apartment floor is just too cold for socks alone. I shouldn't have worried, this are SO warm and very comfortable. I have size 9.5 feet, so these were a little bit small at first because the inner part hadn't been worn in yet-I think it will be fine as I continue to wear them. And I do wear them with socks.

It barely closed, and jams the latch shut."" I found that with an ordinary nail file I was able to trim down the clip and the cases became usable even for ""oversized"" AA batteries.","Nice packs which keep batteries handy, prevent contact/fire","I do lots of traveling and packing batteries in my photography kit.I need to keep my AA batteries organized as well as prove they cannot make contact in transit when boarding aircraft.These storage cases satisfy that requirement.I also like that the batteries are still nice and loose inside the packs, so I can open them, tip it over and drop the batteries into my hand.With some other cases I have, I have to pry the batteries out with my fingers, so this is a nice bonus that speeds my day.The closing mechanism is firm and stays closed, while remaining easy to operate and open with one hand.I like them and will continue to buy these whenever I require more cases.I like the option to connect cases together, so when I have units requiring 8 AA batteries etc, I can connect the packs and have them all handy.Very pleased!",Fits any of AA or AAA battery. Great for travel or storage,"I received a set of four of these with batteries about 4 years ago... Haven't occurred to me I could buy more cases or that they clipped together. These are last storage of multiple types of batteries and your purse with your backpack at home. Clip together to organize. Slide them apart for convenient storage in small spaces. Cases are very durable. I mark my cases so I can determine batteries needing charge and charged battery sets. Small flashlights take three batteries so being able to store five AAA batteries in a case. Means I have to carry fewer packs of batteries. I also don't have to worry about acid leaks when traveling, of course I forget to get the batteries out of my backpack or suitcase. I can quickly identify lithium versus nicad versus alkaline batteries... And battery sizes","Plastic Battery Holders, Ok","I've never owned battery holders/protectors for anything other than my 18650 batteries as I've never had the need. That changed after I traveled a few times with my DSLR Camera and portable audio recorder. I realized that the best way to not make a mess and keep my changed.uncharged ones separate is not to use sandwich bags.So I bought these. And boy are they handy. I like that you can clip them into strips and disconnect them as needed. It was helpful because I made a big strip for my large bag then disconnected a strip or two and put them into a smaller bag I ran around the convention I was attending with. When I was done and the batteries were dead I swapped them with the good ones and went about my day, always with fresh batteries on hand.Came with stickers too. I put them on, but I'm not the biggest fan. Labeling is good though, so there's that.The plastic feels pretty good and none of the hinges broke, but I can't say I've put them through heavy use. I'll be glad I have them for my next airplane flight though.",Great for the price!,"I got these to hold spare batteries for my camera flash units and other miscellaneous items. I wanted something small to tuck into a backpack pocket.These are great! They hold the batteries I need, and as a bonus, A23 batteries fit into the AAA slots and just rattle around a bit. I like the modular construction that lets me use a tiny package for just four batteries, or link multiples together when I need more. The plastic isn't the densest in the world, but it still feels sturdy. The stickers indicating charge are a clever little extra.All in all, when you factor in the price, these are excellent!

I really rely heavily on the advice of counsel when making my decisions, and sometimes that really works against me. Often times I'll find a product that has 70% or higher 5 star reviews, but even three one star write ups can make me doubt everything I've ever considered buying on this site.The same would have gone for this fountain. Except, the critical difference was that I didn't look at the reviews and I didn't buy it. Browsing on the site one day to fill up my wish list for my birthday, I decided that a fountain would be JUST the accent piece that my room needed. So when I saw the look of this one, I was instantly sold! Amidst doing other things, I didn't want to lose track of this item, so I added it to my list to look into again later. Well, long story short I forgot. And when my birthday came around and I unwrapped it, I was both happily surprised and terrified. I would feel so bad if my family and spent the $20 and it didn't work, and when I saw all the one star reviews on amazon my panic only worsened.Either way I set it up that day and turned it on, and at first it was great. But within twenty minutes the motor of the little fountain was louder than my ceiling fan! I was so disheartened thinking that I wouldn't ever use this fountain as I was breaking down the box, when lo and behold, a small slip of white paper fell out.It was a note from the manufacturer, and it stated that you needed to first THOROUGHLY CLEAN the rocks provided and to use filtered water when running the fountain. Thinking that I had nothing to lose I tried it out. So I took out the rocks and cleaned them, and I cleaned the fountain itself too, and I boiled some water on my stove. After letting the water cool and the rocks dry I put the fountain back together, put in the rocks and poured in the water.Turning it on I waited, hearing the motor sputter a bit before it went silent. I couldn't believe that it worked so well and so fast, but it has been a week now and I've been waiting for the motor to get loud again ever since! So far it's been ideal, and I just make sure to refill it when its low with purified water and I haven't had a single issue at all.I don't know if this will work for everyone, and I know that this problem wasn't what others had faced (like cracked plastic bases, dead led lights, and leaking) but it has solved one of the most complained about problems-- the unwanted nosies-- for me!Sorry about the long winded review, but I hope that if you took the time to read it that it will help you get the most out of your purchase like I am. Ever since the problem was fixed I've been in LOVE with this fountain!",Great fountain,"So I wanted to have the sound of water in my office, I also wanted a place to display some of my rocks and stones.This little fountain fit the bill and more.-Has nice sound, can be adjusted based on the rocks that I have arranged on each pedestal.-provided a place for me to grow a cutting from my bamboo plant as well, bonus!",Awesome addition to my workspace environment.,"I've tried several fountains so far. This one is awesome, the pump is quiet, as is the water, it simply provides a really nice environmental impact on my workspace. I run it up to 8 hours in a day, use distilled water only and clean it periodically, and it's running just like new after several weeks. Not all of the fountains that I've tried work quite so well, I'm impressed and happy with this purchase.6 month update. If I could give this thing 6 stars, I would. It runs so quiet, and I nearly let it go dry last weekend *(3 day weekend and forgot to turn it off...) - once I filled it up again it was just as quiet as ever. I'm beyond impressed. Still cleaning it periodically and using only distilled water.",5 stars!,I bought 2 of these fountains - one for work and one for home. They are AMAZING especially for the price!!! I spent a few weeks debating on buying this but I‚Äôm so glad I did. I have gotten so many compliments on this fountain. It looks more expensive than it was.

Here are some things that you may like to know:- It is very sturdy and does not wobble even with a 260 pound adult on it.- The height advantage it gives you is 16""- The top step is 16"" x 10""- The lower step is 14"" x 5"" and may feel a little flimsy for heavy adults compared to the top step.- The total footprint is 18"" x 18""- The steps have non-slip grooves on their surface.- It has non-slip rubber ""feet"" and does not slide on hardwood floors even with no weight on it.- It weighs a little over 5 pounds which makes it heavier than others so if, let's say, you would use this to paint a room, it may be a hustle moving it around so much. But if you are going to use it for reaching things once in a while, its weight will not be much of a problem.- Since this is not a collapsible step stool, it can be in the way and hard to store it away.I got this step stool because my grandson keeps turning a toys basket upside down so he can stand on it and reach things like light switches and the kitchen sink because he loves helping with the dishes (or playing with the water). I was worried about the basket because he almost fell once so I was looking for a step stool that has a wide top step and I decided to get this one. I just needed it to make things safer for my grandson and there are many step stools for kids in Amazon but most will not hold the weight of an adult and do not have the safer and wider top step I was looking for. Another concern is that when you buy a step stool that can only support kids, you just know that at some point in time there will be at least one adult in the house that will need to reach something and will think that the child's step stool will hold them. So, I got it for my grandson but I am sure that it will prove to be very handy for the adults in the house too.Needless to say that the little guy loved it right away and put it to work minutes after I placed it on the floor. I put felt pads under it so he can push it around until he is comfortable lifting it to move it and to get it out of the way when not being used, I just push it under the kitchen table for now.","Stable, safe horse mounting block at a very reasonable price","GREAT for mounting my horse!!! I purchased this because I needed a 2nd mounting block at our barn, but didn't want to pay the $60 plus cost of the typical heavy plastic horse mounting blocks. In fact, this is more stable than my other two-step mounting block that was specifically designed for use with horses. The four feet give it a more stable base in our sandy soil here in Florida. It is only slightly lower than my other mounting block, but that doesn't matter because it is definitely tall enough to make mounting my TWH gelding easy, and works for all the other ladies who ride at our barn. I also love it because it is much lighter weight than our other mounting block, so I can easily carry it out into the training pen, or the arena, and use it where I really need it. I did look to see if I could find it for less at Home Depot, but they have stopped carrying this stool, and didn't have anything that I thought would be as safe to use. It works great, and I saved lots of money by buying it instead of the very expensive mounting blocks available for horse enthusiasts.",The BEST most stable step stool out there!,"when you are younger you never think about falling from a foot or two off the ground. when you have someone you care about who is older and has difficulty getting to things or with balance then something like this is a must. our mom was using this old metal foot stool before. the legs kept getting lose and it was not safe. the thought of one fall and her being hurt, the medical bills. getting something like this is such a small price to pay for peace of mind.this is in my view industrial grade. it is a one piece molded stool, rock solid. due to the design it is absolutely stable. it won't slide or move when she is on it. it won't ever bend or have legs that get loose. i have no doubt it will last decades.if needing a step stool this is the best!",Great quality! It‚Äôs big!,"This is worth every penny. My daughter is 3 years old, but very short for her age. She wants to do things, like wash her hands, independently, but she couldn‚Äôt reach the sink with regular kids sized stools. This stool is HUGE and it works great for her. It‚Äôs wide and sturdy. She loves it and it‚Äôs a quality product.",Sturdy and safe,I had an earlier model that wasn't weight rated. It eventually started developing cracks that destabilized it and I had to stand on the outside edges of the top step to prevent more cracking. As you can imagine I was always somewhat fearful that as I transferred my weight from the first to the second step the stool would tip. I finally decided I needed a new one. I researched for a long time to find one that would be easily moved around the kitchen & was the right height. I finally chose this one and am so glad! This one is wider than my old one and each step is deeper. The material is heavier and the base has rubber tips to prevent sliding. There is a handle on each side making it easy to pick up and move. Overall it feels sturdier and safer. Glad I found it.,8832,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Q0I2RS

All the plugs on my side of the bedroom were taken up by my husband's xbox stuff and battery chargers. There was one more plug right behind the center of the super heavy, king-size bed that I had futilely attempted to reach in order to place an extension cord, but was unable to budge the bed for the clearance needed to do so. All I wanted was to have use of a lamp! With the flat profile and long reach of this cord, I was finally able to illuminate my pre-slumber routine without moving into the spare bedroom. I was unreasonably happy when I was able to turn on my long-neglected bedside lamp for the first time in a long time. And now he can at least move some of his stuff over to his side where it belongs. The only downside I see is that I can no longer leave my phone in another room with the excuse of having no place to charge it in the bedroom, but I'll milk that as long as I can anyway.",Whoever thought if this is genius. We use this ...,"Whoever thought if this is genius. We use this behind our bed, which is all the way against the wall and only has an outlet in the center of the headboard.

The 2nd is a spare. They arrived the day before Christmas. My son and his son visited on Christmas Day, and I put my grandson to work. He had to get on his knees and root around a bit to reach the wall socket and plug the cord in for me, then maneuver the cords to the areas I needed them in. He had to re-do the right extension to suit me, but we got my sump pump plugged in and its cord off the beaten path. That's a relief to my mind. It's too soon to grade the durability and sturdiness, but it sure seems like good value for the $.",Works great for behind a bed!,"As soon as this arrived, I plugged it in behind the bed, pushed the bed back against the wall, and plugged in our lamps. Super easy and effective. Would recommend!

So what is this little unit? Well, it's a fantastic ""movie night"" projector for a gathering of family and friends at an amazing price, but you'll need to make sure you have a very dark room (or it's very dark outside if you're having an outdoor viewing party) and you'll also need to not be a pixel snob, walking up to the screen and pointing out ""eww, I can see the pixels"". Yeah, you can see the pixels on ANYTHING if you get close enough.Okay, so the description says 1080p right? Yeah, well that means it can PLAY 1080p content from a microSD card or USB drive, it does NOT mean that the internal LCD is 1920x1080 pixels in resolution. Does that mean that it's not worth the price? Absolutely it is. I dare you to try to find a projector with an ACTUAL 1080p LCD for less than $300 (at the very low end). What it means is that you'll need to chill out and accept that your little $65 projector is not going to be as sharp as the ones at the movie theater. Did you really think it would be??I don't know about you but I always look forward to getting movies on bluray after I've seen them in the theater because even the theater ones (which costs TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars) are nowhere near as sharp as a bluray on a decent LED television, but you know what makes it cool? watching it on a HUGE screen! So if you pick this little thing up you can also grab a $20 projector screen here on Amazon and have your very own home cinema for well under a hundred bucks. This thing is easy to use, reliable, sharp (for the resolution it's capable of), and plenty bright enough in a dark room.PROS:- cheap- long life LED bulb prevents having to purchase super expensive halogen bulbs- tiny and easy to carry- has a tripod 1/4"" thread on the bottom for easy mounting- has microSD, USB, VGA, HDMI, etc...- USB will power a Chromecast, so you can just plug into USB and HDMI and have a streaming home cinema- remote works well- goes from power on to ready in well under 10 seconds flatCONS:- you won't be watching it in a bright room, the darker the better- 800x480 resolution (just don't be a pixel snob)- manual is in chinglish and very sparse (but use your brain and figure it out, it's easy)",Well Defined and Bright images,,Perfect projector!!,"UPDATEStill works perfectly and has been used probably 100 times!!

Needed something to last at least a month.A lot of floor chairs on Amazon seem to be for children, which is my guess as to why many people report breakage on other chairs after a couple weeks. I don't have time for that, for I am not a child.I'm 5'8"" and weigh 150.The Malu looked promising, so I spend the extra bucks on it. I've had it for three weeks now, and it holds up. I can rock back and forth on it without worry that it will break. The various position help for either working on my computer while sitting at my coffee table, all the way to reclining and watching a movie.It's comfortable, lightweight, and my girl fights me for it so I wish I'd gotten another haha.the only thing I would recommend to not rip the upholstery is to get off it when you're adjusting the back. if you push it all the way flat while sitting on the other end, the fabric stretches which I think would accelerate wear and tear.",Best one I've tried,"It's still early days - my husband and I have only been using our new seats for less than a week at this stage, but they are awesome! They are more comfortable than any meditation seats we have previously used and they offer superior support to out previous seats (bought elsewhere). My husband is just shy of 6'2"", so I was not sure how he would find the back support, but he has no complaints. I cannot comment on durability, because, like I said, it's only been a week, but so far, definitely impressed enough to give a 5-star rating. Love the fact that it fold fully and has a strap for easy carrying. This will be super handy for us. My one suggestion, and it's not a big deal - but having different colours would have been nice, but it's a minor point. Great job to designers.",Great Chair for Ground Sitting!,"I bought this chair because I like to sit in the floor while I do homework, but wanted something that gave me cushioning on my butt and supported my back. With this chair I may as well be sitting on the floor still. I can feel the metal running through the inside of the chair while I‚Äôm using it and the back doesn‚Äôt stay up unless it‚Äôs up against a wall. It may work for small (and I mean like 2-3 year olds) children, but anyone over the age of 5 and this chair is a complete waste of money. Even my 13 year old can‚Äôt use it...........after my review I heard from the company and Matt could not have been any nicer to me. He wanted to know what exactly my problems were and what he could do to rectify it. Currently I am waiting for a replacement chair and will update my review accordingly, but I did change my rating to 3 stars from 1 based on the customer service alone. It‚Äôs an amazing breath of fresh air to purchase from a company that actually cares about its product and the customers purchasing it. Thank you, Matt!.......update 3......after receiving my new chair I am very pleased! It‚Äôs bigger than the last one and the padding/cushioning is much better!! I no longer feel the bars running through the chair, it‚Äôs just nice and comfy to sit on. I can sit this chair wherever I want and it works perfectly.

It has a slightly deeper pouring well, and the threading feels sturdier. I cannot stand watered down iced coffee, and cold brew never seems to taste strong enough. I use a French press and the HyperChiller every morning, perfect cup of iced coffee!!!",Perfect gift for my son,"My son loves cold coffee but doesn‚Äôt like the process or taste of trying to cool it the traditional way. Instead, he would go buy a cold coffee, so when I saw this I got it for him as a gift. He called me the other day just to tell me how much he loves this chiller. He says it works perfectly to give him instantly cold coffee. All he has to do is pour his fresh brewed coffee into the chiller, and it is immediately turned into ready-to-drink cold coffee. He told me I really scored with this gift.",Easy to use and clean-makes great undiluted iced tea,"This product works exactly as described to chill whatever beverage you want without diluting it by pouring over ice. I love iced tea but one of my biggest beefs is either having to chill it by diluting it or waiting it out in the fridge for hours. I'm the only iced tea drinker in my family so making an entire pitcher doesn't make sense when I only want a glass occasionally. With the Hyperchiller V2, problem happily solved. It lives in my freezer until needed.",12542,890,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FJ6J24R

It's a genuine shame that my laptop cannot fit in it because I genuinely loved the back pack itself. The Problem is that it doesn't actually fit a 17.3 inch laptop.

It doesn't swing, it sits nicely on my shoulders; it's a must for busy graduate students or commuters who need a comfortable--but clean and modern looking--backpack.I haven't used the USB charger.

Very happy with this purchase. The only minor issue was that the backpack was slightly dirty from some packaging residue, but it rubbed off very easily.And I don't love the, or need, the USB adaptor. I guess it would come in handy if you're in the middle of nowhere and need to keep your phone charged with a battery -- but you still wouldn't need to feed it through your backpack, so it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

I wear a 7.5 shoe normally, so I purchased the 7/8 medium slippers, and they fit perfectly. I'd say they're a little bit on the looser side if I'm barefoot, but I prefer to wear socks with my slippers, so they're perfect once I put my normal socks on. One thing to note is that the sole does get flat fairly quickly. I think the sole started to wear down in about 2-3 months after my first purchase. I only bought new ones this time because my first pair was just getting too grungy looking and I like my slippers to look nice since I wear them pretty much every moment when I'm at home.

Of course, I assumed these slippers would be no different and that I would need to purchase another pair within a few months. The picture I've provided was taken after four months of frequent, every day wear and, as you can see, they still look practically new. The faux fur and padding inside the slippers is matted down and molded to my foot, but is surprisingly still quite comfortable to wear.

I'll be ordering another one in the next day or two so she can have one in the house and one in the car.I was worried the gel would make the seat to cold for her as she is extremely temperature sensitive, but she loves it. I find her happily passed out sitting up on the couch now which she hasn't been able to do for months now. I imagine she will continue to use this cushion even after she has regained some of her own ""padding"".",Beyond thrilled!,"Happy does not start to describe. Suffering with a deformed coccyx bone for year means very painful to sit for any considerable length of time. I havw tried other set cushios with cut outs that have ""fallen flat"" and I am not overly heavyset (maybe could lose 10lbs). Thaf said tried this cushion because took my grandson to Disney, I dreaded the plane ride and due to other spine issues that would prevent my walking all day I would need a scooter chair, that meant sitting mostly all day.So I looked around and decided on your ComfiLife cushion.Well, I guess this is winding up to be a testimonial, because for the first time in 15 years I could sit through the day, scooting around throughout Disney one day, Universal another Disney Hollywood the third, with my family! I did take a small break when the scooter would not fit in the small shops, and to get on perhaps 6 rides that did not twirl me too much...but I - we - my comfiLife and I did it!!!!Thank you very much!",Loved it so much... I bought a 2nd one..... GET THIS!,"I HIGHLY recommend this seat cushion. I am a receptionist and sit pretty much all day long. I've had back and neck issues from a car accident, and sitting just aggravates things more. About 6 months ago I started having shooting pains from my left hip down the side of my leg, and even worse sharp and shooting pain from just below my right butt check down the back of my leg. Sciatic issues... :( Seeing a chiropractor and starting yoga type exercise has help immensely. But this seat cushion is my real life saver. I bought one for work first and had immediate results. The right side shooting pain started to diminish. I got tired of hauling the seat from my office to the car and back again, so I bought a 2nd one. The car ride home is so much better. Just a 30 minute commute would have me limping with pain, not anymore. I'm not 100% better, I still get flareups, but less often and I know I'd be way worse all the time without this. Two of my co-workers have also purchased this seat cushion as a result of my success, and they love theirs too!",The Cadillac of Coccyx Cushions,"Save your money and don't buy those other cheap cushions. I've tried others and they do not work well, or they work for 1-2 days and you end up in pain, juggling different cushions to help relieve yourself of tailbone pain.I bought a donut... only works in my car seat while driving, and I have to adjust myself multiple times to even be comfortable. It also works in this office chair I have. I bought one of those sloping diagonal non-memory form cushions with the cutout in the back.... doesn't work in my vehicle, only works sitting on a hard flat wooden seat or on my couch - with 2 of the couch cushions under that!No THANKS! I don't want to juggle a bunch of different cushions to help my coccyx tailbone injury. And only receive partial relief too!This cushion, the cadillac of coccyx cushions, is the only one I need now. It works in my car. It works in my office chair. It works on my couch. It works on hard wood seats. I don't need the others now, and BONUS, it gives real relief and isn't finicky about how I sit on it - I sit down and it is comfortable.

They must be completely unsnapped from the table and adjusted to the desired width WHILE snapping the table onto the legs. I'm not thrilled about this and it could certainly present issues for some customers. It is one less thing to break though, so that's a good thing.Overall a good buy on a solid table. Thought others may want to know there appear to be 2-3 different styles being shipped all with minor differences as described throughout the QA section and reviews.",A Perfect Solution: Except for one Flaw Which This Tip will solve For You.,"This table is perfect, except for one flaw, which I'm going to solve for you right now.It's very unstable. If you have it stacked with some stuff and try to move it, the legs pop off pretty easily, especially on carpet. Eventually I learned to grip the legs when moving it. Now, however this tip will fix this on a permanent basis, and it still allows you to break it down if you need for travel to a show or storage, etc.Basically, I got two types of gorilla style tape. One was double stick with a blue paper you have to peel off. It's 1.5 inches in width1) Cut 4 - Four inch lengths.2) Slip the tape horizontally within the slot where you want to put the bars. If you press it in lightly with your fingers it works. Be careful as it's sticky and you don't want it to stick to itself. There should be enough to go deep into the groove with some left over to stick to the sides of the grooves.3) Put the legs in. Make sure that they are in the way that allows the grooves to be taped over. If the ""wrong"" way the legs block the tape from going across the groove. Press firmly so they are nice and tight. This adds a shim effect, plus the sticky part.4) Put a nice 4 inch strip of regular duct tape across the bar, sticking both to the tape underneath and the plastic sides.5) Those legs are going nowhere now.If you have to move it, you can undo the tape and stitch it back up when you arrived at your destination. But this makes it a carefree desk/table according to your goals.You are welcome!",It‚Äôs perfect,"I have 8 dogs which require regular grooming. I was looking for a height adjustable, stabile table to brush them while watching tv and sitting on the couch.The table is very stabile and perfect for my needs. As you can see, one of my sheltie‚Äôs thinks, that he is a mountain goat and just jumps on it whenever he feels like it. No wobbling or anything. My heaviest dog is 28lbs. I cut a piece of rubber mat to size and put it on top to avoid slipping.It‚Äôs perfect!",Absolutely perfect for my needs.,"I bought this table to be able to properly use my laptop, as well as its mouse, in my somewhat small room. After reading the measurements, I decided to take the plunge despite the lack of reviews.First off may I just say that the table arrived VERY quickly, it arrived at my door in two days flat, despite the projected arrival date (as of my writing of this review, Amazon still says it has yet to arrive and doesn't have tracking data). Upon opening the box, I expected some type of assembly, but nope! The whole thing was packaged securely and all in one piece. Set up was easy once I figured out that the legs are actually a separate piece that are snugly held in place by slots underneath the table. Despite what the description says, there are four pairs of slots underneath that allow for a variety of heights, with 28'' being the max height.Once the legs are in place, the table is very sturdy and works wonders as a mini (and cost effective!) personal coffee table.Like I mentioned before, I needed something like this to be able to work on my laptop, since my living space doesn't allow for a desk. I found that the second highest adjustment works great for casual use (such as voice chatting on Discord) while still being able to view my TV. This brings me to my only gripe, which is the fact that to properly game on my computer with a mouse and keyboard, I need to adjust the height one step up. This involves removing everything on the table, flipping it over, and then adjusting the very firm, yet sturdy legs to the desired position. All in all this is extremely minor though, considering it's a very specific need. But it goes to show that if you need to do on the fly adjustments, you should take this into account.All in all this table is absolutely perfect for me, and the quick shipping was just the cherry on top.","Great for RV. Much better than expected, I quickly ordered a second for the low price.","Much better than expected. I am using this for my Motor home for use inside in front of the sofa and outside for food, grill, etc. when camping. The design and description is different as noted by one of the other reviews which actually gives THIS table more flexibility in height adjustments and stowage since you can fully detach the legs or keep one side attached for ease in set up.

I don't have to bend over as I would either the hand held dust pans especially living in a apartment where space can be a little space tight.Durability and quality is medium meaning is not industrial heavy duty but not too flimzy that will break in a month. Another words ..you can smack a spider and keep on sweeping.The brush grooming part is useful when removing entangled long hair trapped on the brooms bristles.. but I wish they would made that little more steeper would be nicer.Storing away is convenient but the pan does not close properly.",Great Broom and Dustpan Set,I really like the way this dustpan works ... no bending required ... and the way the dustpan stands on its side with the broom clipped on for storage. The broom bristles are shorter than I expected and a little softer ... doesn't work as well on pavers as a standard corn broom would work ... but overall I am happy with this purchase.,High End Product With Amazing Pricing.,"Ordered this item and within several days (very timely granted the pandemic has slowed deliveries so I'm very pleased). Both the broom and dustpan were simple to assemble. The actual pictures don't really do this justice. It looks and feels like an upper end product and you'll appreciate that. I use the broom and dustpan daily!! My entire house is hardwood and tile flooring and it gets quite dusty here in Texas. A great product for many reasons. Quality-superior. Functionality-beyond useful. I'm really tall (6'5""), and this item is really functional and both the broom and dustpan have long handles. Excellent product, better customer service (I had an inquiry, and they responded within the half hour).",Broom combo is great for light items in the bathroom without having to touch anything!,"This product works great for light items such as bathroom hair or small papers ect. The bin lip lays tightly on the ground to allow easy pick up and disposal of things you might not want to handle, near things you might not want to have your face near! I originally was not happy with this product because the broom was soft and the bin was stiff and did not open and close or stand on its own properly. After I kept using, it did loosen and in fact does stand on its own as advertised. The seller gets 5 stars for their communication to let me know they were working with the manufacturer to improve these features without having the ""break in"" period. If your goal is light pick up without having to bend down easy storage, then this broom and bin combo would work great for you!",Handy dustpan and broom!,"Trying to find a dustpan and broom to spice up your cleaning? Well, here it is! This little package has the broom, the pan which holds it when you're done, and the bonus teeth on the dustpan to scrap off the nonsense that gathers on the bristles. You do have to screw it together when it arrives, but it's a simple process and easy to assemble, so don't fret. It's also lightweight, and sturdy so I'd say it's a win!",1403,352,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CSH21CM

I bought this for my office chair/gaming chair. I have been experiencing a lot of stress and tightness on my upper back and neck area. This thing is more than amazing. It has an adjustable height for the neck kneading and back so you can really pin point the area you want it to work on by using the remote. It vibrates and heats if you wish. It‚Äôs also has a very comfortable cushion. Everything about this product is just amazing and worth every penny.,Perfect after a long day at work,"I'm using this product as I write this, and I have to say that it works great! There's nothing like coming home after a long day at work and being able to sit down, relax, and unwind with a nice neck and back massage.I will say that when I opened it, the product had a bit of a fishy smell to it, but that has gone away pretty quickly. I also had issues figuring out how to adjust the height for the neck. I tried manually moving it, but to no avail, only to realize that you have to hold the up or down button on the remote, nothing manual other than plugging it in and putting it on the chair.The chair massages both your upper and lower back and you can specify if you only want one or both. The neck kneading is my favorite part because that's usually where I hold a lot of tension. It takes about 5 to 10 minutes for the heating to really kick in, but that's not enough of a problem for me to give it 4 stars.Overall, I would definitely recommend this product.",Powerful back massager for working at home,"Pros: Deep kneading massage, adjustable positions, heated, and looks kinda cool.I was looking for a massager that works while I'm at my desk. This brings together the seat vibration, lower-upper back rollers, and a neck massager all that can be adjusted in height to fit my 6-3"" frame. I didn't just want something that vibrated and had heat. I hoped for the kneading action but figured at this price-point; this wasn't going to happen. Thankfully I was surprised at how strong the rolling action along the lower-upper back and the neck is.I would advise using this as on an upright chair. I'm using it on my office chair. You can strap it in but I don't bother as I will set it aside when I'm done and return it when I need it again. Note that there is an auto off feature (10 minutes?) should you get up to do something and lose track of time.The neck rollers as with the back rollers are adjustable in height to dig in where you need them too. The Red lighting is just an effect that is on when you enable heat. You have a remote with quick options to choose a full - upper - or lower back routine quickly. Or you can adjust where you want the rollers on the back to focus just as you can with the neck. There is also a seat vibration with three adjustable settings but thankfully no rollers.Cons: My wife complained that this was too strong when she tried to lay on it in bed. So she uses this propped up with pillows in a sitting position.I would recommend only using this upright or with an adjustable chair that can lean back a bit so you can control how much you lay your weight on the rollers. Want a light touch? lean forward off them a bit. Want a deep tissue massage? Lay back. Be warned that these rollers can dig in.",3858,799,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PNHGL87

The first thing to recognize is that this is not professional photo printer, so if that is the use case you are purchasing for it would be best to look at other products. As a fun and convenient gadget (I don‚Äôt want to use the term ‚Äútoy‚Äù) it‚Äôs pretty great. Out of the box it‚Äôs about the size of a cell phone (a bit more thick). Set up is straight forward, simply plug it into a USB outlet and let it charge. Photos are printed via the HP Spocket downloadable app, which has an easy to use interface. After downloading the app, it will automatically connect to your printer and there you go! All ready to print! The two by three photos that print have a bit of color washout (think old Polaroid photos) but print in less than 30 seconds. The fact that the printer is portable and photo paper refills aren‚Äôt very expensive are great features. My mother (whom this was bought for) brings it with her and prints and shares photos with her friends! I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a cool photo printer to print quick snapshots on the go!",My wife‚Äôs reaction was hilarious,"So my wife asked me to get her this so she could complete her scrapbooking powers or something. I don‚Äôt know what women do. I ordered it for her not thinking much of it. When it came in today she hurled herself down the stairs like an Olympic hurdler chasing gold, which is strange because she‚Äôs been complaining all morning about how sore her legs are today from her leg day workout the other day. Then after asking for a knife to open the package she decided to forego the knife and ripped open the box like some sort of she-hulk ripping a car in half. She finally got the device out and started ripping cords out of the wall like they were weeds uglying up her perfect lawn just so she could plug her new device in. As soon as the little charging light came on things got really weird. She started giggling uncontrollably as she started syncing it to her phone and then she printed her first tiny picture and laughing hysterically. ‚ÄúLOOK IT PRINTED A TINY PICTURE,‚Äù she said laughing uncontrollably, ‚ÄúI HAVE ALL THE POWER IN THE WORLD,‚Äù she continued as she laughed like a hysterical villain in a cheesy spy movie to the point where her eyes were squinting and her abs started to hurt. I replied mockingly, ‚ÄúWHAT?! You mean to tell me that a PHOTO PRINTER‚Ä¶PRINTED‚Ä¶A PHOTO?! WHAT KIND OF SORCERY IS THIS?!‚Äù Still giggling over her new device she continued printing more pictures as I began to write out this review.This is all true, no exaggeration or embellishments at all. My wife is just weird. üòÇ apparently she loves this little device though.",So much fun!,"I did my homework before purchasing, so I knew that the print colors could sometimes be just slightly ""off"". So I stick with the recommended printer paper, keep the blue card from each new pack for cleaning and calibrating between print sessions - throwing the old one away when I open a new pack.

Generally, the most common attributes looked for are Type/Behavior, Actuation Distance, Operating Force, and the Sound Level. What is the difference between Linear and Tactile? Tactile switches have a small tactile bump that provides resistance which can be felt at the point of key actuation. The switch itself is practically inaudible, omitting the click sound present in clicky switches. Tactile switches are versatile performers that cope well with a variety of different typing tasks. Linear switches are coveted for their quiet, smooth action that‚Äôs free of any interference from tactility. Linear switches themselves are close to silent, but easy to bottom out depending on the actuation force required from the spring strength.","{'Product Dimensions': '11.5 x 4 x 1.2 inches', 'Item Weight': '1.2 pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Matrix Keyboards', 'ASIN': 'B09D4ZF9DS', 'Item model number': 'KB-ES-BLK/BLU', 'Customer Reviews': '', 'Best Sellers Rank': '', 'Date First Available': '2021-08-19'}",",,PBT Doubleshot Backlit Keycaps: The keycaps are designed with durable PBT material that is resistant to wear, friction, and solvents.

If anyone is thinking about going back to film photography I recommend this film highly.,Still good film,"I recently gave my daughter my old Pentax camera as a starter camera as she loves outdoor photography. In my opinion, there are times when 35mm is better than digital. Anyway, I used to use this film all the time and decided to get my daughter several rolls to experiment with.",Film vs Digital,Bought the film to compare my older 35mm cameras and lenses to my newer digital. The results speak for themselves. Digital on the right and film on the left. Film cost with developing about $25 and digital $0 as the card already had given me well over a thousand images. Digital wins better color quality and sharpness.,What I needed,"I still use a camera with film!! I had not been able to find the film for the last couple years, so tried on line! So glad - cause this film I've used for years & produces great photos! Thanks & I'll need more when these are used up!!",1819,205,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003HLXNJO

So much space given to C batteries, surely a couple as 9V would be more useful.However, for the slots it has, it's a great case. Up util now I've used a battery organizer that mounted to a wall, and gravity was not my friend. This case will go in a drawer, has a sturdy zipper, and the foam is pre-punched (so many reviews for other products mention having to pull the foam plugs out yourself). The zippered top to hold anything else was perfect to hold my button cells (there are button cell sloys but I buy them in strips and keep them in the strip until used), and my 9V batteries can go there if needed.So some 9V slots would make it perfect, but since it didn't advertise any and I knew that I'm not going to hold a star against it.",Perfect for my needs,"I love this case and I‚Äôm really glad I decided to get the medium (80+) instead of the small. I decided on the medium because I wanted the battery tester, but this item is not included in their smallest case. I use the battery tester all the time, and it works on both disposable and rechargeable batteries. As far as I can tell, the tester will work on most batteries, as long as each end (+/-) can touch the metal tips on the actual tester.I also have a lot of less common batteries, such as AAAA‚Äôs, lithium 123C‚Äôs, etc. I wasn‚Äôt sure if these oddities would fit anywhere, but I‚Äôm happy to report that with a little creativity (2 AAAA‚Äôs fit great in a single AA slot, the 123C‚Äôs fit snug but not too snug in a AA slot), I‚Äôve found a home for all of my batteries in this case.I also have made use of the separate zippered pouch for holding my Sony camera batteries, and any other random battery-related items. My portable battery charger (4AA slots with wall mount) even fits in the zippered section nicely, thanks to the pouch‚Äôs hard outer shell.I‚Äôve even opened the case upside-down a few times by accident, and the batteries fit well enough that all of the case‚Äôs contents didn‚Äôt become victims of gravity (nothing fell out)!Lastly, someone in another review had a great tip that I now use regularly, so I‚Äôll pass it along:I keep all of my fully charged batteries with the + side facing up and once they are spent, I flip them so the - side is facing upward. This makes it very easy to know which batteries are dead/need recharging, and which batteries are fully charged while on-the-go.I‚Äôm extremely happy with this product and highly recommend - especially for the price!",You Always Know If Batteries are There!!,"I had all my batteries in a basket so I had to scavenge to find the AAA's or AA's. Sometimes the old batteries got thrown back into the basket so it was a hassle. When I thought about getting an organizer, I didn't even know there was such a thing available. Voila! Amazon always has what I need! This made life easier when I needed to change batteries in an item. All in the container are in working order, neatly arranged by type in spongy holders, a zipped net holder for tiny batteries or odd sizes and when you close it, it zips shut and it is put back into the drawer without a basket of junk! YEA! I bought this one because I don't need to keep a 100 batteries at a time and it fits into my drawer. I am a happy purchaser and very proud I can retrieve a battery that I know works. The battery charges has it's own slot. Always there and easy to find!",Holds a lot,"We'd been keeping batteries in a plastic storage container with a handle on the lid and clips to hold the lid to the container. It had been dropped a number of times when the lid was not on right and was cracked and held together with packing tape. I was going to buy a battery holder from QVC but it sold out before I ordered. So I went looking. I like this better since it has a much smaller footprint and a better price. Also, since it is not hard plastic, if it gets dropped it won't crack. It holds plenty of batteries. The only negative is that there are no dedicated slots for 9-volt batteries, but the mesh pocket in the top can hold them along with button cells. The battery tester is a real bonus--threw out our old one that had a wire ready to break completely.",Absolutely perfect size!,"Many of these battery cases are gigantic - I don‚Äôt need to hold 50 AA batteries. I wanted a case that held a solid amount, but not too many. The mesh zipper section is very nice for multiple button cell batteries in the cardboard strip or for 9V. It‚Äôs a bit odd that there weren‚Äôt a few dedicated slots for those, but the mesh section will hold it nicely. The battery tester worked well and detected some dead batteries I found when cleaning through a drawer.It‚Äôs priced right, has a nice case and would be a great gift for nearly everyone, especially a new homeowner or that hard to buy for person.

I can hop right up on top and the table doesn't even wobble when I pounce. There is a nice padded top that is Purrrfect for sharpening my kitty cat nails with. My only complaint is there is a good amount of space and my human keeps putting her craft supplies on my table. Luckily it's big enough I can stretch out and knock things off if they get in my way. My human can easily fold this right up and slide it away for easy storage. Lucky for me she keeps forgetting, giving me ample time to destroy the lovely top with my claws. We both highly recommend for the price. Your cat will love it just as much as you !",Perfect for any use you need it for,"I bought this as a family game table in the house. It is not only perfect for card and dice games, it is the perfect table to set up my easel and paint at. The height is a great height, and works for the really tall and kids. We have also started using it occasionally as a dinner or lunch table. It folds up very thin, but still has a hefty weight. A great, sturdy table. Dinner- dungeons and dragons-oil painting canvas. Good for everythingEdit: I love it so much, that I actually bought a second one.

They are sturdy, I've had grown adults between 18 and 35 sit on the chairs and they hold really well. Folding the chairs back up is difficult because of the safety lock but I actually really like that feature - means my kid isn't going to have the seat collapse on her. Good trick to closing it = lay it on the side with the latch close to the ground and push down on it and slightly push the chair in. It's less of a strain/pain on your finger/hand and it is much easier/quicker.",Sturdy table,"This card table is perfect for me.

Your rear end will thank you.,"On a long and uncomfortable flight to Hawaii I managed to mess my back and tail bone really bad. I even paid to have a professional massage done because seating was impossibly painful and I work either driving around all day or in my home office. Nothing seemed to help. I considered getting one of those doughnuts cushions for people with ‚Äúhemorrhoid problems‚Äù but was too embarrassed to go to Walgreens looking for one.

Wanted handles but not bulk. Also was looking for something with 2 smaller pockets rather than 1 big one. This case fulfilled everything I was looking for. The handles are not the strudiest but do not plan to be carrying it by the handles for extended periods. It's slim enough to put in a large purse. And the teal is a very attractive color and design. The pockets are large enough to fit the charger, pen, USB hub, and more. To address some. Concerns from other reviewers: I did not notice any smell at all. Also, the handles are sewn outside of the case, so it does zip fully. I got the 11.6"" to 12"" style, and it is a tight but perfect fit for the surface pro and helps keep its very slim and lightweight profile. Am very satisfied with this product.",Bought a few of these and they Work Perfect for my Kids Asus 11.6 Notebooks,"Got these for my kids Homeschooling during the school going remote for covid.Bought the Purple one, pink one, and the blue ones.

I assumed would have happened the first week...lolThese really are holding up great, zippers all work perfect and nothing is coming frayed or anything.Really recommend these for keeping your kids laptops protected.",Great sturdy case,I bought this for my daughters school issued touch screen laptop. It's a very pretty color and sturdy material. Love the pockets on the front and the handles are great. It's a light color so it's gotten dirty quickly but I have been able to spot clean some of the stains pretty easily with Dawn. The only slight downside is that it's super tight but I think that is mostly to do with the heavy/thick computers that the school system chose.,Love it!,"A review from Amanda (the wife who bought this): I love this! Great laptop sleeve. I love the vibrant colors and the decoration is nicely printed.A few notes:1. Yes, it is a glorified sleeve. This is not a super strong laptop case. But I knew that when I bought it. I didn't want something bulky, but something mainly to slip it into when not in use to keep it up from the kids and dogs.2. Yes, it has a strong smell, but that's the processed materials. It does dissipate, but if it's a gift and you're worried, I'd say order at least a week in advance and let it air out.3. It's very loose on my laptop. Not a problem, but most reviews were commenting on the tightness of the sleeve. I have a Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 15"" laptop. I'd say the thickness is between a MacBook Pro and a MacBook Air for the Apple fans. I have my laptop at a three subject notebook in the main pocket and there is still a little wiggle room. In fact, I'm thinking of getting a plan sleeve or sewing up a sleeve with a pocket to slip into the case. Not a game changer for me, though. I like being able to carry a notebook in the main part.4. The pocket on the front is nice. I currently have a Samsung Tablet, a Huion drawing tablet (with cord and stylus), a 6' hdmi to micro usb cord, and my laptop cord. It's bumpy, but not that bad. I've even still got room in case I need to slip some other cords or pens inside.5. The strap is pretty nice and is comfy. The clips and rings look a little flimsy, so I'm going to watch that. I wouldn't bang it on the door frame or anything. If they break, I'll just end up sewing on some better ones, but if you can't sew (or just don't want to), watch the strap.Overall, I love it and I'd buy one of these again. And no, I did not receive this product to review it. I just really like it. :)",Great fabric sleeve that offers a good amount of protection,"Bought this for an 8 inch Samsung tablet in a smart case - it fits but is a tight fit. The exterior fabic has a nice cloth feel to it. The interior is super soft material. And by feeling, it seems there is a neoprene sort of interior layer for added protection. This is a soft sided case - meaning it won't protect your device from being bent. There is an exterior pocket that is great for perhaps headphones and a cleaning cloth. The pocket isn't designed to bulge out - so whatever you put it there can't be very thick. And once the tablet is in this case, it's not that easy to get your hand into the pocket - the solution to this is... Access the pocket while the device is not in the sleeve and no problems.This is a stylish and practical sleeve that is classier than the neoprene cases/sleeves that cost the same or more. The zippers are solidly attached and have strong looking zipper pulls. Overall it appears to offer good protection at a very reasonable price.I bought this item. No discount for my comments.

The only thing that stymied me was when the diagram told me to remove a piece of foam and tape inside the printer. Spent 10 minutes trying to find something that was not there. The printer is the quietest printer I have ever heard. You do not place the ink cartridges into the printer until you have charged up the battery, which took about an hour. There are only 2 ink cartridges for this printer. The exterior of one has a pink top and the other has a black top. You place each one next to its corresponding color inside the printer and pull the plastic piece whose color matches the cartridge over top of the cartridge until it snaps onto the two horizontal tabs on the top of the cartridge. You must com0lete either the online setup or the setup with the included disk for the scanner to work. I set up online since my laptop has no CD or DVD slot. The online setup worked well. You just sit back and let it do its thing. I only plan on using this printer when I travel so it will not get constant use. I like its compact size. It is so small it even qualifies for Sprint Airlines ""personal item"" to carry onboard without charge. UPDATE: I have taken this on 2 trips and TSA never asked to see it or have it turned on when I put it through screening at the airports. The printer works very well. I know I use it more on trips more than it is designed for, about 300 pages printed a week and the same number of pages scanned, (the manual says it is designed for 300 printed pages a month) but it has never jammed or even hiccupped. It is still new but with the heavy usage I think if there was a problem it would have surfaced by now.",LOVE IT! Very portable and high quality!,"First off, I LOVE THIS PRINTER. It came packaged very nicely and the installation took me less than 5 minutes. Inserting the ink cartridges was a bit tricky, but there were help videos you could watch on the little printer screen that help tremendously. This printer is small enough that it can fit in my backpack, which is absolutely amazing. Also, despite its size, printer quality is not sacrificed a single ounce-- the photos I have printed look just as good as photos that I have printed using a bigger, more expensive printer.I have had this printer for about three weeks now and have had zero problems, printer malfunctions, or complaints. It is a great little printer and well worth the money.Just a heads up: if you want to print a multi-page, double-sided document, it will print on one side of all the papers and then ask you to re-insert the paper in order to print the other side. It's a bit confusing the first time or two, but it's a non-issue once you get the hang of it.",Great little printer,"Great little printer! I was surprised, usually these little mobile printers are slow and do not work well. I travel full time in a vintage Greyhound bus and room is of the essence.

I am very pleased with how it works and the print quality. I don't have any particular need for fast printing or large quantities, so it suits my needs just fine.

I love that it has a battery so if I need to use it anywhere I don't have to carry the cord around. The battery standby life is fantastic. I couldn't say about it's life under heavy use.For the price, if you plan to just leave it in one place, choose a different model.

Probably saved my life. Epson for the win.,"Finally, a printer that I don't want to fling out of the window! (or beat it with a bat)This printer has just taken 6 years of past stress out of my life. (HP you horrible piece of trash.)I am a teacher that obsessively prints color copies for her class. Obsessively. Color prints are nice.The one problem that I ran into was the excessive cost of color ink.It was so expensive for me to print, that I started injecting purchased ink from 3rd parties into old cartridges to save money. (Teachers don't have deep pockets folks. I'm printing with my own personal money.)Injecting ink took forever and was messy and got all over my hands, but I thought it was worth it, b/c I was printing color copies for pennies.Then HP updated their firmware (I was stupid to update) and BOOM. It would NOT allow me to continue inserting refilled catridges. ""ERROR! Error!"" And since those little tiny cartridges only held between 15-25 ml of ink, I was literally crying while refilling every other day and crossing fingers to see ""if it would /work/ this time"" or break again which would send me back to wal-mart to buy an overly expensive crappy cartridge that would run out of ink in 3 days.Want to know what error it said? ""This printer does not support continuous ink systems.""and HAH. Until that point, I didn't know that ""continuous ink printers"" EXISTED.So thanks HP, for showing me EPSON's (probably) life saving Eco-tank printers.I mean thank GOD for EPSON.Finally, I can afford to refill the tanks with name brand ink, without feeling like I'm getting majorly ripped off.I'm all for supporting a company, when their products are priced well within my means and aren't exorbitantly overpriced. (I mean, they are still making a profit. But not one that will break my bank!)Why can't my students have nice things?I'm so happy I want to cry.Primary use: 500 color and black and white copies weekly.Daily copies of:> Classroom color worksheets> Colored Brag tags that I laminateThings I don't care about:I'm not printing photo-quality wedding album photos. Not that it wouldn't, but that's just not something I care about.Touch screens. This one is fine. You touch buttons. The printer works. Do you really need more?Cords. I'm wireless. I don't need a complementary cord.Things I do care about:> printing in color> printing duplex> not having to refill the paper tray every 3 minutes. 250 pages is the best!> not having to WORRY CONSTANTLY ABOUT STINKING INK LEVELS and ink PRICESI cannot wait to see how well this printer works over the long term. *crosses fingers*",Great for sublimation crafting,Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She was getting into sublimation heat pressing. This printer does an excellent job for the money. Make sure you don't use the included ink if you are going to use this for sublimation printing. You have to buy special sublimation ink.,"WORTH WAITING FOR, BUT BE CAREFUL","I'm glad I waited for this third-generation Ecotank printer. Setup was ridiculously fast and easy, the features are great, and the print quality is more than adequate for my needs. My wife and I especially like the automatic duplex printing and the ability to print from virtually anywhere in the world using Epson Connect.Yes, it's a tad noisy and it doesn't have a document feeder, but if those things were dealbreakers I would have purchased a more expensive model.This printer is replacing a $92 wireless printer that sucked up $80 worth of ink every 5-6 weeks. Yes, it's more expensive upfront, but if you consider that this will use $60 worth of ink every two years, it's well worth the cost.EDIT: The price of this item dropped by $50 immediately after it was ordered, but Amazon refused my request to adjust the price. Beware.",You won't regret buying this printer.,"My husband bought this printer for work. He works from home, so I've been able to use it frequently as well and so far I'm loving it. I will say that setting it up was a nightmare. I'm far from technical guru, but do have moderate experience with computers and have set up several printers over the years. The main issue was getting the software on his work computer that does not have a CD drive. You can download the software from the Epson website, but for some reason it was extremely difficult to do. After downloading I would get an error message saying it was unsuccessful. After fighting with it for 3 days I finally got it setup, and I honestly have no idea how I did it so I cannot give any tips for others in a similar situation. After the initial headache though, it's been smooth sailing. I love the borderless printing option, it really does print all the way to the edge of the paper with excellent quality. The ink is super easy to load, and will save us a bundle of money over the life of the printer. You get a LOT of ink! The scanner on our last printer was awful. The picture quality was pathetic. This scanner is crazy good! We were both impressed with how well and clear the scanned images are. Same with the copier. I have no complaints whatsoever about this product and would absolutely recommend it without hesitation, although it'll be a lot easier to install if you have a CD drive to install the software. Once you have it set up, everything is very easy to use. The printer basically walks you through everything. If you can read, you can use this printer. The only thing my husband doesn't like is that you can only scan one page at a time and you have to place each page individually on the scanner/copier. He has to scan dozens of pages at a time, and he is used to putting a stack of pages in the printer all at once (the way you put blank paper in for printing). That's our fault though for not completely reading the product description before purchasing, so I certainly can't take away any stars for our own error. Overall, you really can't go wrong with this printer. I've been at my parents house over 100 miles away and can print things as if I were at home where the printer is. My only regret is not buying it 3 years ago.",Save money printing!  This little printer is AWESOME!!!,"I‚Äôve been a fan of Epson printers for many years, based on my ownership of an Epson Workforce 633 for over 8 years. I purchased refillable catridges and a chip resetter that kept my printing costs WAY down. I printed a BUNCH of stuff on that printer. The printer outlasted 3 kids through High School and College and printed forms for our photography business (Wedding contracts, order forms, etc.) and even custom DVD labels that looked VERY professional.So, when my Workforce 633 finally refused to print, I looked for another Epson as a replacement. Luckily, Epson now has a line of printers that you can refill with ink without purchasing 3rd party components. Welcome the Epson Ecotank series of printers!I looked at the Epson EcoTank ET-2720 and ET-2760 as possible options (I‚Äôm thrifty and my printing needs are NOT that elaborate). The latter was about $30 more, and I opted for that model. The main reason I selected the ET-2760 is that automatic double sided printing is supported.The printer arrived quickly, as most Amazon Prime shipments do. Unpacking involved removing a lot of tape that secures the printer in the box for shipment. Unboxing and setup are super quick and easy. The longest part of getting ready is filling the EcoTank with the supplied ink.The total time from start to printing out my first document from my computer was about 30 minutes. I was taking pictures during the unboxing and installation with my phone, so probably a bit slower than other reviewers. I followed the steps outlined in the ‚ÄúStart here‚Äù guide and you should too. Especially where it mentions ‚Äúdo not drink the ink‚Äù. Seriously, it‚Äôs there under setp 2‚Äôs warning section. So, I heeded their warning, although I was tempted to take a sip (No, not really). Notice that you don‚Äôt connect the printer or turn it on until after the ink tanks have been filled and the printer drivers and utilities are installed on your computer.A few more notes on setting up your printer if you utilize the wireless option. If your router has dual band capabilities ‚Äì i.e it broadcasts in 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz - make sure you select the 2.4 GHz connection. And, if you‚Äôre running software that monitors and allows/disallows connections through your firewall (HIGHLY recommended), don‚Äôt forget to allow access for the setup to complete successfully.So, how does the printer perform? Very well if your expectations are in line.Setting up voice activated printing was easy, but a little tedious. Like most other devices that connect to Alexa ‚Äì like our Wyze Cams and our Whirlpool microwave/oven combo ‚Äì you have to enable the proper Alexa skill and perform a few more steps before use. Then, you have to setup your printer to an ‚ÄúEpson Connect‚Äù account. You‚Äôve hopefully already completed this step when you setup your printer drivers and utilities.As mentioned above, this printer supports voice activated printing. What actually does that mean? Well, as HUGE fans of the Amazon Alexa devices, it does provide some interesting ‚Äúneat‚Äù features, although I‚Äôm not sure how often we‚Äôll actually use them. We have, at last count, 6 Alexa devices in the house, ranging from Echo Dots to the Echo Show (2nd gen). So, you can do things like ‚ÄúAlexa, ask Epson Printer to print my shopping list‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúAlexa, Ask Epson Printer to print my calendar‚Äù. Of course, don‚Äôt forget to include ‚ÄúAsk Epson printer‚Äù, or you‚Äôll confuse Alexa. But, this isn‚Äôt really necessary for me, as I use the Alexa shopping list and to do list on my phone and don‚Äôt need a printed copy in hand. The same goes for my my Google calendar or to do list. But, if we were printing a calendar for the family fridge, that might be a cool feature!The only negative thing I can point to about this printer is the paper capacity (But, after reading the reviews, I already KNEW that). It says 100 sheets, but that‚Äôs a stretch. I‚Äôve found that anything more than say 35 pieces of white copy paper will not work without an issue. You‚Äôve been warned.So, am I happy with the printer? After a few weeks of use, I can say that things are really going well. We‚Äôve printed about 250-300 pages thus far. This includes several wedding contracts awaiting signatures, bridal fair wedding package handouts on high quality resume paper and professional looking DVD labels for the DVDs we‚Äôre handing out at the bridal fair later this month. All of the print looks AWESOME and the colors are true to what‚Äôs on my monitor. If anything changes, I‚Äôll update the review and adjust the star rating if necessary.",9145,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q1NYMDR

It's still quiet and going strong!My old Targus mat which has served me well has over time become extremely noisy. In researching pads as a replacement, I automatically discarded the higher priced ones with adjustable speeds, glowing LEDs, trendy designs, and whatnots considering my laptop would be covering all that expensive eye candy. My priorities were rather basic: (1) thin & lightweight, (2) cooling performance, and (3) quiet. The HV-F2056 fits the bill and works as advertised:Thin & lightweight: The design fits 15.6‚Äù ‚Äì 17‚Äù which works for me. I have a MSI GS70 2QE Stealth Pro with a screen size of 17.3‚Äù and overall length of 16‚Äù and width of 11.25‚Äù. With both units side by side (with the exception of length), the Havit is almost the same width and thickness as my laptop. The aluminum wire mesh design makes it definitely lighter and seems sturdy enough for traveling, so no problem there.Cooling performance: There are 3 monster 110 mm fans spinning at 1000 RPM which is almost double my old Targus and I can definitely feel the results of the updraft as the laptop bottom and sides are cool to the touch. I ran CoreTemp and HWMonitor with the fan off/fan on to be sure and there is definitely a drop in the internal temperature. The fans are also at the perfect location for my vents. What I did not want is a pad where the housing part had a lot of plastic that would cover the vents and with this being an all mesh surface it wasn't an issue. The 3rd pic shows the glow of it running. Like I said earlier, your laptop covers most of the unit so the lights aren't obtrusive.Quiet: Unless I‚Äôve gone noise blind, I can‚Äôt hear this pad running! I think this cooling pad strikes a good balance between the amount of airflow and noise. I've also discovered that those fancy LEDs lights are not just another pretty glow, they may actually serve a purpose like‚Ä¶ reminding you to turn off the cooling fans when you‚Äôve shut down everything else!Power/Charging: This is not really a gripe since I‚Äôm a chord/adapter hoarder, but (a) a 12‚Äù USB chord come with the fan which is actually a tease and way too short, and (b) it does not come with a wall power source. I hate using my laptop as a host for power when not on the road, so was surprised there was no option to run from a wall source. Let‚Äôs face it, the reason many of us buy a cooling fan is to extend our battery life. While the cooling pad has a rating of 5 volts which seems minimal, it still converts to watts which adds to more battery drain to cool. Anyway, nothing a usb male-female extension cable and adapter couldn‚Äôt fix.Overall, this is a great cooling pad that is quiet, well built, sturdy, doesn‚Äôt slide around, and cools air effectively. As for durability, it‚Äôs a little too soon to tell. As for price, it‚Äôs a great value for the quality & thinness.","Worked Very Well on 2018 MacBook Pro 13""","Very surprised at the effectiveness of this.Using this on a 2018 13"" i7 MacBook Pro. Had some overheating shutdown issues with this machine (a bit frustrated with Apple: Too much design over function lately) so picked this one due to the positive reviews.Here are the results:Test 1: Laptop at idle:Pre cooling pad Processor Temperatures: ~50 degreesPost cooling pad processor temperatures: ~42 degreesTest 2: Compressing a 2min video to MP4 using handbrake in with standard MP4 setting:Pre cooling pad: Internal fans would kick in after about 10 seconds and run at about 3000 rpm. Video would take 31 seconds to renderPost cooling pad: Internal fans came on after about 20 seconds and ran at about 2700 rpm. Video took 28 seconds to renderTest 3: General Web Browsing:Pre Cooling Pad: Processors sat around 55 degreesPost Cooling Pad: Processors sat around 45 degreesSo, there you go. Some very unofficial and basic tests to show how it helps on an '18 13"" MPB. Hope this helps.",Extremely helpful for long gaming sessions!,"I use this cooling pad every day with my MSI GS65 gaming laptop. It's powered over USB and has 3 giant fans which keep the laptop as cool as possible while gaming. The blue LED lights are a nice touch that let you know that the mat is on and gives it an overall nice aesthetic.There are 2 USB passthroughs on the back located near the power switch which is nice because it does take up one of the USBs on your laptop. (One of the USBs is used to connect the pad to the laptop, leaving 1 for an additional device.) Pretty sure the USBs are USB 2.0.There are kickstand legs that come out to raise it at various angles depending on your working surface. They're very strong and not flimsy at all.It doesn't have the nicest build quality in the world as it is made of plastic and is pretty lightweight. However it keeps it lightweight and since it's not metal, it won't get extremely hot either.If I had one complaint, it'd be that if you hold the cooling pad firm enough while it is on, the fans will rub up against the chassis causing a loud grinding noise. If you're careful with how you hold it and don't clamp down on it, you won't run into this issue very often. This doesn't affect the performance of the cooling pad at all, but if it was built a little stronger, this most likely wouldn't be an issue.The fans are decently quiet (a lot quieter than my laptop). I can hear sound coming from my computer speakers with no issue, although if you're going to game, I'd still recommend headphones anyways.Overall I'd recommend this cooling pad to anyone looking for a budget-friendly option. It's not the best out there, but it does its job and I can't complain.",Quiet and drops temperature significantly!!,"I bought this product along with its number 1 competitor, the Tree New Bee, because I have a computer that has a fan that seems like it runs on high when the computer is over 50 degrees celcius. Overall, I am very impressed with both!! The Havit and the Tree New Bee both dropped the temperature of the laptop by 10 degree Celsius during idle temp and dropped 4 degree Celsius during a 10 minute benchmark test. The only thing that made this one better was that it is whisper quiet (I could not hear it running at all). After testing, I prefer the havit because it is quieter and it drops the temperature of my laptop by 10 degrees so the fan doesn't go into the high-speed mode unless I am doing something to require high CPU or GPU utilization.Picture 1 - without cooler on a flat deskPicture 2 - Havit - model F2056Picture 3 - Tree New Bee - model K0025Tests performed on a 15.6"" laptop with a 4700MQ processor",29742,7,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NNMB3KS

The pump finally went bad in it and I decided to upgrade to Ooler. Lots of differences and overall it's a huge upgrade.- Ooler has three fan speed settings (silent, normal, boost). It will cool/heat faster with the higher fan speed settings. It's also possible that it may not be able to reach the lower/higher temperatures you desire using the lower fan speeds, but I haven't had an issue with that. I typically run mine in normal speed and it's noticably more quiet than the old Chilipad Cube. I would say the Chilipad (which only has one fan speed) is about as loud as the Ooler on ""boost"" (the highest fan speed).- Ooler has a much larger water reservoir. The water reservoirs are not sealed in either the Ooler or Chilipad. I was typically adding water to the Chilipad about every 3 days, which was a pain. I've gone two weeks and haven't had to add water to Ooler yet.- No noticable bacterial growth in Ooler water tank. Apparently due to the integrated UV light. Chilipad you had to add hydrogen peroxide every so often and even then I would see some junk collecting in the Chilipad water tank from time to time.- Ooler does not seem to get quite a cold as the Chilipad. The Chilipad would freeze me out if I set it on the lowest setting. I don't find the Ooler does that. The hose connecting the Ooler unit to the mattress pad is significantly longer than the Chilipad (probably 4x as long at least). It is nice you have flexibility on where to place the unit, but I'm wondering how much heating/cooling is lost in that extended length of tube. I don't run Ooler at the coldest settings so it hasn't been an issue for me.- The Ooler app needs some work. It's been working better lately, but sometimes it just doesn't want to connect to the unit (it connects via Bluetooth). There is no remote (like Chilipad), you must use your phone (or set a schedule). You can also adjust the temperature on the Ooler control unit itself. When the app doesn't want to connect, it's a pain since a few settings are only controllable through the app (fan speed and schedules). The app is missing a few features. For example, you can set schedules to have it automatically turn on/off at certain times, also you can adjust the temperature along the way (say turn on at 10pm to 60 deg, then change to 70 deg at midnight, and then to 100 degs at 6am). You can't adjust the fan speed (silent, normal, boost) on the schedule, which would be nice.- Since Ooler connects via Bluetooth and not Wifi, there is no ""cloud control"" compatbility. It doesn't integrate with Alexa/Google Home, etc. You phone needs to be in bluetooth proximity to the Ooler unit to control it. That said, it has a lot more range than I would have expected. I am able to control Ooler from downstairs with the unit upstairs.- If you're new to Ooler/Chilipad, you pad needs to be covered by a blanket (insulation) to get cold or hot. Also you need to have it turned on and cooling/heating before you get into bed. I usually turn mine on one hour before I get into bed. Expect it will feel cold when you get in, but that feeling dissipates quickly, but fear not it is still working. It's made a big difference in mine and my significant other's sleep quality. A lot less tossing and turning and waking up in the middle of the night. This is confirmed by my Fitbit sleep tracker.Overall it's pricey, but worth it.",Ooler Is Worth Every Penny! The Bad Reviews Don‚Äôt Reflect the Current Product,"I bought the Chilipad sleep system on the recommendation of my two sons. Both have the Chilipad and use it nightly. While I saw terrible reviews associated with the Ooler upgrade, I took a leap since it appeared that it would provide an added benefit. I have now been using the device for only two weeks but it has renovated my sleeping life completely. The app which received bad reviews, works perfectly in my case. I have four schedules depending on what time I hit the sack. I can only assume that the app has been fixed after so many complaints since it does exactly what it is expected to do. There were two firmware updates upon installation that were simple, the device is not noisy and its size fits conveniently under my night table. So, I will be back to update this review if it breaks or stops functioning as some had complained but for now, it is a great invention. I only wish there was a convenient travel size since I will miss it when on the run. For the first time in years, I look forward to bedtime.",Game Changer,"Love. This. Ooler! I bought something similar (a little less expensive and MUCH lower quality) so when I received my Ooler, things for me seriously changed.Last cooling pad had no covering (just flat plastic pad), no water sanitizer plan (actually, it did... remove pad from bed and drain it and along with machine every few days), no auto controls (small remote you can‚Äôt see or operate in the dark), limited info included (two page insert, no ‚Äúhow to‚Äù directions on generic website and no app at all), and no temperature settings (actually, there were three - Cold, Colder and Freezing).The Ooler is a total game changer for me. I may have a different view because I had a sub-par solution previously. But I‚Äôve found the features on this sleep system amazing. I use it for cooling my serious ‚Äòmiddle of the night wake up soaked‚Äô hot flashes as well as a full body heating pad when my chronic pain/Fibromyalgia kicks in.Some reviews commented on the app but honestly, I‚Äôve had no issues at all (but before, I‚Äôd turn on the light at 2am to change temp because tiny remote is MIA). Needless to say, I love it. It even goes on vacation with me! Really not sure who appreciates my sleep system more... my husband or me!!",Life Changing,"I'm a hot sleeper. Always have been, and I always will be. Due to events in my personal life I have been working through issues with anxiety. And with everything going on in the world and working in the medical industry my anxiety has only been even more of a hassle to handle. One of the main areas of my life that my anxiety has affected more than anything is my ability to get restful sleep. I do everything from therapy to weighted blankets and even melatonin. All have helped to a degree but all it takes is an anxious night and waking up hot and sweaty and it feels like you're back at square one. After doing a bunch of research I learned about the Ooler sleep system and watched a few review videos and a testimony from the inventors so I decided to give it a shot. Now I can absolutely say this product has changed my life for the better. I've tracked my sleep quality for years and I have seen drastic improvements in my quality of sleep and my ability to stay asleep through the night. Even if my mind is racing or if my body feels like it wants to be hot this pad comes right in and cools and soothes me to sleep. It has made such an impact on my life that I barely ever take melatonin now and I have referred it to so many of my friends. A few of them (single and married) are already planning on getting the system themselves. The pad itself is super soft and I only even feel the tubes if I dig like my elbow or my heel into the bed. The placement of the hose can also cause you to feel it with your hands or your feet depending on how you orient the pad on your bed but the benefits BY FAR out weigh the cons in my opinion. Overall it doesn't change the comfort of my mattress. The alarm clock and Warm Awake feature on the app is also a must if you're like me and keep your bed set to Arctic Tundra at night so you'll actually get out of it in the morning. This pad has absolutely changed my life for the better and I don't know if I could ever go back.",A Life Changing Product,"Seldom do I do product reviews and never did I consider a product life-changing -- until now. I am a 'hot sleeper'. Not sweating, just HOT. No matter where I am or what the room temperature is, I produce a lot of body heat while sleeping (my wife appreciates it on a very cold night). In the past 5 years, we have tried 3 different mattresses looking for one that would help me sleep cooler. Result: two of our friends have 'inherited' very nice, barely used mattresses. I used to sleep with a large 'body pillow' (actually two of them, which I would switch out during the night). Nothing worked to turn off the furnace. Until the Ooler sleep system. I had read about chill pad type products in the past but was always highly skeptical. Running cool water through tubing under my body sounded way too good to be true, and I suspected that it was just a gimmick. Boy, was I wrong. I put the Ooler on my side of the bed (my wife gets cold at night rather than warm, although the Ooler can also be used to warm the bed), filled it with water as instructed, downloaded the app for my phone, set the temperature for 60 degrees and went to bed, filled with doubts. I got the best night's sleep I had in YEARS! No exaggeration. What's more, I never really felt cold in the night; it is not like sleeping on a block of ice (which was one of my concerns). The Ooler just seems to drain away the body heat that I still no doubt produce. I sleep hours longer than I used to sleep, and the body pillow that I used to absorb excess body heat barely gets warm. Instead of waking up groggy and needing my caffeine to get started, I wake up refreshed and with a great deal of energy. The Ooler is worth absolutely every penny of its not inconsiderable cost, and it's a lot cheaper than buying new mattresses. Try it. I think they offer a guarantee that you can send it back if not satisfied. But you will not send it back. I would not part with my Ooler sleep system for anything.",384,78,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RX8LT9G

CON: that somewhat hardened sole is a bit loud on hardwood floors, so when I'm up before everyone else in the house (which is pretty much every day), I end up carrying them around the house and only putting them on once I'm in my office with the door closed, or sitting in my recliner in the TV room.

At about $7 per bottle though, it was costing me more to buy it that way rather than brewing my own hot coffee and adding ice. It wasn't until I was perusing YouTube and saw one of my favorite YT'ers pouring her own cold-brew out of a refrigerated container. I immediately toggled to Amazon in a search for one similar and I found this product. After comparing prices and reviews, I decided to give this one a try. 3 weeks and several brews later here are my takeaways:Pros: Easy to clean and use, coffee tastes great, not going back to buying pre-made!Cons: Durability seems fragile as the soft foamy plastic on the handle is coming up already, it will leak if you don't screw the lid on tight so beware, since it has to brew laying down it takes up more space in my small fridge than I'd likeOverall though, it's a much cheaper alternative to pre made cold brews and you can control the strength and taste of your coffee by selecting the brand/grounds/roast you want and by adding more or less ground to the filter.Special Note: I read through a lot of reviews and it seems the main issue most people had was the coffee grounds seeping into the liquid. It appears from reading the replies from the manufacturer and by my own experience with this, that they have created a smaller mesh filter and have stopped shipping the product with the old style. The new style is so good that I'm using fine ground coffee and have had NO grounds in my end product. So please disregard older comments about this issue if you're ordering this for the first time.Another main issue is about the leaking but if you screw the top on securely and shake any excess out into a sink before placing it back into the fridge that will prevent leakage. For just in case, it's good to have a paper towel under your brewer when placed on its side.",Yeassss!!! #coldbrewlife,"This Takeya cold brew coffee jug is wonderful! I know a lot of people use Mason jars, however, I wanted something easier to grab from the fridge and more lightweight (and cheaper!). I have used Takeya products before and have been impressed with their durability as well as the easiness of cleaning them. This cold brew jug has only 4 pieces; the jug, the handle, the lid, and the coffee filter. The coffee filter has an extremely fine mesh and it has not let through even the finest of coffee grounds. It is really easy to clean! The filter, after filling it with your favorite coffee (I find non-flavored coffee to taste best during the cold brew process) then screws into the lid. After you have filled up the jug about 85% of the way with filter water, you place the filter (already attached to the lid) into the water filled jug and screw it on! The coffee will have a great flavor within 8 hours, however, it is most potent by 24hrs and stays fresh up to 72hrs in my opinion. Remember, you are brewing a coffee concentrate as about 1 cup of grounds are used to brew. Mix with 2 parts water or you will... well, be like me that didn't read the directions and was up until 3am with a caffeine high, lol. Overall, I am really pleased with this purchase!If you found this review and pictures helpful in making a decision regarding purchasing this item, please let me know below :)",Should've bought it sooner!,"Great cold brew system! We had been putting off getting one for so long. We have a keurig and simply put brewed coffee in the fridge overnight. But as our keurig seems to be dying, it was time to explore other options. I wish we had done it sooner! This system is so easy to use - add your coffee of choice and water, place it in the fridge and wait for the next day. That's it!! So easy, great tasting coffee that goes far enough for both of us. It easily fits on a shelf or the door. We're considering buying a second because of how much coffee my husband drinks or if we have company.UPDATE:After a couple weeks of use I've noticed 2 flaws to call out. When inserting the filter into the water the grounds sometimes pop up to the top of the filter. This causes the grounds to get stuck and not submerge fully into the water to brew properly. I'm not terribly picky and haven't noticed a huge difference in taste or quality. The fix is easy - insert the filter into the water slowly and if needed tap the filter firmly on the side of the carafe. With a firm tap the grounds should fall to the bottom of the filter.Also, when you insert the grounds into the carafe and twist shut it will push water out if you‚Äôve overfilled it which some reviewers have identified as ‚Äúleaking‚Äù. Simple solution is to screw on the top and tip it over the sink to pour out any excess water. Once that‚Äôs done I haven‚Äôt had any problems with leaking.Given that these issues are easily fixed, have become 2-3 extra seconds of my routine, and there is no noticeable difference in taste/quality, I'm leaving my rating as 5 stars.","Lightweight, great filter and you can't beat the price!","I'm really liking this cold brew maker. At first I was saddened that it is 100% plastic and not glass but I realized that you could take something like this hiking/camping with you if you're the type of camper that needs their coffee right away when they first get up. I used to use a plain press-pot as my cold brewer but it'd leave sludge in the last cup; this has an extremely nice filter that is very fine and the whole thing is very easy to clean.Recommended tips: If you just fill the filter and then dip it into a full carafe of water the grounds will all be pressed up against the top of the lid. I personally fill the filter and place it in the empty carafe, then pour water through the filter and grounds until the carafe is full. Then I remove the filter and screw it into the cap and replace it back into the carafe. Shake a bit (just to be sure) and refrigerate!",Make great cold brew coffee for less,"I purchased this to make cold brew coffee at the office. My coworkers and I were going to the local siren at least 3-4 times a week for our afternoon pick me up. It was starting to become a serious drain financially. We all chipped in to get this pitcher and take turns buying beans. Get them ground for a French press, or super coarse, and you'll have a pretty good replica. The instructions for making cold brew are pretty easy. Of course you'll get some micro grinds that will make its way through the filter but that's to be expected. If you're OCD about it, you could pour it through a strainer or paper filter. Or just let it settle and pour gently. We've seriously cut down our caffeine expenditures by 50-75%. Now if we could figure out a way to order out less :)",49659,5,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FFLY64U

I really like it, I bought it for my roommate who was previously using milk crates stacked on top of one another like a heathen when we have this shelving unit technology at our fingertips. The color and feel is really nice, and I liked that it wasn‚Äôt genuine wood.My real complaint is with assembly. The instructions don‚Äôt actually help at all. There‚Äôs no definitive marks on the panels to specific which is which, and the instructions don‚Äôt have measurements to specify which either. It‚Äôll just say ‚Äúshorter‚Äù or ‚Äúlonger‚Äù which is definitely not helpful. I put it together wrong after a half hour, and had to reassemble it. It was a total headache. The boards also didn‚Äôt have enough screw holes on one side to allow for the block shaped section to be screwed in on both sides, even tho that‚Äôs what directions (I think) said to do. I ended up needing to just use nails since I didn‚Äôt have a power screwdriver.The unit, however, comes with a screwdriver, which I really appreciated! But I had to use it so much that I got a blister from it on my fingers so that sucked, but might just be my weird thin fragile skin. The corners of this unit are also weirdly sharp, I was stepping over it and literally cut my foot open. This however might be another example of my weird thing fragile skin. And also a sign I‚Äôm too clumsy to put these kinds of things together.The unit itself is sturdy, can hold a lot of textbooks, and is versatile. You can lay books however you want where ever! As long as your screws (and improv nails) are tight and secure enough, this shelf isn‚Äôt going anywhere. I was concerned with the weight limit, but it can easily hold all the textbooks that made her previous milk crate contraption bow in places. Additionally, how the two pieces stack, I couldn‚Äôt get that to happen seamlessly. There‚Äôs a little gap of either being off centered or needing to put something under the legs on the outside board to lift it up. That‚Äôs an actually annoying aspect, besides having to nail the piece in because it didn‚Äôt have premade holes for the screws.All in all, however, I would definitely buy this unit again! Just have someone with thick skin and picture-interpretation-reading skills put it together for me (seriously, there‚Äôs like, no words to follow!).",Excellent!,"I really like it! It's not too big, not too small. Easy to put together. I kind of wish that they would make another where it goes one more level up in the exact same way. It came with a screwdriver. The only problem is it was just a bit too big and they sent a flat head which is fine if it fit, but it would be better to send a philips head for the type of screws they put in it. I don't know if I just happened to get a bad one or not. The only thing that kind of irritates is they didn't send any of those little plastic pieces that cover up the screws so you don't know they're there.Pro:*Easy to put together*Comes with instructions*Comes with screwdriver*Comes with an extra screw just in caseCon:*Doesn't come with things to cover screw heads. This shows the screw and the little bit of wood.*If you don't like putting stuff together it could be a con for you.",Quick and Easy: Perfect for the Non-Handyman!,"I am not a ""handyman""--if I was, I would probably have built something like this from scratch. As it is, I can't nail two pieces of wood together, so this was just what I needed.I've put a few bookshelves together in my time, so I wasn't completely green when it comes to working with a kit. This kit comes with all the screws you need (plus one, of course), and a screwdriver. The screwdriver is not exactly a Craftsman, but it does the job. It's dual-sided--Phillips and flat head--though you'll only need the Phillips head.I followed the directions and managed to put together both parts to the shelving in under thirty minutes while sat on my couch.Two suggestions for the manufacturer:1. Use photographs as opposed to drawings on the directions. I was able to follow them, but photos would be clearer.2. Provide some means to clamp or secure the two parts together. I get the idea of having two separate parts. It means you can configure the desk shelving according to your needs. However, I can see them sliding apart (e.g., if there are strong vibrations in the room, or perhaps a book falling over) unless you have something heavy weighing each piece down. If this is a problem, and you're secure in your handyman skills, you could screw or nail the parts together once you have them configured to your liking. But then you're stuck with it like that.To sum up, this is well-made, easy to assemble, and perfect for the non-handyman.",It looks just like the picture...once I got the screws.,"I wasn't sure about ordering this after I received the package sans screws, but the seller was fantastic! They were polite and prompt when I told them I was missing the screws to put this together. Within a week I had my missing parts.Now, this is very heavy wood. I was impressed for the price, and once I figured out how this shelving system works I was even more impressed. It is expandable to fit the needs of the consumer. Right now, mine is holding twelve books, four journals, my smudging set, wax seals and wax, a crystal ball, a scrying amulet, and various other essentials in the space that once only held my envelopes and a dvd drive. Great way to create more space! If you have a smaller office area this is something you need to clean up the clutter!",Great addition to my new desk,"After looking for a nice shelf for my new desk at work and reading the various reviews, I decided on the Jerry & Maggie - Desktop Organizer Office Storage Adjustable Rack. I went with black since pretty much everything (besides my desk) is black. It arrived very quickly and I quickly put it together as IT was setting up my PC. The product sheet arrived listing the contents and instructions. I went thru each piece and they all had a sticker for what piece number they represented. There were supposed to be 12 screws but in my bag had 13. Which imo is great incase you lose one when putting it together. All the holes lined up perfectly and the recessed for the screw heads all were wide enough too. Yes, as others mentioned there are no screw covers but imo that isn't a big deal. I'm looking for function. If someone wants to look and gripe about my screws showing - they can get out of my office! LOLI honestly have to say I'm extremely impressed with this little fella. I have about a 3 inch gap from the wall to my desk but with this leaning against the wall it is still extremely sturdy and I'm not worried about putting stuff on it. I may eventually pick up a board to put under it and make the below a bit more user friendly but that's not due to the shelf but the desk placement. Putting this together was about the easiest I've ever had with how great everything lined up.The icing on the cake is that they include an interchangeable screwdriver in the box so you don't even have to go searching for one! It's both a Phillips and a flathead.I highly recommend this for anyone looking to add some extra space to their desk. Mine isn't full of course in the pictures as half of my stuff is still in my other office. But I'm very happy with this purchase.",7326,659,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078CQX2V5

Over the years we have tried almost every possible brand of coffee, grinding our own beans, and several brands of espresso machines including pre-packaged brands with pods.We've found Nespresso to be the most consistent and the best at not giving us jitters while still providing the ""boost"" we love. While we still use purchased beans and grind our own to run through our espresso machine for our double shot morning espresso, the Nespresso is of course much quicker and handier so we use it for our quick after lunch or evening espresso. Having learned that Nespresso pods can be recycled through their own process (they are made of aluminum), we now save them for recycling.Our choice for a good, strong, black espresso is this one, Ristretto.",Update of my review,The coffee is great but the product arrives with many of the cap damage only I open 2 box and I have maybe half damage .Updating ..... great service I contact amazon and they send me a replacement . Everything perfect thanks amazon thanks nespresso .,Better than coffee,I have the great fortune of having family that like to abuse my Nespresso machine like its a coffee vending machine and treat themselves to ample servings every morning when they stay with us. These pods provide the appropriate level of richness and quantity to satisfy their impetus. I have in the past attempted to reason with their avaricious appetites for countless cups of ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù to no avail. The idea of delighting in a single automated delicious espresso shot bewilders their baby booming dispositions. So for their bang for my buck I use these pods to feed their vehement necessity while at the same time satisfying my more appreciative nature. üòé,Flawless shipping with a great product,"I received my nespresso 4 years ago and I‚Äôve been through some different phases but I have been ordering this flavor in 50 count for at least 2 years. I think I‚Äôve tried placed around 30 orders. I always comes the same way, inside a box with my 5 boxes of 10 each. I can see from other reviews that some people get theirs in a shopping bag. It seems like maybe different warehouses pack things differently. Anyhow I was saying that mine don‚Äôt come in bent, they are always flawless.",Great coffee but bent capsules,"The coffee is outstanding. With these I can make a better cappuccino than just about any coffee shop i've been to, excepting of course Onyx Coffee Lab in Bentonville,AR, Duluth Coffee Company in Duluth MN and Taste of Rome in Sausalito. Follow the Nespresso guideline for ml per pull. I use 3 capsules per drink. Stretching the shots makes the espresso bitter. The unfortunate thing is that Amazon mails these in a padded envelope which is not enough to protect the capsules from getting bent. Ordering direct from Nespresso gets you a better box.",6601,609,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0752DX1CY

I found this projector, and looking past the ""for kids"" marketing I found a LOT of value packed into this little guy. Now that I have the projector, here's what I found:1. It powers from my Ravpower powerbank perfectly. No issues, just plugged it in. How cool is that? Time for some videos with the fam out in the woods.1. It's small and light! Easily carried in a backpack for those hike-in overnighters.2. The brightness is definitely much brighter when powered from a wall outlet. Maybe even 50% brighter. A very noticeable difference, so I'd recommend using the wall outlet as much as possible. The closer to a surface you set the projector, the brighter the picture will be, but also smaller. The closest I could get this to a wall and still get a focused picture was about 2 feet, which produced 1.5 foot picture. But the brightness definitely surprised me!3. The projector has a little speaker on the back that can get really loud, in a good way. Obviously not a Bose stereo system, but does the job well without needing an external speaker (although there is a headphone jack for just such a use-case, but no bluetooth connection). Use the included remote control to adjust the volume.4. The remote control is very responsive (and required for many of the menu options in the settings as the projector itself doesn't have up and down arrows, just left and right). You'll need 2 AAA batteries for the remote which are not included in this product.5. There's a little screw mount (standard size) on the bottom of the projector for a tripod. I recommend picking up a small, cheap tripod so the angle of projection can be easily adjusted. Keep in mind tho, there is no keystone adjustment.5. I got my Roku Stick, Chromecast, and Apple TV all to work through the HDMI port without issue. Again, just plugged them in and switched the source to HDMI. Looks and sounds fantastic. And from either the Chromecast or the Apple TV I was able to wirelessly cast my iPhone and iPad screens to the projector. Super convenient!6. The picture quality and brightness will not match a more expensive projector. The edges of the projected screen were noticeably darker and fuzzier than the middle, but nothing that gets in the way of an immersive experience once media is played. I've really enjoyed using this little guy!All in all, you can't beat the value and features on this little projector. I mean, it works great, but if the kids drop it or hypothetically after a couple years it stops working, you're only out a fraction of the cost of typical projectors. I highly recommend!",Great bang for buck!,"This really did exceed my expectations. For starters you can run this projector off of a portable USB battery pack so long as your pack pushes out at least 2.0 amps (2.4 recommended). You would do this by using a usb A to micro B cable which is not included. What is included is a wall power plug. This projector only works well in settings where there is almost no light which makes sense as the projector does not require a lot of power. My room is about 12‚Äô long and at a 12‚Äô display distance the horizontal width displays at around 8‚Äô. Great little projector for the portability. Please note this projector does have a manual focus adjustment in the side but does not have a keystone setting. The USB port on the side is also capable of powering a fire stick or roku stick, both of which I have tried successfully.","Portable, compact, and excellent quality","I purchased one of these projectors just before Christmas to gift to my sister-in-law. Since then, she has loved it and I loved it. She has played movies for her children and enjoyed her movie nights on the wall of her bedroom in the comfort of her bed. I loved hearing and seeing how great the projector gift was for her that I ordered another one for myself.It is just a bit wider than my Samsung Galaxy S6 and about two inches thick. Its compact and portable. We can't wait to use it at night outdoors by our poolside. We've used it with our Amazon fire stick and attached a portable charger for flexibility. I plan on taking it on our next camping trip as well!*****Here is my sister-in-laws review and picture:***I've seen mini projectors for a while now and have been hesitant to purchase one with concerns about the picture and quality of the projector. This projector certainly eased my concerns. It is tiny, approximately the size of an Xbox One controller and very light weight. The picture is pretty good all things considered. I am glad to have it. Depending what you are using for the video you may need an adapter. I love that you can connect an Amazon Fire directly into the HDMI port. The only problem I have is that the volume doesn't seem to work with some Apps (HBO Max and Netflix) on my iPhone.","Overall, very pleased","I bought this to replace a different projector that I very much liked. I chose to try this one instead because of its small size and how cute it is! Overall, I'd give it a 4.5 if half stars were an option.Why I like it:-It's small/compact-Easy for travel-The built in speaker gets good volume. If you want good sound, you definitely want to use an external speaker via aux cord, but the level of volume on this is better than other projectors I've used.-The remote is light but solid and controls the volume (my old one had one volume setting)Issues:-The first one I bought came with scratches on the lens (see last photo). I didn't notice it on the picture, but you expect a brand new projector to be clear of scratches. I exchanged it for another, and it was perfectly fine. I also exchanged it for the next reason to see if it was a fluke.-The right side of the image (on both projectors) is slightly blurry and smaller. It's like the image or lens doesn't sit straight. It's hardly noticeable and most people probably wouldn't see it. Basically, if the left side is perfectly clear, the right isn't quite clear and vice versa.Ultimately, I am keeping the projector and am very happy with it. It's good quality for the price. The image is great. It's bright and clear (apart from the weirdness of the right side). I have an Apple TV that I use with it, but you can use anything that connects via HDMI. It comes with an HDMI cord, remote, red/white/yellow cord.It is basic, and you can't tilt the image up and down, so you pretty much have to have the projector and the height of your screen/where you want it, which is kind of a bummer but mostly not a problem for me as I am using it inside and can set it up high. I imagine that it will work well outdoors, though I can't speak to that and you'll need to have it higher up than others.",Perfect for the Price!,"This projector is so easy to use! The brightness is great if you are running it off wall power, you can run it off a battery pack but it has about half the brightness. If you are getting it for a portable projector, it would work better at night or in super low light settings.As a projector you plug into the wall it is perfect for what we need. It isn't wireless but the main reason we would want wireless is for steaming off our phones to the projector and many of the wireless projectors out there will not allow you to cast the major streaming apps (Netflix, Disney +, etc.) from your phone. So we just bought a firestick for $30 and use the USB port to power the Firestick and we have a great portable entertainment center for under $100! Would highly recommend this projector!",2464,702,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B8DKYPS

I left it on my car for a few months in variant weather and never charged it or used it. This morning I plugged it in for maybe 45 min and it was 1/2 charged. My phone went down to 3% and I got terribly lost in an unfamiliar place and needed to use Google maps and I knew that would kill my phone. I plugged in my phone to the charger and walked for 20+ minutes using my phone ,and got to where I'm going. Then left my phone to charge more and it charged all the way to 80% before running out of juice. I am very impressed that even sitting without use and in a hot car, this thing still worked great. I feel like it was definitely worth the money and am so glad I bought it.",Free Yourself From the Wall Outlet,"If you're looking for peace of mind every time you leave the house, this power bank doesn't disappoint. It's the size of a credit card and only a hair heavier than my iPhone 6 making it extremely portable without being bulky and heavy. There's a power button you press which shows how much power is left via 4 blue leds (when it's dead, only one led will flash). You can only charge one device with this power bank but I'm always impressed by how quickly this charges my iPhone 6 (from 10% to near full takes approximately 1 hour). So far, I've been able to charge my phone about 4 times from near empty to full before having to charge the power bank. It comes with a usb cable to charge the power bank itself as well as a drawstring pouch. Since I hate carrying around the long original lightning cable from Apple, I bought the 1 foot ""Double Braided Nylon Anker PowerLine+ Lightning Cable"" which is the perfect size.What I love the most about this power bank is how effective it's been. The power bank itself requires at least 2 hours to charge from empty to full but once charged, your phone will charge to full in less time. As a result, I haven't charged my phone using a wall outlet since I bought this power bank more than a week ago. Not having to worry about my phone going dead or being near a wall outlet is the best feeling next to purchasing a new phone.So if you want a reliable power bank that charges your phone in no time and frees you from being attached to a wall outlet, GET THIS!",Great charger,"Update: I‚Äôve had this for like two years now. Still works great! I‚Äôve taken it on so many trips. I‚Äôve been able to charge my iPhone, and GoPro batteries all with one charge. This thing has been a great purchase.So far so good. I've used it a couple of times and I've been able to charge my iPhone 6S at least 3 times with one charge. I really like the light that tell you how much power is still left. It's also pretty small so it doesn't take up a lot of space.",A Must-Have,"Works so well I bought all the colors (helps to keep track as family tends to hijack them) Perfect for giving my iPhone 6s some staying power. Use constantly all day and night without worry. A must have on vacations as a day out in Vegas will easily drop u to 0 after pics and videos or navigation. Durable, effective, compact. Heads up, the black charger was a tad longer, didn‚Äôt even realize it until now. Also, can charge to to 100% quick but its almost a false reading as it drains really fast. I keep one with me in my EDC bag and at work at all times. It‚Äôs helped out friends and clients as well. Charges iPhones well but an iPad mini will zap this to nothing so stay away from larger electronics. Buy it, buy 2 of them!",Impressed,"I ordered two of these, one for my wife and one for me, after about a week of reading reviews on Amazon for lots of different makers and sizes.My wife has an iPhone 6S and I have the 6S+. We fully charged our Powercores overnight after they arrivied Monday evening. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings, we both used them to recharge our phones from about 15% to fully charged. My Powercore has just started flashing on one light left at 90% on the phone. That's almost three full charges on a 6S+. I use my phone for reading, FB and games in the evening, my wife tends to text and play solitaire. Her Powercore is still showing 3/4 full. We both have our Powercores charging the phone while using. Pretty impressive.To the people who gave 1or 2 stars because the Powercore comes with a charging cable that doesn't fit your phone --- use the one which came with your phone, you know, the one with a USB at one end and the other end goes in your phone? You should find the USB end fits the Powercore. We just bought two 3 foot lighting cables to keep in the bag that stores the Powercore and it's charging cable.

In my nearly 30 years of existence, I‚Äôve never been satisfied with a pair of headphones. I probably have the weirdest shapes ears ever because nothing fits them. Either they slide out or hurt, or both.Day 1- FINALLY THEY‚ÄôRE HERE!!! üòç I charged them while finishing my work day up (I think they came pretty much charged because they were at 100% within 5-10 minutes) then eagerly headed to the park for a test run. The temp has reached the 90‚Äôs here in Mississippi so it was inevitable that they would be receiving a sweat test! After 3 miles (41 minutes, let me mention I‚Äôm a beginner runner) I realized I never had to adjust them or push them back into my ear, not ONCE! I‚Äôm thinking this is too good to be true! I had forgotten I even had them on, other than the fact that I had a clean crisp bass playing in my ears. I also own a pair of Studio beats, and honestly these ear buds sounds almost as good... which is pretty awesome to not have to wear something so bulky but still have the noise cancellation and sound quality.Overall, it‚Äôs only been one day but my first impression is absolutely amazed.Side note, these were shipped in a box big enough to fit a baby heifer and it looked like it had been thrown off a mountain. I could almost remove the tiny product box through an opening of the baby heifer shipping box. Not sure if Amazon or UPS is to blame for that, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt the headphones fault.",Glad I waited for the Powerbeats Pro!,"I want to preface this before I say anything about these headphones: I primarily use headphones for music and podcasts while I am cycling, running, or sitting at my desk at work. I use Spotify for music, and I am not an audiophile. I am not comparing these to a pair of Sennheisers with a lossless audio format as my source. I also am using an iPhone 7+ and iPad Air 2 for my devices in this review.I have been waiting on a getting a pair of truly wireless headphones because none seemed to be worth it to me. The battery life is usually dismal for obvious reasons, and most had complaints of cutouts between the earbuds. Some friends of mine have Air Pods and they all said they didn‚Äôt have cutout issues and battery life was pretty good. But, I just didn‚Äôt like the design of the Air Pods and they sounded ‚Äúhollow‚Äù to me. But I get their appeal.I am so glad I waited for the Powerbeats Pro (PBP)! I was using the Jaybird X3 before I got these, and I think the sound is on par with them. One of my main annoyances with the X3‚Äôs was that the cord would tug once sweat built up on my neck while exercising, and I couldn‚Äôt use the cable shortener they provide because of the way my helmet is. I went for a bike ride yesterday with the PBP‚Äôs, and they were fantastic! It was a little windy, so I did get a little wind noise. I am hoping Comply makes some tips for these because I think that would make the noise isolation much better. My ride was around 2 hours and I still had 80% left on the PBP battery.Cons:1. The case: it‚Äôs actually smaller than I thought, but would still be uncomfortable in a pocket. I think the 9 hour battery life on the actual headphones make this acceptable, but this may be deal breaker for some.2. Ear fatigue: I didn‚Äôt have any fatigue during my ride, but my ears were definitely a little sensitive where the hook was resting after I took the headphones off. I‚Äôm hoping this gets better as I wear them.3. Like the Air Pods, the PBP‚Äôs can only be connected to one device at a time. They will pair to all Apple devices on your iCloud account, but if you want to switch between devices, you have to go into your Bluetooth settings and select them. On Android you will need to pair each device separately.4. I usually listen to a podcast when I go to sleep. These are not comfortable to lay on if you are side sleeper like I am. Also, the button the headphones will get pushed by the pillow. The button doesn‚Äôt require much force, which is great because your not shoving the headphones into your ear. Not a huge deal, but just thought I would mention it.Pros:1. Great sound for Truly wireless, I think.2. Great fit for exercise.3. Pretty good sound isolation, but like I said, I am hoping Comply makes some tips for these.4. Actual headphones are smaller than I thought they would be, and they don‚Äôt look weird on you when you are just walking down the street.Bottom line, if you use an iOS device and use headphones while exercising, I can‚Äôt recommend these enough! In my opinion, the $250 price tag is worth it given where other truly wireless headphones are priced.","If you workout, better than any high end wireless headphones/earphoes","Battery life, and sound quality is absolutely perfect. The earphones hold perfectly in place even during HIIT, and the sweat resistant makes it better than apple AirPods. The charging case is indeed a bit bulky, but doesn't marginalize the value of this earphones. yes, it is pricey, and could have been $50 less, but its beats!Update:After 10 days of usage, so far the product has lived upto the standards. Fit is snug. I've been running, and training in the 90 degree Fahrenheit sun in Louisiana, no smell and issues due to sweat whatsoever. The phone call quality is still impeccable and helps reduce sound. batter life went on for unto 7 days with 90 minutes of usage everyday.",They Sound Good,"First off, SUPER comfortable and secure. I've only been able to use Earhook headphones for ANYTHING even walking as normal Earphones just fall out and in ear headphones will fall out eventually do to sweat and jaw movement. These things are awesome cause they dont penetrate the ear canal rather they sit and seal right outside the canal. The sounds is good for your avg listener but im not WOWed by the base as most reviews have pointed out its punchy but I dont care for it cause it just sounds good as my Anker Soundcore Spirit X, maybe a tad punchier. Back to the fit. Its good for big eared people like me. I've switched to the smallest silicone fitting because it doesnt seal my ear canal so I can hear everything going on around me while also enjoying the headphones. I know, that defeats the purpose of the seal but its an option if you're out in public and need to know whats going on around you. Love the auto off when removing from your ear. Not looking back on this purchase as expensive as it was, its the best earphones I've ever used.",PERFECT FIT! Best gym headphones you can buy!,"First I need to start with the fact that I‚Äôm EXTREMELY picky when it comes to headphones and I‚Äôve bought over 20 pairs from Amazon from brands to no brands. These are the first pair of headphones that I‚Äôve worn to the gym that have not needed a single adjustment! I have weird ears and no in ear headphones have ever fit me this well. The seal is great and it just doesn‚Äôt move! Ok so quick pros and cons:Pros:Amazing fitGood sealGreat battery life (easily a day of on and off full use from 5am to 10pm)Cons:The bass isn‚Äôt as deep as other in ear Beats unit but is good enoughThe mic quality isn‚Äôt amazing, I‚Äôve had a few people say it isn‚Äôt very clear, passable but I‚Äôll use others for workNo other cons!I love them - I honestly didn‚Äôt want to at $250 but to be able to get through workouts without having to CONSTANTLY touch my ears and move the headphones around, man it feels great and for me is worth the price tag! üëä",62136,4,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R5QD598

I would recommend this table.",A Table for the Ages,"This is exactly the table I wanted. The legs on either end come down in one piece. To put the legs back in place, stand the table on end and push the middle part of the leg ""studier/lock-er"" in a bit (after finagling to get that metal loop out of the way), and then you can fold the leg into the bottom of the table. It locks in place. Repeat other side. This is a very lightweight and sturdy table, easy to maneuver.This is NOT a fold-in-half table. Nowhere does the description indicate that.Pros:1. Table stands when legs are dropped into place. This is very important, in my estimation, perhaps top consideration.2. Fairly easy to engage and disengage legs (minor quibbles, as listed in CONS section below).3. Lightweight, easy to move around.4. It's one solid surface, so working a puzzle on it would be fine (I had that fold-in-half table with adjustable legs -- hated EVERYTHING about it), as would many other uses.5. Great project table! (I think it would be fine to hold a sewing machine for a project, but I cannot speak to long-term use for sewing or anything of weight -- the bigger table *might* be what people seem to have problems with, but it's hard to tell). This seems pretty solid.CONS:1. The metal ring helps provide stability when the legs are engaged, but it's kind of a pain to get it out of the way of the hinge part when trying to disengage the legs.2. The folding bars for the legs are thin (sturdy enough for the legs). My hands haven't done much manual labor in over 30 years and are very sensitive to the thinness when trying to pop the folding part. I would recommend a rag, at least for my use.3. The crossbar that braces the legs on either end is at the perfect height to hit my shins if I'm not careful. Cause me great pain once, shame on you, table. I will avoid great pain twice.4. I was about to buy a second one of these tables, but the price nearly doubled from from when I bought it to today. Yikes! This is a great table, but I thought it was a little high-priced when I bought it ($67). It's not a good deal for over $100 -- unless you're desperate.

The tray is thin plastic so i can see how this might crack if the package is abused in shipping as other reviewers have noted. I plan on using this to save my back when detailing a few cars so will update this review later once I put it through the paces. Very good first impression. Plus my kids love their coronavirus, shelter in place plaything ;)JULY 23rd: Update after a few months. This has served me and my back well when washing and detailing cars. My wife used it too when painting a bed frame. It is holding up well. Very comfortable and functional and easy to move around when normally you would be on your knees and/or bending over. The tray is nice to keep supplies in arms reach as you role from one end of your project to another. Highly recommend!",Really like,"I don't understand some of the complaints here. This thing came in perfectly, took about 10 minutes to put together, and all parts were perfect.I find myself using this a lot more often than I thought. I don't use the tool area that much, but it's really handy when working on my motorcycle or working on brakes, or anything that's low.When I'm done, I just kick it over to my work bench and it slides right underneath.It's light enough to easily carry.I'm kind of fat now - let me blame it on Covid - over 250 pounds and it has no problem supporting my fat self.So I really like this thing.",This little rolling seat made it possible to do a back breaking job.,"Well, my job is to remove bits of carpet pad stapled into the sub floor for 6 rooms. I curse the installers but the rolling cart has made it not such a horrible job. I'm old and can't really get on my hands and knees and stay there for long, nor can I bend over or squat down for long. I could maybe sit on the floor and scoot along but the floor is dirty.

It's a snug, wetsuit-like fit; all you need to do is stretch it a little bit to pull the zipper around the top of the computer. I have a leather backpack that's not laptop-specific (no compartments or dividers, no zippers, just a top flap) and this is the perfect solution. I like the idea of another reviewer who suggested a version with a size zip, since a lot of bags won't accommodate a laptop inserted sideways and it might enable you to take out of your pack without removing the case itself. But it's a minor thing, really.It's also worth noting that this case is not intended to provide maximum armor-like protection from drops, so you'll be disappointed if that's what you need. It's great for protecting against bumps, jostles, and hard/pointy objects (keys, pens, whatever) that might scratch your expensive investment. It's probably not the best choice for people who are hard on their equipment. For example, my fianc√©e runs a dance company and is constantly throwing her laptop into her bag and running out the door to rehearsals and work with the sound/lighting technicians, so that computer changes hands (and places) A LOT. She needs, and uses, something a lot more robust. This case is for commuting and coffee shops, not modern warfare. Of course, you could always buy a bigger size and use it in tandem with a hard case if you really want to go nuts.If I had to find something to criticize, it's that the material tends to attract pet hair and if it's short, like my vizsla's, it can be a pain to remove. Otherwise, It's just a simple, well-made product and an absolute bargain.",Works with NEW MacBook Pro w/Touchbar (2016),"The 14-inch sleeve is a perfect fit for the new MacBook Pro 15 w/Touchbar (Late 2016). I was looking for a neoprene sleeve that would fit snug around the now smaller in size 15-inch MacBook Pro. This is the solution. Fits like it was made for it, no slop side-to-side or top-to-bottom. It is a good quality case with a well constructed body, decent padding on the sides and a excellent zipper.",Five stars for price/value ratio,"At nearly half price of one, buying a ten pack is a good deal. If only Amazon offered the 10 pack in other colors with a similar discount, we'd be in heaven. From the large box, each unit comes wrapped in plastic and a little bit of packaging material and silica gel inside which you'll dispose right away. There's a little but of neoprene/plastic smell when opening up for the first time but I don't know of any sleeves that don't have an odor at first.They fit our company issued MacBook Pro 13"" laptops great -- both the current and older generations. There's no pocket or other storage on the outside of the sleeve, so inside is what you get. The protection is minimal, but if you're stuffing your laptop in a backpack or other container anyways, this is really all you need. I haven't heard any complaints from our staff nor do I see any problem with the zipper closure or general durability of the case.Nope, not expecting these to save a laptop from a 10 foot fall on concrete, but should be fine for smaller drops and just to generally keep protected. Will it last 20 years? Probably not, but for this price, who cares. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase more of these ""basic"" sleeves knowing the limitations and for simple protection.",Simply a great slip case,"My Chromebook doesn't do much traveling, so I ordered this sleeve for a bit of protection around the house. Like all AmazonBasics products, it's of very high quality, and certainly doesn't disappoint. There is excellent padding all around, and the zipper is very sturdy.For Asus owners: Contrary to some claims I've read in Q&A's and reviews here, the 15.6-Inch version fits my Asus C523NA Chromebook beautifully, and with room to spare. All one need do is a bit of math: This laptop model is 14‚Äùx10‚Äù, and the inner dimensions of the case are 16""x11.5"". The entire affair also easily slips into my Dell Premier Backpack 15, for when I do bring it along to wherever I happen to be going.I ordered the gray version, which matches the color of this Asus Chromebook perfectly.This sleeve gets my highest recommendation, especially considering the extremely reasonable price. There's simply no way to beat it.","can't go wrong with this... perfect for 13.3"" laptops or chromebooks!",,80078,25,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011J4BWUM

We had an HP printer that was so problematic that we literally lit it on fire in the back yard with a flamethrower. (Not even an exaggeration. We lit it on *actual fire*.)So I was dubious about buying anything else HP, to say the least.This paper, though, has been like a revelation. If a paper could cause the heavens to open up and angels to sing, it would be this paper. It is very smooth, much thicker than you'd expect for a 32# paper, and a gleaming white that scans and prints flawlessly.I use it for artwork, in addition to regular laser printing. I use carbon ink and a brush to draw things, and with its super-smooth, bright white surface, this paper has been amazing. There's almost no cockling (wavy, wet-paper buckling), and with most pens and inks, not even any show-through because of the weight. I've also used it to make traveler's notebook inserts, and even with my wettest fountain pens, there's no show-through, bleeding, or ghosting. It's pretty much perfect.My one tiny (and I mean super tiny, barely worth mentioning, but I'm struggling to try to give a complete review here) ""complaint"" is that flipping through sheets is a little more difficult, since it's so firm and smooth -- turning pages or flipping between sheets one by one can be difficult without moistened fingers. (Also, the risk of paper cut is real -- this stuff is thick and vaguely sharp. Like, y'know, *good paper*.) It's a minor thing, but if you're prone to papercuts, or you have finger mobility issues, you may want to keep a finger moistener dealiemabobber or a rubber finger cover thingie for collation.tl;dr -- this paper is the Mary Poppins of papers. Practically perfect in every way.",I use this to keep my printer up to snuff.,"I run one ream of this paper through my HP printer on every third ream. This is thicker paper and tends to clean out some of the junk in the printer from the cheaper paper. It also firms up the rollers in the printer. Its not meant to be a cleaning paper but i have found using this in my HP printer once ever 3-4 reams of cheaper paper really extends the life of the printer and keeps it cleaner. as for the quality of this paper, its thicker and ultra bright which is really nice so I try to save my printing of nice items for when i have this paper. Its also good as a less expensive alternative to matte photo paper. or lighter heavy cards stock.","super smooth, heavyweight paper","Like so many others, I also bought this paper to practice calligraphy on. Saw several people insisting this was the paper to use in the reviews of *other* calligraphy practice papers and that got my attention.This paper is smooooth! If you're tactile, it's nice just to run your hand over it. (people may look at you strangely though)It is great for practice paper. So far, none of the 4 kinds of ink I've used have bled -- 2 calligraphy inks, a fountain pen ink, and a sumi ink. It drags on nibs less than any other paper I have (so far). It's inexpensive enough and comes in a large enough amount that you can use it willy-nilly if you're so inclined. But it's also thick enough and nice enough you could use it for a finished project.I will definitely be buying this paper again. The only change I'll make is instead of 32 I'll try 28 or 24. 32 is too thick to clearly see grid lines without a lightbox. It's very noticeably thicker/heavier than regular printer paper. I'd like something in-between just for practicing.The packaging I got is different from the one shown on the product page. As far as I can tell, what I got is what HP sells now.",Interesting paper for pen and ink,"I'm giving this paper five stars because it is a high quality, smooth finish paper. It's printer paper, and not tailored for pen and ink, but I got it for pen and ink because I read a few remarks online that it's good for that.I tried three colors of Varsity disposable fountain pens (black, turquoise, and red) and the results varied. The black ink didn't feather much at all, resulting in a thin line. The turquoise feathered a lot. The paper seemed to be pulling a lot of ink from the nib. The red was somewhere in between, with a little feathering.I also tried three colors of ultra fine Sharpies (again, black, turquoise, and red). The black did okay, but the paper seemed to dry out the turquoise and red pens almost on contact. Maybe in this case the paper wasn't absorbent *enough* to start the ink.I tried Pilot G2 gel pens (same three colors) and got good results, but the paper is so smooth it seemed like it wasn't giving the roller balls a lot of traction, so there was some minor skipping.These comments may sound like complaints, but I'm happy with the paper and will continue to use fountain pens with it. And maybe gel pens sometimes. And of course mechanical pencils. The paper's smooth finish works very nicely with those.",Excellent paper!,"This is easily the best laser paper I can find. I have several reams of the 24/28/32lb Premium papers. The 24 is great for just everyday prints etc, and the 32 is great for photos and graphics that I print once in awhile. But the 28lb in my opinion is just the perfect balance. I use the 28 for anything that I want a nice printout for, not to thick and not to thin. The 32lb can be a little ridiculous for everyday things and the 24lb can be flimsy sometimes, therefor making 28 the best. :) Anyway that's my thought process. I recently ordered the Xerox Bold 28lb in search for paper that is better then the HP Premium Paper. Xerox makes great paper, but I don't know if it will be able to top the HP. I've run the HP paper through my Xerox Versalink C405, 5000 prints and not a single jam or print problem.",3944,409,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NBJKYTU

It's loud, it's precision airflow nozzle is a bit wider than you would like, but it is POWERFUL. The air flow is at least three times stronger than compressed air cans, and it can be used longer than a compressed air can. Additionally, it's always available (well, if you have a power outlet), and includes a fairly bright little light to show where the beam of air is going. There are three tips, three brushes, three filter pads, and a bag of... well, goop, designed to pick up crumbs and such from keyboards. Not sure the goop will ever be needed, as this little guy is POWERFUL enough to get the detritus of keyboard snacks out from under your keys.However, there is one significant downside... the more you use it, the hotter it gets, both to hold, and for the airflow. You may want to be careful using it near hot electronics, and turning the electronics on immediately after use. The air is easily enough to overheat an already hot CPU, kind of the opposite of compressed air cans.I recommend this over the cans... Its better for the environment, more powerful, and cheaper, in the long run, if you need to blast dirt and dust out of electronics, hard to reach places like under you fridge or strove, etc. It's not a leafblower or snowblower, but it's nearly in those kinds of ranges. It'll do you well.",AMAZING!,,"You gotta have one of these, if you own a computer.","If you're still using canned air, then you need this. This blower is incredible, fast, powerful, and cleans thoroughly as the air is blown over your dusty devices. I used it on two computers and it was amazing. The older of the two computers had dust heavily laden on the power box fan and the cooling fan. I couldn't get the dust off with canned air, so I bought this blower. It cleaned the cpu cooling radiator, radiator fan blades, the heat sinks, and the fan in the graphics card, making them look like new. Computer runs much cooler already. Make sure you use a grounding strap from your arm to the machine. If you don't have one, buy one, they're inexpensive and will save your electronics from static electrical charges. Peace, out.",Powerful,"I bought this so I can stop buying cans of compressed air. This will do the job nicely. It has a lot more power than I was expecting - I was blowing stuff off my table the first time I used it. It was able to clean most of my keyboard with ease.It also has an LED light at the end. This is a good ideas so you can see the area you are cleaning.Noise level - loud! I'd say it is about as loud as my Shop Vac. However, you probably won't need to run it very long as it blasts out a lot of air with a good amount of pressure.The description for the product should be updated. It says it is a vacuum cleaner. It is a blower. It does not do the job of a vacuum.This also came with a pack of Super Clean. It's a slime-like (gel?) material that does a great job of picking up small particles. This works well for detailing items (like my keyboard). I also used it on some speaker grills - it gets most of the stuff in the mesh.This device will easily pay for itself within about 6 months in my house.",Great power and dusting,I've tried many of these types of dusters and most have been weak and nothing like a can of compressed air. Not this thing. This thing has power. I immediately took it on a dusting spree. It was great. No more cans of compressed air for me.,5553,606,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083LNC6NR

I‚Äôm super happy with the way they look. Just take the instructions step by step and they aren‚Äôt too hard. I put all four together by myself.,The snowball finally has its chance!,"For inexpensive furniture which isn't designed to last, Sauder has been a decent alternative to bankrupting families to fill their homes.Over the years, Sauder has been hit or miss (usually miss), as ""furniture"" usually deteriotes either by weak structure design or the fake wood paper starts to peel off.I was very skeptical at purchasing this due to history, but there have been some good pieces. For the price, the look, and the color, I took a chance.I am *extremely* impressed with this cabinet. It's very sturdy, looks incredible, and the doors don't look lopsided because the company finally used adjustable hinges (about time, Sauder!).Construction took about 30 minutes, and the instructions easy to follow with one exception: there is a section instructing us to slide on an edge piece, but there is no indication on which direction it is to be applied. This piece is what is seen above the doors, and if it's installed upside down, as I did, there is a gap between the shelf and doors.If this should happen to you, the correction is extremely simple: untorque one of the front edges (either side, doesn't matter), and lift it off. Then slide the piece off the board, flip it, and slide it back on. Reattach the edge and torque it down. Gap removed.I also enjoyed the contrasting ""aged wood"" shelving, which was a surprise since the images don't show really show this. You can see it on the shelf above the doors, but not the others. Quite a nice touch, adding a bit of charm to the overall design.Like most other Sauder cases, this also uses the thin backing which requires many nails to appy.Unfortunately, the backing does not have perforated sections to pop out, so if you intend to set electrical items on your shelves, it is highly recommended you measure and cut before you apply the backing. Don't make the mistake I did by thinking you can slide the cord out the side. Ugh, now I have to nail the backing and this means moving the shelf out. You'd think I'd learn by now.The width of the cabinet is about 30in/76cm, which is another reason I purchased it. I have a small area in a room that's about 31in/79cm, and this fit perfectly inside it. Despite being a ""thin"" cabinet, there is ample room on each shelf.Thanks to the addition of adjustable hinges (both for mounting and for door placement), this is the first Sauder set in which the doors look and operate perfectly. I hope Sauder continues using these hinges, because it's worth the extra cost to customers to include them.This is the best Sauder piece I have ever purchased in the arena of ""self service"" furniture, and I've got to give props to Sauder for remaining competitive in this market now that that other store seems to be taking the spotlight.If you don't have one of these stores in your area, you might want to give Sauder a look. This came with free shipping, and believe me, that's a huge savings given how heavy this was.This ends my review and I hope it was helpful.Thanks for reading and have a great day.",Love them! Excellent customer service,"I love these bookcases! They were super easy to put together, I built 2 myself. But I have built things like this before over the years, comparatively these were very easy. The instructions are mostly pictures/diagrams with comedic comments. Very cute. The bookcases are very sturdy and if you put the hidden cams and cam locks in straight you will end up with a square shelf so that the back panel fits it perfectly. I love how they look in my great room, just wish they were taller as so many have said. They look super short bc of my 9 foot ceiling. I did have an issue with a shelf and trim but I reached out to Sauder Woodworking and they fixed the issue immediately! Can‚Äôt ask for anything more. Things sometimes happen when you order furniture online and have it shipped. I highly recommend, I would buy again. Also thinking of buying the matching console for my foyer.",Love it! Worth the money and effort.,"Finished product is sturdy and exactly same as product picture. I absolutely loves it especially the wooden top matches with our floor perfectly.The assembly takes time but instructions are easy to follow. Some steps require two people because the heavy weight. But most steps can be completed easily by one person. We recently purchased and assembled a dining set, bar stools, a coffee table, and a patio furniture set. I would rank this product‚Äôs difficulty level as medium compared with all other furniture I recently assembled.Overall for the price we paid, we are very happy with the purchase.",I love this bookcase,I love this bookcase. It's beautiful and fits my needs perfectly. I am even thinking about getting a second one. I love the natural wood look on the shelves and the white cabnet.

You can feel the difference!,"The quality of this paper is MUCH better than I expected. You can actually feel the difference compared to standard copy paper. It is more expensive than I would have liked, but considering I would have to travel twenty minutes each way to purchase a box of paper from my local store, having it delivered to me for free is something I couldn't pass up. Sometimes I order from office depot's website for a good deal, but I didn't see any deals this time around. Since I ordered this, I ordered from quill.com, which has good deals on paper and offers free shipping. I haven't tested the quality of that paper just yet, though.",Hammermill Copy Paper is the best,The paper has wonderful contrast and never jams in my HP 8600 Plus. I would suggest buying half the amount the next time as the box is extremely heavy and I believe that is why so many reams are missing and some are damaged in shipping. Mine was perfect. The price is great and the quality is the best. I have been using this product for 15 years.,"Good Standard Thickness Printer Paper, ZERO Problems with My HP LaserJet","I got the 8.5x11 20lb Copy paper in the 8-ream box, and it met my expectations for simply being standard printer paper like you'd expect and have had ZERO problems with them feeding or printing from my printers, single or double-sided. The paper is just regular light paper, doesn't seem too thin or cheap. Its as pliable as wrapping paper, and not a thick card stock. I filled my tray in my HP LaserJet Pro MFP M477fdw to the brim, and have been printing for standard home office use, usually double-sided, and never having a problem or second thought about the paper quality. I don't get any unreasonable bleed through other than what you would expect to faintly notice on two sided printing if there is light beneath the paper.After looking through a lot of choices online, and reading reviews of every brand and variant, all of which with some scary reviews out there, I gave this a try, hoping for just decent standard printer paper that works. None of the fearful review claims came true for me. Not unexpectedly thin. Zero jamming for me. I like that it comes in a convenient box for easy ream storage, shipped to your front door, and a pretty decent value. If I had one complaint, is that the paper wrapping on the reams themselves is thin and tears easily on the sides when the ream flexes as you pick them up. It doesn't really matter as the box itself is protective. But a thicker ream wrapping paper would feel more sturdy and protective. But I do like the paper sleeves as they are easier to use a partial ream than the store-bought clear plastic sleeves that shred to pieces when opened.Personally, I've had some thicker paper before that feels more sturdy and rigid than this. I've had GP paper that I just loved because it felt so sturdy and worked as well, and I've had some HP paper from a local store that felt like stronger card stock. I thought I had 20lb paper before, but maybe it was heavier stock. I wouldn't say this feels ""premium"" in nature. But as 20lb copy paper, I don't think I can expect more than being what it stated, arriving in good condition, and just working. Although it is hard to say I ""love"" this paper, there are no flaws to knock off a star in my book. If you really want a paper to feel more rigid than regular paper, I think you simply have to go >20lbs card stock.",great product horrible delivery,The delivery driver did not even knock on the door to let me know they were there. I am disabled and can not lift anything. So it will have to sit outside my door until i can get someone to pick it up and bring it in. The driver could have set it inside my apartment for me. I have asked my delivery driver on several occasions not to just drop boxes and run. This irritates me. I guess there needs to be a delivery instruction on every shipping area so the driver is aware of the purchasers ability to pick up a box.,My Husband's Favorite,"My husband isn't particular about much of anything, but when I was talking about needing new laser printer paper he said to get whatever it is we have been using for the last couple of years. We have been using this Hammermill 20 lb copy paper. The pages don't get stuck in the printer, they don't stick to each other and the ink looks crisp and clear.So, I ordered a box of 4,000 sheets because the price seemed more reasonable than ordering fewer reams at a time. I didn't think about how heavy the box would be. About 44 pounds. When it arrived and I tried to lift it I felt very bad for the delivery person. Luckily, he didn't have to carry it too far. I could open the box and move a few reams at a time. He couldn't.Good paper which should last us a long time.",31766,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072FVQNWM

I thought the braided cord would have a bit more quality and sturdiness. I don't see this lasting much longer in my car but so far it's working well for what I need. I'll likely update my review if it breaks in the next few months.EDIT:I am buying this again because despite what I thought initially this cord has lasted so long and I'm pretty rough with cords. I'm only buying again because I've seemed to have lost it due to travel which is upsetting but it's well worth the money and you definitely get more than you pay for, thanks for making good products at a reasonable price.Update: Dec 29 2018. I found the original cord so I didn't actually buy a new one. It's still working perfectly after over a year of use.Update:5/25/2020. Yall my cable is still working. It looks like absolute crap after spilling coffee on it but it still works and that's all that matters to me. I still don't need a replacement",Pay attention to what length of cord you are purchasing!,I ordered this cord for my car. So far it works great with no staticky sounds. Some people have this a bad review because the one they ordered was too short. Pay attention to what size you're ordering! I ordered the 3ft cord. It's the perfect length for use in the front seat. If you want something that will reach your back seat order the 6ft cord.,"Durable build quality, exceptional aux cable","I purchased this cable early 2019 and have used it daily. I've been meaning to write a review for some time now, but a recent encounter with an inferior, barely used cable has awoken me to write this review. This aux cord is for those who appreciate both exceptional sound and build quality. I've used this wire to hang my badge on after work before plugging in my phone for almost 2 years and is only recently starting to fray (see pictures). From being vigorously ripped out of the car stereo on occasion to falling into a cup of coffee, this cable can handle the abuse. This aux cord will outlive the aux port on today's phones, since most major companies are doing away with the 3.5mm headphone jack. If you're in the market for one, don't hesitate. This is the one.",Trust,"In revamping a component stereo system from 1987 to bluetooth, along with a flat panel TV from 2014, I've invested in about nine different bluetooth transmitters, which are electronically duct-taped to various inputs, RCA and otherwise, throughout my living room.I went with Cable Creation because I found the braided cloth cable and the gold contacts sturdy and reliable. I had some GRUESOME experiences with the cheap cords that came packaged with the Trond BT-DUO transmitter/receivers I'm [primarily] using; I didn't know whether these would improve the signal strength enough to get rid of the drop-outs and static I was experiencing ... but they did, AND arrived a day early.You can trust this brand. It would be great if everything else I've purchased for this project worked as consistently.",Just what I needed!,"I was looking for an aux cord to replace the 3foot one that I have my Bluetooth headphones (my job won't allow us to use Bluetooth with our devices, long story). I had the issue of accidentally unplugging the aux cord from my headphones while I was using them. Now, I don't have that issue anymore. The sound quality is exactly the same as I was previously getting with my other Aux cord. The quality of the cord itself seems like it will last pretty long because it has a sort of ""braided"" or ""weaved"" material on the outside of the wire for protection. I Would 100% recommend this product.",24999,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K3WX4FW

This is an absolute workhorse with a fairly rugged construction. I'm going to save you and refrain from detailing my coffee tastes, but you will not be disappointed. No coffee has disappointed from this machine, and it is a night-and-day difference from standard coffee makers in terms of taste and feel. It also doesn't destroy the coffee with the hot plate as quickly. You only have about 3 hours before taste suffers, but this is a bit better than traditional makers I have used. Be sure to take 5 minutes to look up the specific part number for the filters. They're huge, and Bunn sells ""large"" filters which actually aren't large enough. Buy it, it's great.",Bought this for work,"Working for the government......The powers that be decided after years and years (I'd say clear back to 1883 when our hospital was founded) of employees happily making coffee with the various coffee makers of mere mortals (like Mr. Coffee himself), that it was far too dangerous for licensed medical professionals to operate advanced home coffee-making machinery in the break room unless it was officially sanctioned by the safety committee, security, administration, and probably as a state institution, an act of legislature. Not that they had any intention of providing the officially sanctioned professional grade machines. So I purchased this miracle a month ago and once again, the patients on my floor are being cared for by professionals who have had their daily dose of fuel, available whenever they need it thanks to the double-warmer model Bunn I purchased. It brews fast enough for a nurse's break, which really in no break at all, delicious ambrosia of the gods!",Best coffee maker ever!,"I replaced three appliances on my counter with this Bunn. I have an electric kettle, coffee maker, and tea maker that have been retired. I did buy a different funnel for tea so it doesn't pick up the coffee taste. I use one carafe for coffee, the other (with the second funnel) for tea or hot water.The only gripe I have is that as the water in the storage area is kept hot, steam condenses on the water fill door on top of the unit. When you open it to add water and start the brewing process, the condensate drips on top of the unit through the hinge opening. I keep a paper towel near by to clean the drips.",Great Coffee Maker,Coffee maker arrived as promised and in good condition. The tape on the bottom of the outside carton had come off posing the potential for the device to fall out. The coffee maker was set up with no issues and is currently working well delivering several pots of coffee per day. One thing to watch for is when the unit is used with hard or heavily mineral water supplies. Deposits build up quite rapidly so the unit should be cleaned using the clean out spring quite often. I do like the longer clean out spring since it allows cleaning all the way into the reservoir.,Great coffee maker just like anticipated...just much louder than any coffee maker I've ever heard.,"Ok so I dislike when people give a product less than 5 stars and in their review, they tell you the item is perfect BUT they give some crazy reason for giving it less than 5 stars that has nothing to do with what they received. Like ""it's perfect but it came a day later than they said it would so 3 stars"". Or, ""the item is exactly as stated but it's too shiny...2 stars"", or ""there's nothing wrong with the product but my friend told me she saw one for 5 cents cheaper somewhere else so I'm deducting a star"". What?! Anyway, sorry for making you read that just to tell you the Bunn coffee maker works perfectly and brews tasty coffee...it's just REALLY loud. Crazy loud. If we're watching TV and it runs its heating cycle, we can no longer hear what's on TV. So 5 stars for it being exactly what it should be but we're probably going to replace it with something quieter and donate it to someone or some restaurant.",908,301,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0037XIP22

I end up buying new slippers every year because I am aways dissapointed by the poor quality of a promising purchase. However these slippers are pimp. I wear a 10.5 and on the recommendation of reviewers I bought a size 11-12. They couldnt fit better. Thank you Rock Dove for making my feet feel like millionares!,"Nice, comfy, & warm! Great slippers","Nice pair of step in slippers for around the house. I'm actually recovering from cancer right now, and use these every day in and around the house. Nice soft footbed that yes, the foam will eventually start to go flat, but I have been wearing mine literally every day for months now, and have no complaints. For the regular cost, they're awesome. I'd def buy again. Even if you get just one season out of these (you'll get more, I wear them for 6-12 hours a day, every day) it's worth it. Nice, soft, and comfy, yet still have a nice sole that is decent enough to take the trash out with. I dont see how these guys can ""feel every pebble"", what are they, Cinderella?! The foot bed is stiff, water proof rubber, I dont see how that's even possible...Edit: I noticed many of the bad reviews are all from around the later part of 2017. Maybe they had a bad run then? Maybe the guys complaining about the footbed weighed 400 lbs?! I dont know, but as stated, I've now had mine probably 4 or 5 months now, stitches are fine, footbed is just slightly ""squashed"" from when 1st purchased, and still wearing 'em everyday for hours at a time. I love em, and would most def buy again!",Great fit.,"I was hesitant to purchase these after a lot of the bad reviews. They arrived yesterday and I have worn them twice. They fit like a glove, which you want for slippers. My old pair, another brand, were too loose and slid around on my feet.I wear a 12 in tennis shoes so bought the 11-12 and the fit is spot on. Most slippers stretch out some too which will be fine. They are very soft and the memory foam is comfy. All memory foam eventually will smush down so I am prepared if that happens. I‚Äôm 240 lbs so I‚Äôm sure with all that weight pushing down will smush the foam.All in all they are good to go so far and just what I needed. I‚Äôll update my review if they fall apart later like others have reviewed.",I can see why that this is an Amazon Best Seller Item,"Instead of the usual flat cheap flip-flop slippers with flat plastic soles, I was on a quest for something better.I saw these Rockdove Men's Memory Foam Slippers listed as an Amazon Best Seller item. Thousands of people bought them and rated them above four stars. They're not kidding. These slippers are great!First off, they're Memory Foam and your feet immediately feel the difference once you wear them when new. The cushioning is better and softer than even expensive outdoor sneakers with air, gel, or Memory Foam inside. The entire bottom is made of Memory Foam, not just Foam for the toes, arch, or the heel, so you get full foot support. The thick layered comfort lasts for months.The top fabric is thick and strong; it wraps nicely around the feet, and adds a degree of warmth (especially in the winter) unrivaled by many other half-open slipper brands. The dark colors prevent stains and dirt from discoloring the fabric.The rubber soles have grooves although I wouldn't say they're for grip for hiking on trails. The soles work best on carpet and do not leave behind black scuff marks or deposit dirt. I don't wear these slippers outside; I only wear them indoors. Do note that wiping the black rubber soles will leave behind black color on the paper towel so I don't advise wearing these slippers on wet surfaces. But the soles can indeed be wiped clean on the occasion you do step outside.Eventually, the top fabric covering will lose its tightness and expand to the point that it's no longer warm and the Memory Foam will get flatter. These occurrences will probably happen before the rubber soles wear out so that's when it might be time to replace the slippers.One disadvantage of these slippers is that when walking on tile or hardwood flooring, they tend to clop like a horse trotting down a cobblestone street. This clopping noise can wake people up at night when going to the bathroom or kitchen. These aren't silent slippers on hard surfaces because the black soles are made of hard rubber. But inside a house with carpet, these Memory Foam Slippers are excellent for everyday use.","Super comfy, super affordable, ferret proof?","Was drawn to these because memory foam soles have made for some of the comfiest shoes I've found in the last few years, I liked the available colours and the price was good. Was not disappointed in the slightest! I used the size chart to pick the size and they fit great, they're super comfy for walking around my apartment. They do get a little warm, warmer than just wearing socks, but it took several hours before it got any degree of uncomfortable and popping them off for 10-15 minutes took care of that easily.I was intending to wear these barefoot and as a result I measured my feet barefoot and picked a size based on that, but as a result they are just a tiny bit too snug if I try to put them on with socks. This isn't an issue at all for me, I wasn't really planning to wear them with socks, but KEEP IN MIND TO MEASURE YOUR FEET WHILE WEARING SOCKS IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO WEAR THESE WITH SOCKS! Will save you the hassle of ending up with a pair that are just a bit too snug.Now, the reason I was looking for slippers in the first place was because I have two ferrets, one of whom will bite any socked feet he sees within seconds, so I've either had to go barefoot or put a pair of Crocs over my socks while in my bedroom to avoid getting my feet chomped on! This pair looked very thick and sturdy and seemed like they could stand up to the occasional chomp from a playful ferret. So far so good, but this is something that only time will tell how well they stand up to. We shall see!",104491,16,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU7N91J

Very good for minor cuts and scratches from the cats.It's the same formula as the others but roughly half the price. A few years ago, most vendors jacked up the price of triple antibiotic quite a bit. Did the ingredients go up that much? Apparently not for Good Sense, who kept their prices reasonable.",Fantastic Product,"You can't beat this product for the price! The cheapest I was able to find it at the grocery/pharmacy was $6-$7 so this is a great deal and most of us know by now that the generics are just as good as the brand names when it comes to OTC medications. Unlike supplements all OTC medicines are examined by the FDA for safety and effectiveness so as long as it has the same concentrations of active ingredients you're getting all of the efficacy without the extra cost. I also really appreciate the pain relief aspect, I was clipping my dog's paw fur when she decided to start doing the rhumba and I snipped the inside of my finger instead (Ouch!), after I applied this product and a band aid, my pain was reduced by about 60%.PROS: Cheap, Effective, Great at Reducing PainCONS: It needing to be shipped to your home just means you have to be sure to buy ahead of time before you need itTIP: Store this in your refrigerator and it makes a fantastic burn cream!*** Did you find this review helpful?

The scent is good enough...it‚Äôs not a damn baby wipe, so it does the job.I really don‚Äôt understand why people are complaining about these wipes...have these people been out there lately??

If you don‚Äôt like them then donate them to the delivery people who are working hard trying to get you your pristine wipes while trying to stay alive.",Kills germs everywhere,"I now use it everywhere around my house. Door knobs, mailboxes, toilet handles, keyboards, mouse, kitchen and bath counters. Great for removing stains and dirt of my walls too ! I even use it for dirsty mini blinds that are hard to clean. A must have for every home or office.If you found my review helpful to you, please vote below. Thank you for your time.",New Puppy Essential,"Stocked up on these wipes because having two puppies is a messy situation, to say the least. We've covered our Pergo floors with plastic and puppy pads - which has protected the laminate - but we still need to keep the floor and crates clean and fresh. It's so easy to just pop out a wipe and clean up! Not only do they have a good clean scent BUT they are also REALLY wet and pretty thick. Puppy messes can be nasty and I don't hesitate to pull out a wipe and pick up the mess - I've become an expert in wiping the area clean AND picking up the solids in one swoop (course, when they get bigger I wont' be able to do the one hand swipe).In short, if you have naughty doggies - keep a stock of these wipes nearby. Our house does not smell like doggie, simply because I keep the floors tidy with these. (BTW, there are other excellent uses for these - we use them to sanitize our kitchen counters, clean the outside of the toilet, clean our grandson's play table and highchair, and more!)",62521,4,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HSC9F2C

After some digging I found that this is a re-brand of a DIY board called the iGK61p. If you look around online you can find software made specifically for this keyboard pcb that allows you to control and program things such as lighting and macros.The keyboard looks and feels fantastic and seems very well built with little to no flex. The key caps it comes with are fine and show where all of the extra key functions are located but I swapped them out for an affordable pbt key cap set. It also has many interesting features that you won't find even on keyboards that cost double or more than this one. Features such as the fact that it's waterproof, uses optical switches, allows for swapping of switches to other optical switches, has a detachable usb C cable, full programmable RGB illumination, multiple RGB and macro profiles, and an on-board mic for a really cool lighting mode that follows sounds or music playing in the background. It uses Gateron blue optical switches that have a very unique feel to them. I have never tried regular Gateron switches so maybe this is how they all feel but compared to Cherry and Outemu blue switches they have a much quieter low-pitch click that is much more bearable and has smooth yet resistant key presses (the key press actuates fairly easily and without much force but feels different when bottoming out keys compared to cherry and outemu blue switches).Really my only criticism is that I really wish that the keyboard had a way to increase the incline a bit more because although it has a natural incline built into it, I'm just used to typing at a bit more of an incline than is possible with this keyboard.Overall this keyboard is really a steal at it's current price and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a good quality 60% mechanical keyboard.",Great value keyboard,"Great little keyboard for the money.I like the small form factor a lot, the build quality seems solid, and the blue key switches sound like signature blues, even though they aren‚Äôt Cherry brand.I already have 2 full size keyboards, one with browns and one with reds, so the blues are a nice change of pace. But I think I‚Äôll hotswap these switches for something less clackity down the line when I (or my girlfriend, or my next door neighbor) get sick of the machine gun sound it makes when I type e-mails.Anyways, the board is cool. RGB works, and has some interesting effects, but I only ever use the white background because I am not 13.","Best 60% board there is , hot swap switches, rgb , just amazing!","I have a Anne Pro 2 , but i bought this IG instago 60% keyboard because the hot swappable switches. The gateron switches feel great ! Same ones as some higher end keyboards like the anne pro 2 use, just great. Went with the blue myself. Love the rgb affects on this board and has a few options to choose from already on the keyboard , easy to do and very bright. Not dull or faded , vibrant colors. Just stunning ! My only 2 complaints i have are . 1 ] i couldn't get the software to download so i could do custom keys or custom rgb lights. Not a deal breaker , but i couldn't get it to download. 2] the keycaps themselves feel like cheap abs keycaps , but i already ordered new pbt double shot keycaps ( any cherry mx caps will fit no problem ) so even with the purchase of keycaps and the board itself. This was still much cheaper than the anne pro 2 or ducky one 2 mini. And in my opinion way better ! You must buy it , take a chance. You wont regret it. Im a hardcore gamer , i bought many keyboards from amazon and most were nothing impressive to say the least. But this one was amazing. Ill be ordering another to keep as a spare. And the hot swappable switches that will take any gaterons , make this a life long keyboard.Extremely pleased with my purchase.",Great value RGB 60% keyboard!,"Used this keyboard for typing and gaming.

The top feels very sturdy and is perfect for me since I'm in grad school and need space to spread my books, laptop, and notes out. I have a small studio apartment because I live in Washington, DC so being able to put the table up or move it easily (I don't have anyone to help me move furniture, so the lighter the better!) is crucial, and this one definitely fits that bill. It fits perfectly under my couch when I need more space, and I do like the clips for the legs under the table top so they're not flipping around while I'm putting it up. I'm not in love with the shape of the legs -- they're not quite the classic hairpin shape -- but I love the structure of the table top and it's *so* smooth so I can write on paper without having to have something underneath. I'll also note that there was a strong chemical smell when I first took it out of the box, but I think that was the packaging -- it doesn't smell at all now!","Easy to Assemble, Sturdy and Sleek!","I ordered this table from Sleekform after falling in love with their ergonomic kneeling chair. And I LOVE the table already! First off, as you can see from my photos, it doesn't really require an setup at all. Take the table out of the box and you're pretty much good to go. No screws, bolts, nuts, nails... It's basically shipped per-assembled. I was sick of working from the kitchen table. This new table gives me a fairly portable office. I can snap the legs back and pop up a desk anywhere. For example, the patio on a nice day as you can see from my photos. The wood quality appears to be strong. The legs feel very sturdy. It's lightweight when folded and can be carried around like a briefcase. Definitely recommend!",Looks like it's levitating!,"I was looking to replace a table in my bedroom and was intrigued by the price point and design of this desk. The wood and legs looked so stylish in the product photographs, and I am happy to report it looks even better than I expected it to look in my room from the pictures.Besides just being a good size to accommodate many of my projects and me, the wood is finished and a little thicker than some of the other desks I viewed. My favorite feature are the legs because they are so sleek! I like to play with light, and if around the legs is fairly dim, the table has the illusion that it's floating!I did move and install it by myself, but it'd be much easier to get out of the box with two people. The legs do fold up nicely should I ever want to store it and make space, though I don't plan to do that often. I would not recommend it for more rugged applications such as tailgating unless you plan to cover it in blankets while traveling, as the wood maybe would scratch. It's definitely sturdy enough for moving around and setting up in different parts of my house regularly.This is also the kind of furniture that would look really impressive if I ever saw it in an Airbnb. Can't really say why! Kind of feels like California with the light wood finish. If I ever rent my place as an Airbnb, this thing is going in the entryway with all of the snacks! For around $100, I'm amazed by the premium look and feel of this desk. Just remember to keep it that way, do as the packaging says and ""for goodness sake, use a coaster!""This is the second piece I've bought from Sleekform, my first being a kneeling chair ""the Austin"". All and all, my experience with their products as been A+. They care a lot about what they make and will make things right if you're not satisfied.That being said, I think you will be -- Go for it!",Perfect size and easy to set up.,"I bought this desk now that we are working from home due to covid-19. I have a small apartment and didn't want a ""real"" desk that would be bulky and I couldn't put away when I return to the office. I also didn't want something that would be an eyesore. This looks really nice and fits well with my decor. This is the perfect size to fit my laptop, monitor and enough space for a notebook and a few other items. It is real wood and seems well made. I also like that it came already assembled so all I had to do was pop the legs up and it was ready. My only feedback is that I would like if there was a mechanism to lock the legs in to place more tightly. There are little rubbers that keep it from skidding around on my hardwood floors but it still feels a little wobbly. It's not bad though. I am conisdering buying a second one to make a larger table that I could use for dining with frineds as well",Love this desk,With our new working from home/school situation we have had to continually shift where we are working out of. This desk was perfect for that. The top is beautiful wood and very sturdy. The legs fold in to allow us to tuck it in the closet when we have visitors. The bottom of each leg has a grip wrapped around it to keep it from sliding on our hardwoods. Great quality and perfect for our lifestyle.,795,166,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0778SXJDL

It matches exactly this Ashley bedroom suite I bought a couple years ago, like right down to the exact same knobs, so I have to wonder if it's the same manufacturer, like Prepac and Ashley are the same. It's sturdy and made well. Also, all the parts were there, none of them damaged or scratched in any way, which, for anyone who's bought box furniture before, seems to be a tremendous ask as it seems like there's always something missing, something damaged, or something not right, like holes not lining up or some piece that was cut too short or crooked or something. Not the case here. Everything was exactly as it should be.Second, in as much as it took me three hours to assemble, keep in mind that I'm a 50-year-old sedentary fat guy who decided to do it on his own. A second pair of hands would've made it go easily more than twice as fast. Also, even though it took that long, the instructions were crystal clear and easy to follow, something else that also seems to be a big ask for box furniture makers as instructions are all too often as clear as mud, which all too often is the result of them being written in broken English by someone who obviously doesn't speak English as a first language or even speak it very well as a second or third language. So, YAY FOR GREAT INSTRUCTIONS! Because they are written with brevity and clarity in mind such that, with the accompanying illustrations, the only way you can go wrong is if you fail to actually read the instructions or really look at the pictures.Now, that isn't to say that I didn't make a couple of flub ups, but both of those were the result of me not paying attention or assuming something, one being that I put a shelf on backwards because I, for whatever reason, got it into my head that I was looking at what would be the backside, thus putting the finished edge to the back instead of the front, but that was my own fault because the picture actually showed the finished edge should've been facing me and was easily corrected a couple minutes later, which only took me a few minutes, and the other being that I put a side on upside down, which was also the result of me not paying attention because one edge has three bored holes and the opposite doesn't, and the instructions clearly showed them facing up, not down, which I got right on the first side but got sloppy doing the second and didn't notice that I'd put it on upside down, a mistake that set me back five or 10 minutes and was entirely my own fault.You'll notice that I gave it four stars for stability instead of five. It's not because it's not sturdy but because it's so tall, but I wanted it that tall, and while it's quite heavy, the bottom of course isn't really heavier than the top, meaning it's kind of tippy on my thickly padded carpet. A hack of course, is to put plenty of heavy things in the bottom and not very much heavy stuff at the top, but who wants to do that? So it really needs to be secured to the wall, especially if you ever expect children to be around it.The good news is that it comes with a tether to attach it to the wall. The bad news is the tether sucks. It's essentially a heavy-duty drywall anchor screw that hooks to an anchor you put on the back of the shelf by way of a zip tie, which I'm sure would work, but, one, using it means that you can't have the shelf flush against the wall because its hardware behind the shelf sticks out about an inch and, two, the zip tie, even in the illustrated instructions, shows it doesn't keep the shelf from tipping forward but just keeps it from tipping over, so if it were to tip, like from a child pulling on it or something, it'll tip forward four or five inches before the zip tie catches, meaning everything on it is likely going to end up on the floor, or worse, on that child. The point of the anchor shouldn't be just to save the shelf but to also save everything on the shelf and save anyone, most especially a child, who will be bombarded by all the stuff on the shelf should it tip forward those four or five inches before the zip tie catches it. So what I did is bought a small metal L-bracket from Loewe's for a $1.50 and attached it the top of the shelf with the screw for the included anchor as I knew that screw was short enough that it wouldn't come out the other side as the bottom side of that shelf is visible, it being 70 or so inches in the air, and then I used that the heavy-duty drywall anchor that came included to attach it to the wall, so it's flush and completely immobile, cannot tip at all.The only other criticism I have is that the shelf labeled B5, the center shelf in the top section that is non-adjustable because being fixed in place with cams is part of what makes the entire structure sound and sturdy, isn't white on the bottom. All of the adjustable shelves are white on both sides, but that shelf isn't. Now, that's not a problem for the B5 shelf that goes in the bottom since it's behind a piece of facia and only a couple inches off the ground and thus not visible to anyone except maybe a dormouse, but the B5 shelf that is in the top section is four or five feet off the ground, so when you're sitting in a chair or in bed or whatever, you can see the bottom of the shelf isn't white but is unfinished particle board, unlike the shelf above it and below it. Since I'm going to be repainting a couple of doors white, when I do, I'm just going to paint the underside of that shelf white, but that's not something I should have to do. The underside of that shelf should come white because it's high enough off the ground that unless you put it in a place where everyone's always over four-foot tall and always standing, never sitting down or lying down, which, let's face it, is extremely unlikely in any home situation, what with homes being where people like to take a load off and spend much time sitting down or lying down, people are going to see that it's unfinished and doesn't match the shelf above it and the shelf below it.Overall, though, I'm extremely pleased. EXTREMLEY. Getting flat-box furniture for assembly is a huge risk for me that I'm always extremely reluctant to about since, more times than not, it ends up being a complete nightmare to put together because of unclear instructions, missing parts, damaged parts, and/or incorrectly manufactured parts. THAT IS NOT THE CASE HERE.The manufacturer clearly has some good quality control going on and has made sure the instructions are brief, clear, and easy to follow. So, if you do it one step at a time, reading each of the 22 steps' very brief, clear, and easy-to-follow instructions in conjunction with doing what it shows in its accompanying illustration before starting that step and comparing what you see with the illustration during carrying out that step, you won't go wrong and you will end up with a solid, sturdy, quality piece of furniture. You do have to know how to follow simple instructions, though, something not everyone's good at, i.e., not be one of those people who steams ahead and then only refers to the instructions after it goes wrong. The instructions are simple and clear. You just have to use them and follow them, and if you're doing it by yourself, set aside a good couple of hours when you can focus on doing so undisturbed. And to be clear, it taking a while to put together didn't mean it was hard to put together. It was all very simple. It just had a lot of simple steps.P.S. The instructions say you only need a hammer, a Philips-head screwdriver, and a flathead screwdriver for assembly, which is true. It also suggests that if you have a power drill with a Philips-head bit, assembly will go much more quickly. I'd go so far to say that that should be more than a suggestion. It's a necessity. I wouldn't t attempt to assemble this without a power drill for turning all the screws because some of them are quite hard to turn by hand and are tall enough that trying to do it by hand would be unwieldy and could result in you scratching the shelf or gouging your hand or just getting frustrated by having to try and press hard and turn hard on rather tall screws, so if you don't have a power drill with a Phillips-head screwdriver attachment, borrow one for putting this together. Also, make sure that your Phillips screwdriver head is a good one and not worn, not one that's been previously stripped or damaged, which seems like is the case more times than not. You can sometimes get by with a damaged Philips head when it's only light screwing that needs to be done, but this isn't one of those times because this is more like medium-level screwing, screwing that requires enough torque that, unless your Philips head is good, it'll fail at getting the job done, and if you go ahead and try anyway, you'll more than likely just strip out the screw heads such that when you're forced to finally give up and go get a good Philips-head, it won't work either.Long story short: Have a power drill with a good (not worn or stripped) Philips-head screwdriver attachment to use for putting this together, because if you don't, if you try and get by with a non-power screwdriver and/or one whose head is worn or stripped, you will NOT be a happy camper.Anyway, great shelf. Very, very happy.",Looks great; parts could be better labeled (or labeled!),"Put in a bedroom where a closet was supposed to be, but the niche was too shallow. Thought of adding carpentry shelves, but saw this option and the width was near perfect and the height is great. We had a small brown bookshelf for about a year as a space holder. When we finally decided to make the purchase, the product all but disappeared. Could have gotten it a bit cheaper, but we thought it was discontinued and had to purchase when we found it. A few weeks later, we found it cheaper, even here at Amazon, but it was too late to do anything about it. Overall, happy with the purchase, it looks great. I didn't unpackage or put it together, but was told the pieces were not labelled; that would have made the putting together easier. Also, one of the nails that keeps the back on went through to the front and marred the shelf above the doors at the rear, but that was the fault of the assembler. Word to the wise; be careful where you place the nails.",Good little bookcase,Good bookshelf. My husband put it together. He is not a fan of assemble-it-yourself furniture but he said it wasn‚Äôt bad. It is heavy.,Beautiful,"Looks beautiful, just as pictured. This took my husband a few hours to put together once he figured out which piece was which, but it was worth it.",Highly recommend,This bookshelf is sturdy and looks great!

Additionally the braiding itself feels kind of nice, like a kind of durable polymer instead of a standard fabric.

That one broke within the first 5 minutes of use. But then again it only cost me .99¬¢, so it's what I should have expected. Because I still needed to get price tags on the consignment sale items I was in the process of tagging I decided to spend the $10 to order this one in hopes that it would work better than the .99¬¢ model I had previously ordered from ebay that took 3 weeks to get here from China. Needless to say I was not disappointed with my purchase of this Tagging Gun and was able to tag all 360 garments of my clothing tagged in no time. Not only did it work better it came with plenty of tags and extra needles. It arrived very quickly since I purchased it with free 2 day shipping using my Prime. I tagged all of my items for the consignment sale using the same needle that came installed in the protective cap. I still haven't had to replace it and look forward to using it in the next consignment sale in the spring. The tags are easy to load and the needle is sharp enough to go through even the thickest of clothes. I even used it to tag some leather shoes and it went right through the leather straps with no problem.Overall, I highly recommend it for tagging consignment sale, garage sale items. It was a major time saver in my efforts to get my tagging done.I paid full price for this item and this review is based on my use of the item.",Inexpensive and works great!,"I've been selling my children's clothes at consignment sales for years now and have always priced the clothes using safety pins. I finally decided it was time to get a tagging gun and make my life easier. This gun sure did!It was one of the less expensive guns that are out on the market, but I thought I would give it a shot. I am so pleased with this tagging gun! The instructions were very clear on how to load the tags into the machine and how to insert and remove the needle.The only instructions that were not very clear was how to properly get the tag to go into the clothes. The instructions explained how to insert the needle into the clothes and pull the trigger but I kept having misfires. The tag would shoot out, but wouldn't go through the clothes. Having never used a tagging gun before, I didn't realize that you have to push the needle ALL the way through the tag and the clothes so it is flush and tight up against the base of the gun. The tag needs to be flush against the base. Once I figured that out, it's a breeze to use! Definitely recommend this product.",AWESOME,Love this thing! Glad it come with refill needles and additional tag attachments. Not sure if people realize when you‚Äôre retagging items you‚Äôre not supposed to put it through the fabric. I guess working in retail has taught me this. But it is supposed to go through the seams or the size tag because it will leave a small hole. ALL taggers will leave a hole if punched through the fabric. This one is great quality and punches through thick material.,6268,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PWQILU8

Great product and my main source of erasing with great precision.,"An excellent eraser for very small areas, understand it has a specific purpose","This is kind of a really excellent for what it is. It is a very small precision razor. It‚Äôs 2 mm wide so you‚Äôre not gonna get any smaller than that considering that we‚Äôre talking about rubber. The pin is made in Japan and erasers are made in Korea. I have many erasers of many types, I miss it will give me the most precise erasure area without damaging the paper with any of them.Remember this is a precision eraser so it‚Äôs mostly going to be made for highlights and very small mistakes. You‚Äôre not going to use it on your math homework and you‚Äôre not gonna expect it to completely erase several layers of pigment. You would probably want a white pencil or a highlight pen for that. So many of the complaints I‚Äôve read on the negative reviews are expecting unrealistic performance out of this thing. And precision eraser has very specific purposes. And yes it‚Äôs probably for artists and draftsman and not for much else. Maybe people who write really really tiny. They make bigger pins with the same razor material if you need to raise a larger area. And if you need to clean out bigger areas of pigment, there are other types as well.I think I paid four dollars for this thing and I ran a complaint about price to performance ratio. It comes with three refills and it does it‚Äôs job perfectly and it‚Äôs four dollars so I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôre expecting as far as price to performance. Again I think the negative reviews come from people with unrealistic expectations of what an eraser the small will do. 2 mm to give you an idea of how small that is it‚Äôs about half the diameter of the tiny eraser that would come on a mechanical pencil.I think I paid four dollars for this thing and I read a complaint about price to performance ratio.

Again I think the negative reviews come from people with unrealistic expectations of what an eraser this small will do. It‚Äôs 2 mm so to give you an idea of how small that is it‚Äôs about half the diameter of the tiny eraser that would come on a mechanical pencil.Someone compared this unfavorably to the FC dust-free eraser. well I‚Äôve got news for you, this is the exact same material. But that one is a huge honking block of the same vinyl so of course it‚Äôs going to work better on a gigantic area because the things 100 times as large. But you won‚Äôt use that one to do a highlight on lips or an iris.I hope this eases some peoples concerns about the negative reviews. This thing is awesome. It is a little bit smaller than the small electric erasers. Those are very handy too and I own several but these give you more control. If you need something smaller you‚Äôre probably going to need to draw in the highlight rather than to erase to one.This is pretty much been the best eraser I‚Äôve owned for doing highlights.",Must have for art,This is my second time buying this eraser. It has easily became a must have art supply for me! It allows me to erase small details and make crisp lines. I like these more than kneaded erasers as you can apply more pressure without the eraser changing shape.,"The very BEST ERASERS for adult coloring!!!! I've bought dozens to give to friends, they are THAT good!!!","I've bought dozens of these to give to people doing Adult Coloring. This is the best eraser for getting into the small areas. The bigger erasers end up erasing stuff you don't want erased and then you have to go back and fix it!!! These erasers are the best you can buy and the Value Pack (4 pencil erasers with 2 extra refill erasers for each pencil eraser) all which last a long long time since you are erasing only what needs erasing, is by far the best way to go. They also sell just the refills, so they've got all covered. Now if the would manufacture their Sand Erasers in the pencil format it would be a better world!!! You know they are good when someone buys lots of them to give to friends because she thinks they should have one!!!!","Once you go Tombow, you'll never want to use anyone else!","This is the best eraser I had ever used. As a comic book advocate, amateur and enthusiast I use a lot of various techniques to create my own comic series and do a lot of fan-art within tiny sketchbooks. This is the only eraser that can actually tackle the task of removing those slight tiny mistakes that make a huge difference in how a piece looks and ends up looking as. It even removes dark pencil marks, which impress me the most. Most other erasers either break apart, has a lot of left-over residue or doesn't remove enough of the mark to make it clear. This removes pencil marks wile not snugging ink work on the finished product. This even removed color pencil marks, though I used Crayolas' color pencils. I would love to some day try out Tombow color pencils. Anyways I highly recommend this for sketchbooks and small art projects.",8289,757,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O98USLU

Two are lightweight, have matching patterns on the handles, cheap, and come from different sellers. The brushes are too narrow, so you have to sweep more. The construction of both is flimsy, and the handles of both have fallen off. They both tip over easy due to the light weight, which spills the dustpan contents back on to the floor. The other two are from O Cedar. One is the first set we bought after realizing the mini hand brooms and dustpans are worthless. I thought it was great, so we got another. Unfortunately, they weren‚Äôt the same model and the second one is so heavy no one uses it.This set is nearly perfect. It is sturdy but not too heavy. The height works for everyone in our house, from the 5 foot tall kid to the 6‚Äô2‚Äù adult. The comb that allows you to clean off pet fur or hair from the broom is spaced to match the broom and seems sturdy. It folds up, while 2 of our others flip open when picked up. But it also flips open easily, while we have to step on the dustpan and yank to open.The only change I would appreciate would be to shave a few more ounces from the broom without compromising its height or sturdiness, although it‚Äôs fine as is.",A 'designer' broom and dustpan,"I bought this broom to use in the hallway (carpeted) in order to pick up those small pieces of paper left behind by my middle school students. It is lightweight and very sturdy. You can leave the dustpan to stand up on hits own. The comb, on the end of the dustpan, is wonderful. I don't have to bend over or even touch the broom if something gets stuck on the end. It folds up flat and you can store it in a very narrow spot (so it is out of sight).

The weight required for sitting comfortably on the amount of tension held by the bungees is at least teenager+ in age.

The seat part is not very deep so it seems at first that you feel the bungees on your butt while sitting, but a simple folded blanket provides a little extra softness. It is sturdy and it seems like it will last, however I don't think that I would have paid $47 in person for this chair, but it's cool.",Very comfortable,"Great for the beach, pool or anywhere.

Not a problem for my 6 and 10 year old. They enjoyed playing store with it once or twice a week for a few weeks before it went in rotation with their other toys. The credit card ""swiper"" barely has any resistance to it, nor any length, so it's not satisfying if you're into swiping cards. The paper pad doesn't stick there. Better off using a post-it pad, plus you can stick them on items like they're price tags. The included bills and coins are good toy quality, but like others have said, you have 4 types of bills, but only 3 sections for bills in the register. I understand this decision-- you can't have good sized bills and an affordable sized register that fits in your toybox. It's just unfortunate. Maybe smaller bills would've been better. Coins are distinguishable. I'd give this a 4.3 out of 5.0.",Great Quality,"Bought for my 4 year old daughter so she could start recognizing real money, being a math teacher I hated her playing with the make believe stuff that didn‚Äôt look real. It fits real money great and the money it comes with looks so realistic. Learning Resources toys have been great to holding up to the beating a child can give so even though this was more expensive then other registers I was looking at I knew it was worth it.

One 4-year-old wouldn‚Äôt let it out of her grasp and wanted to take it to BED with her!!! Since counting money is now taught in first grade, it‚Äôs a great head start for this age and can be used (along with the REAL built-in calculator) for at least until age 7-8. It is well built, very sturdy, has a note pad and pretend credit card, and has a wonderful *ding* sound when the register is opened! And the price hasn‚Äôt really changed in 10 years!

I also have the milk frother... I usually make a capsule, and froth some milk and italian sweet cream flavored creamer and viola! As good as a $5 latte at the fancy local coffee shop for 1/4 the price. I REALLY can't complain about the cost of these babies when I would happily pay nearly $3 for a McDonald's latte which isn't nearly as good.I think my favorite flavors thus far are Cappricio, Roma, and Arpeggio","Good Representation, Decide What's Right for You","I just bought my Nespresso Inissia online, and I wanted to make sure I had some capsules ready for when my Inissia arrived. This review is intended for new owners that are looking for a variety of Nespresso capsules. At the time of this posting, I've had my Inissia for 36 hours.I went with five stars to offset a lot of the older posts that attack the other listings based on value. Yes, you can most likely getmore bang from your buck if you make a large purchase from the Nespresso site, but sometimes that's not the best choice for the individual. I want this review to give you a breakdown of the flavors you get, and let you judge if it is the right purchase for you.First off, I wanted to point out that the Inissia comes bundled with a variety pack of 14 capsules. It's a pretty good variety from their various offerings. There is one vanilla, one decaf, and the other 12 cover a range of their Grand Cru capsules. Intenso, Espresso, Pure Origin, Lungo, Decaffeinato, and Variations (flavored) are all represented. Honestly, if I had to do it over again, I would have sampled the various offerings, and then made a large purchase directly from Nespresso. However, I know that may not be the right option for everyone, so read on if you want a breakdown of the five flavors representedThe five capsules offered in this five pack are listed below. Descriptions are taken from the Nespresso site:CAPRICCIO (from the Espresso line)Intensity: 5RICH AND DISTINCTIVE:Blending South American Arabicas with a touch of Robusta, Capriccio is an espresso with a rich aroma and a strong typical cereal note.OriginThe presence of South American Arabicas grown at high altitude gives this blend a light acidity, which is balanced with the perfect amount of Brazilian Arabica and a touch of Robusta.RoastingThe light roasting of this blend creates a rich character and preserves a light acidity.Aromatic ProfileA typical cereal note balanced with a light acidity.ARPEGGIO (from the Intenso line)Intensity: 9INTENSE AND CREAMY:A dark roast of pure South and Central American Arabicas,Arpeggio has a strong character and intense body, enhanced by cocoa notes.OriginA selection of the best South and Central American Arabicas, with fruity or malted profiles, characteristic of Costa Rican coffees.RoastingArpeggio is roasted intensely to bring out the characteristics of each origin. Its full body develops from the fine grinding of the beans.Aromatic ProfileIntense, grilled notes alongside subtle cocoa notes and woody hints.LIVANTO (from the Espresso line)Intensity: 6ROUND AND BALANCED:A blend of pure Arabica from South and Central America,Livanto is a well-balanced espresso characterized by a roasted caramelized note.OriginThis blend is composed of the most prestigious Central and South American Arabicas, found in Costa Rica and Colombia and is cultivated according to traditional methods to preserve their malted and fruity profiles.RoastingA medium roasting, accentuates malted notes, whilst fruity notes evolve to create a complex and delicate caramelized bouquet.Aromatic ProfileA round and balanced profile, typical of freshly roasted coffee results in a combination of cereal, malted and caramelized notes as well as fine fruity notes.ROMA (from the Intenso line)Intensity: 8FULL AND BALANCED:The balance of lightly roasted South and Central American Arabicas with Robusta, gives Roma sweet and woody notes and a full, lasting taste on the palate.OriginCultivated at high altitude, the Central American Arabicas bring finesse, whilst the Brazilian Arabicas and Robustas provide body and a lingering taste on the palate.RoastingLight roasting and fine grinding bring finesse to the blend and create a short espresso, which is not too strong.Aromatic ProfileRoasted and woody notes are revealed through the light roasting of intensely flavoured beans from different origins.RISTRETTO (from the Intenso line)Intensity: 10POWERFUL AND CONTRASTING:A blend of South American and East African Arabicas, with a touch of Robusta, roasted separately to create the subtle fruity note of this full-bodied, intense espresso.OriginComposed of some of the best South American Arabicas from sources such as Colombia and Brazil, Ristretto also contains the great, lightly acidic East African Arabicas and a touch of Robusta for added zing.RoastingThe beans are roasted slowly and separately to obtain an original bouquet bringing together acidic, fruity, and roasted notes. Its finely ground texture creates an Italian-style coffee: intense, with a rich flavour and full body.Aromatic ProfileStrong roasted notes softened by notes of chocolate. A subtle contrast between strength and bitterness, acidic and fruity notes.ConclusionThis is a pretty good variety pack if you want a fairly standard selection. You're not going to get outliers like Lungo, Decaffeinato, Variations, or the Pure Origin series. If you want to buy in bulk, then buying here may not be the most cost effective option. However, if you want to try five different Espressos that are all good and fairly standard, this is a pretty good representation if the math works out. By all means, shop around and find the best bargain, but this is a good representation.","If you want THE best taste from your Nespresso machine, these are a MUST!!!","Can't believe the difference in taste between these OEM capsules & 3rd party capsules. As many other reviewers have noted, the 3rd party capsules (and I've tried 5 different 3rd party brands now) are weak in taste & flavor. I have the DeLonghi Lattissima Pro machine & with an OEM Nespresso ristretto capsule, the latte & cappuccino are just magnificent. With the 3rd party capsules, they're both mediocre...at best.PROS: The best flavors & taste. Wide choice of coffee types.CONS: VERY expensive compared to other types/brands of capsules or pods.",Barista Master in Press of Button,"Nespresso hit one outta the park. This variety pack provides a solid offering to put your taste buds in the espresso zone.Ok, some people have crushed unit issues...I have never had 1 issue.Even if I did, the product is to good to let a shipper pull down a superior product.I am not a drip coffee drone guy, I want top quality taste and fantastic aroma which is delivered.

Easy to clean as well.",Terrific Coffee Maker! Made In America! Minimal Plastic Path! And RTFM,"Greetings,I‚Äôm a longtime engineer and coffee drinker - and coffee makers are kind of my passion. I‚Äôm also a ‚Äúmade in America‚Äù kind of guy (when I can) and I‚Äôm also concerned about the problems with drinking through plastic, which leeches nasty stuff. I have used press pots (lovely but stupid hard to clean), espresso machines (awesome but lots of work for one cup), and my most recent affair with a Chemex (made in America, zero plastic in the path, great coffee). But the Chemex drove my wife crazy as it was 20 minutes of ‚Äúart‚Äù to get a cup, which was cold very quickly after...So I began the search with the above criteria, and found this Bunn Speed Brew Elite - hmmm, looks cool on my counter, Made in America, great reviews, and if you are paying attention (I did) the only plastic in the coffee path is the spray head and the filter box, both made of commercial, food-grade silicon, which is the least leechy plastic you can get. So it checks all my boxes.HOWEVER this coffee maker ain‚Äôt like the other girls - it requires some up-front research, plus a thorough reading of the manual (I did it twice!) before you use it. (BTW engineers know what RTFM stands for ;-) ). I relish trying new ways of doing things, and that‚Äôs an important element of this Bunn.*** Tip 1 *** Run at least THREE pots of fresh water through it before you make any coffee, to get the ‚ÄúZen‚Äù of it - once you do, it‚Äôs easy. Plus it makes for no smells or weirdness going forward (heck, you should do this with any coffee maker you get)*** Tip 2 *** Think of the ‚ÄúOn Switch‚Äù as when you CLOSE THE LID AFTER YOU HAVE POURED THE WATER IN - the heated pot is already full of water, so you are technically pouring in ‚Äúthe next pot‚Äù to start the current one.*** Tip 3 *** Use Bunn Filters!!! If you use other filters without practice, you are just asking for a big mess - Bunn filters are TALLER than regular. Just Do It.Get it right (coarser grind, but more coffee - and this Bunn does use more coffee due to the fast head) and this makes a heck of a pot of coffee in record time, no kidding! It is literally so fast you have no need of a timer. Once I wrapped my head around that, I realized timers are kind of a kluge. Bunn Speed is The Way!BTW I ponied up a bit more for this Silver model - it just looks cooler on my counter, and helps to hypnotize coffee guests... It‚Äôs kind of a Unicorn - guests can‚Äôt take their eyes off of it - then they taste it, and can‚Äôt stop asking questions!Finally, it‚Äôs THE last drip coffee maker that‚Äôs still made in the Good Old US of A. Can‚Äôt beat that with a stick - another reason to support them!So take time to prepare to use this, and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Highly Recommended.",Makes a pot of Coffee in 4 minutes,"The only issue I had was in understanding the set up. The first time you use it, fill it with 2 full carafes of water. This water will all go into the reservoir. After the 15 minutes it takes the water to heat up, you THEN put the Coffee grounds into the filter and then add a THIRD carafe of water and close the lid. Your Coffee will be ready in 4 minutes (for a full carafe). The reservoir Supplies the hot water to brew the Coffee immediately. The third carafe replaces the hot water taken from the reservoir for your current brew. This will heat up and be ready for the next carafe. The Coffee maker is meant to Stay on 24/7. Otherwise you must turn it on and wait 15 minutes for the reservoir to heat up. Once it heat up add the grounds, add thewater and in 4 minutes it is ready. Makes good Coffee! I don't like it strong so with the circular shower head soaking all the grounds I Find using only 4 scoops of grounds for a full pot is perfect.",Probably the smoothest cup of coffee I've had at home,"This is the first coffee maker I've had in a very long time that I could actually drink the coffee it makes black and not gag on it from being too bitter, that alone is worth a lot to me, the due fact that it makes a full pot in 4 minutes just sweetens the deal.",Excellent tradition of great coffee makers!,This unit carries on the tradition of excellent coffee makers by Bunn. This is the same tried and true design that Bunn has used for years and for good reason. No need to mess with a great product. I liked the look of the stainless cylinder design but I decided to save the $50. Same great flavor derived from the proper water temp. I‚Äôve seen reviews where the claim was the water wasn‚Äôt reaching the optimal temp and that may be true but the coffee still brews and steeps thoroughly enough to extract the proper flavor. At least that‚Äôs my experience. Great buy for $99!!,425,89,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0792T7RW1

Hold big frames and clip boards alike.,Absolutely Fantastic Wire Hooks for Beautifying your Cubicle,"I purchased a box of these panel wall wire hooks almost three years ago, and have gotten so much use out of them! They are very thin, sharp, and quite long, so I had no problems hanging quite sizable piece of art that had been matted and framed off the walls of my old cube. I sometimes doubled-up on them if I was hanging a particularly heavy piece, but after many years of use, I never had a single one break, bend, or send my art tumbling to the ground.I used these hooks to hang art, Christmas lights, Halloween decorations, dreamcatchers, and all sorts of things to help surround myself with things I enjoyed while at work. One of my favorite features was the fact that the curved outer piece is long and thing enough to fit into most framed artwork, and by virtue of having two supports in the back, it was actually quite easy to support items without risking having the mounting bend of falter.I really enjoyed using these hooks and would definitely recommend them if you're interested in decorating your cube, and while I'm content to no longer have cubicle walls any longer, I still have them safely stowed away in case the need arises again... :)I am a longtime Amazon Prime customer who enjoys writing reviews in my free time.

It's been a year and nothing as fallen so far.

It says they clip between the panel and the hook but they just don't bend to be tight enough. That is another thing, they are very very strong! you just have to make sure you pinch the top and then put them in the panel. Also I would not recommend hanging heaving things if your panels are very loose material. We have tight fabric over metal panels so its a firm hold.Anyway, the paper-holding problem was fixed!

I purchased the Rubbermaid to replace another brand that failed while I was standing on it. Most reviewers say this is a very nice foot stool. I agree.Some reviewers negatively commented on the latch being loose. See attached photo 2. I put on my engineering hat and decided this is by design and is a safety feature. When the stool is in use the latch hangs loose about 1/8 inch away from the cross bar. If for whatever reason the foot stool will start to fold while you are standing it the latch will engage the cross bar and prevent it from folding. The weight on the top step is supported by the cross bar.The failed stool that I replaced had a latch that looked similar and was tight, but the integrity of the stool depended entirely on the latch. Unknown to me the latch had become misaligned and the stool collapsed while I was standing on it. A couple of curse words and the trash can took care of this one.A nice feature of the Rubbermaid is the height of the ‚Äúhandle‚Äù which could aid in keeping your balance if the stool is not in front of a wall or cabinet. An example is changing a light bulb in the middle of a roomThis Rubbermaid step stool appears to be constructed decently and should last a reasonable amount of time. Keep in mind like any other foot stool for household use it is just that. If you need something for daily heavy duty use then buy a quality ladder.",A Stool for a Lady,"This is a perfect little stepstool! We have the black three-step one, but it keeps getting commandeered for the dirty ""project"" parts of the house and is never there when I need to reach something in the kitchen. I thought I'd try the two-step in the hopes that it was a little easier to maneuver, and sure enough it is. It is not light like the aluminum ones, but the flimsiness of those scares me. I'd rather have a little more weight but feel more secure when standing on it, and it's easy enough to swing over to where I need it and pop the steps out. There's an easy latch you push down on to release the steps so that they don't come popping out at inopportune times, as well. It sounds weird, but every time I use this I feel happy. The white and grey is so pretty, and the whole thing is just well designed!","Although heavier than expected, it's sturdy and well built","I was going back and forth about getting either a 2-step or 3-step stool. My townhouse has several recessed lights that I need to reach. At only 5'1"", the 3-step was a good choice! Step stool arrived today. The packaging had extra tape but the box itself was secure and no damage. Whew! The step-stool came wrapped so no scuffs/scratches. The step stool is a bit heavier than expected. When I ordered, I didn't read that it's 14 pounds. But 14 pounds isn't too bad considering this step stool is a mix of steel and plastic.It's sturdy on carpet and hardwood. No issues with wobbling. I like that the handle is tall enough to hold while standing at the top. I also like the safety latch to prevent the step stool from closing on itself. This won't be my daily step stool. I've got one of those single step ones for daily tasks. This 3-step is going to be great for getting me high enough to change my lights as well as adjust things in the basement.Label on the top step was easy to peel off as it only had the 4 corners tacked down with that double-sided tacky stuff. There are warning/safety stickers under the bottom step. Overall, very pleased with the quality of the step stool. I'll come back to update if anything changes!",Sturdy and Easy to Use!,"I like how this Step Stool opens and closes, no worries about finger pinching! When folded it takes up very little space. The steps feel sturdy and I really like how there is a closable compartment to hold tiny nails or screws (w/ red cover). There are slots in the top tray to hold screw drivers, pliers, and a hammer along with a space for a paint can ( or a light bulb so it doesn't roll off!) I wish I had this years ago!",Make no debate... It‚Äôs beyond great!,"I found myself on the hunt for a 6 ft. ladder. I drive a very small (mini) car.

It took another $70 to make this keyboard what I actually found to be useable. That's not a bad thing, I do think that those new to the hobby will love this keyboard and tinkering with new switches/keycaps to make it your own.The quality is decent, it's nothing special, though it does not feel overly cheap for it's price. I'd say it's what is expected quality-wise. The software is hard to use at first, then becomes pretty easy to navigate. The website you need to go to in order to download the software is sketchy, the forums are filled with adult content, but thankfully all you need to do is go download the software and that goes off without any hiccups.In all, this is a great budget friendly, starter keyboard for anyone new or even a veteran of mechanical keyboards alike.",Fantastic Keyboard - Even Better for Enthusiasts,"This keyboard has been awesome.Switches - Great quality Gateron Black Switches are what I went with. I have had a hell of a time finding a board with black switches anymore. When I could find them, they were often optical switches, and I wanted mechanical switches. They are indeed, hot swappable as well. The switches pull out easily, and you can try Cherry, Kailh, or Gateron switches. Great if you want to try out different switches.Keycaps - The keyboard has great feeling PBT keycaps. Once I tried PBT keycaps, I could never go back to ABS plastic keycaps. They feel great, and the legends (lettering) on the keys are nice and simple. Too many keyboards have dumb, edgy looking legends trying to look cool. These are simple and good looking.Lighting - The lighting is not great. The light isn't very bright, so it doesn't shine through the black keycaps well. I didn't really care about the lighting. I just want a little light, so I can read the keycaps if it's dark. It has several lighting modes you can swap through without software. Typical responsive, breathing, snake, etc.I didn't try the wireless mode, but that is included. It also has the braided, detachable USB-C power cord. That is awesome. The board feels very solid. It is largely plastic construction, but it doesn't feel like it. It feels like it could take a beating- definitely no flex. Another bonus I didn't even notice until it arrived- it comes with a keycap and switch puller. Not the garbage plastic keycap puller, but the better two metal arms that squeeze around the keycap. Everyone should be buying these kinds of keyboards, not the typical big companies'.TL, DR: I spent many hours looking for a good enthusiast starter keyboard. This is better than I even hoped for. Amazing value.",Everything is amazing except the deflective lights,"(Gateron Silver Switches-everything is great except the defective RGB)UPDATE: So bringing this from a 1 star to a solid 5 star review as the replacement I got only 2 days later has fully functional RGB with all lights working. Also, I've realized that the spacebar IS supposed to light up.Great keyboard for the price. I got an early access hotsale for $80 USD. So far happy.I really love everything about this thing, except for the 5 key not having a functional RGB light behind it. After messing with the software, I noticed that pressing the 5 key would trigger the 6 key's RGB. The space bar also does not light up, I'm not 100% sure if this is by design, or faulty as well. But in the pics, and videos, it seems like it's supposed to be Lit.Also, when trying to set the entire keyboard to white light, the light is rather blue, and the row of letter keys, as well as ASDF stay an ugly yellowish color rather than white or even a light blue.So essentially everything is great, build quality is great, the feel of the Gateron optical Silvers is AMAZING gaming. I prefer tactile switches for typing.I will update this review when I get my replacement in a couple days. Fingers Crossed. I really love this thing, but I am disappointed in the lack of quality control at this price point.",Amazing! So much value for a decent price!,"I just got this keyboard in the mail the day before yesterday, with the blue Gateron switches. I am so in love with this keyboard! I spent a lot of time researching different keyboards (I have never owned a mechanical/gaming keyboard before) and it has paid off. My previous kb was a $15 membrane one lol. This is also my first 60% kb as well, and so far I'm not missing the full layout. I almost went with either the Anne Pro 2 or the Corsair K57. The Anne Pro 2 isn't hot-swappable and the Corsair isn't even mechanical. The Anne Pro 2 also has shorter battery life. This keyboard is Bluetooth only, no dongle. I was a bit concerned about this, but I was able to get it connected to my pc in under 5 mins. Once paired, every time I go to turn my pc and kb on, it automatically connects in an instant. I have had no issues whatsoever with the connection. It's also pretty neat that I can connect and switch between two other devices if need be. Oh also after charging it the day it came in the mail, I haven't had to charge again yet. (I have also been turning it off every night before bed and putting it to sleep when I take a break from my pc.) To see how much battery is left, you'll have to download the software for it. While wired, you use the software to see the battery status. As far as I know, there is no way to know how much battery is left otherwise. This is the only thing I don't like. All in all, it's a great kb, it has a weighty feel to it and it feels great to type on.NOTE: the wrist rest in my pictures does NOT come with it. Here's a link if you like the wrist rest, it matches perfectly with it and feels nice too. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YXL6BSM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details",Good entry mechanical keyboard with options,"Exactly as described. I have different switches I‚Äôll be using (fierce girl) but straight out of the box it‚Äôs just fine.

The software to customize it is a bit clunky, but that‚Äôs in part on my end. I‚Äôm glad I went with this one versus others on Amazon.",745,84,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CV36C19

Decided to get something else and wanting something more simple but not wanting to shell out for a cafe machine. Looked at several before deciding on the Gaggia. The machine makes the best coffee I've ever tasted at home. The grind is critical if you're using the pressurized basket however so you do need to get a quality grinder.

It was easy to assemble, or I should say unfold, and it's the right height and width. There's an option to mount it to the wall which would make it easier to fold when not in use. I didn't do that with mine because it fits in the space where I placed it so I don't need to fold it down.

Set up was extremely easy and took less than five minutes--including unboxing and unwrapping. There is a small space where it looks like the corner doesn't meet the frame, and a slight ridge on the back of the desk where the folding part connects with the stationary part (both pictured). But honestly these are very minor and not a deal breaker for me.

For real specs, just see the product descriptionWireless: my last printer but had to get rid of it because it was too large was an HP Photosmart (used to print my own photos). So seeing a printer work wirelessly with the home network was really cool, never experienced a drop, so overall solid performer.Print speed: Compared to my old HP (which took forever because it would print quite high quality), this thing is a rocket, great for printing out a bunch of copies quick, lower the setting down to conserve some ink, and this thing flies even faster.Untethered Power: battery powered for some portability into certain rooms in case you need to move it around or take it with you somewhere for an event for a few hours or a day maybe. Never really tested the limits, but seems fine for light work until you find an outlet again.Misc: nothing really to be disappointed with as a casual/light user who is mainly concerned with printing up documents from time to time.Cons:Software suite: Works as should, but they really could stand to hire a form Apple UI/UX designer and just make everything more cleaner (honestly the whole company and al their products could use a freshening up)",The iPhone connected fine direct to the printer,"Magical.Had a office jet 100 but it always jammed and you couldn't print from phone.The 200 worked perfectly, is much lighter. (It is probable 2lbs less to carry than the 100, because the unit itself is 1lb lighter and it has an integrated power supply so you don't need a heavy brick as well.Prints was straight. WiFi setup was instant for iPhone. For some reason the product manual says you need another network. The iPhone connected fine direct to the printer. Nothing else needed. And printed first go with no setup other than connecting to the printer's wifi.Part of my carry on travel essentials kit going forward. The office jet 250 looks good as well but it's quite a bit bigger(60%+ more volume) and I don't need a scanner as iPhone works fine for capturing records.Bought some high quality photo paper but haven't tested it yet.",Extremely easy setup.,"Out of the box, fired up the hotspot, followed instructions and started printing. Only difficult area was ink cartridge installation. Instructions were not clear that you had to pull the lock in tab forward to latch onto the top of the ink cartridge.",but now it's up and running fine. It even has a feature to print 2 ...,We use several HP H470 model portable printers that have served us well. Decided to try the new and improved OJ 200 and I'm impressed. Seems a lot more solid than the older printers and is just as compact. Setup is a little more challenging ... took some time .... but now it's up and running fine. It even has a feature to print 2 sided copies!,So Far so Good.  Win 10 install slightly involved.,"So far so good (two weeks of use). The downloaded software did not allow my Win 10 computer to recognize the printer when hooked into my computer's USB 2.0 connection. But Win10 ""Add Printer/Device"" function did see it - and has a little tab once recognized that say ""Get App."" I believe this allowed it ti find and install the printer driver that has the utility program for the printer.Prints fast. Don't expect high color content on a mobile printer though. But it was nice to be able to fit it into my cabinet, which had an 10.75"" shelf depth.",1586,301,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HGD8T9M

Now I have convenient access to power for standard plugs and any usb devices.Pros: - Easy to install - Anker Quality & Warranty - Low CostCons: - No USB Type C (Available on higher priced models)",Great for extending a few things,"Anker seems to have a plug/extension for every situation! I love their products and have a lot of these ""extenders"" that also have USB or USB-C ports.In this case, we set up desks for our girls to do their schoolwork which requires some power (tablet/chromebook) and a USB powered LED lamp. Well, these fit the bill perfectly to allow me to get one cord from the wall outlet to their desks and power all of their accessories.It's small and light enough to just zip tie to the leg of their desk.So useful and minimal - exactly what I needed!",I Love This!,"Before I started using this awesome thing, I had a cheap crappy light beige 2 plug on side side and 1 on the other extension cord I was using for MANY years. I have no idea where it came from and I have no idea why my mother had this instead of a quality one. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I had to have this in black so I could see it and to not blend in with the carpet and I'm super happy that it was on sale for $14.99 instead of $24.99 for the 5ft one. I have this next to my bed right now and I have my iPad Air (current generation), my bed lamp, and my USB for my iPhone 11 plugged in to this little guy. I love that this has not 1 but 2 USB outlets. So handy!!! It's also not too bulky and very easy to travel with. Love that as well. The white version looks good too. I highly recommend this.",Better than an extension cord,"Searching for this taught me how difficult it is to find a simple power strip, not an extension cord, that has a cord that‚Äôs not too long and not too short. And for some reason they think everyone wants one that has a surge protector and these days has USB power charging ports built in. That‚Äôs just not reality, if you want a surge protector having one built into a cheap power strip is almost meaningless and if you want to charge your phone you probably want to use one that is powerful enough to charge it fast and has protection against harming your phone. I don‚Äôt need those things in a basic power strip. The reason I don‚Äôt use an extension cord for certain things is I need a three prong grounded plug ‚Äì most lightweight extensions don‚Äôt have that and those that do are too heavy duty.This is one of the few I found. The cord is just over five feet, a nice manageable length and the outlet end lays flat against the desktop or floor. As a bonus the plug is the flat type and even better it exits at a right angle to the wall socket so it doesn‚Äôt get it the way of the outlet above it and can be routed either up or down. The cord is more attractive looking than most extension cords as well.I tried the USB ports and they work and I‚Äôm sure they are useful for devices that work with them but for now I don‚Äôt need them. By the way, the reason I chose this one is I had to extend the power plug on a home voice assistant gadget that was about five feet shy of the power outlet. This worked out great for that purpose. Typically those have power transformers that are permanently attached to the cord and it feels like the connection is tighter and more secure with this than using an extension cord.",Great!!!,This is great!!! I love the fact that it has a flat plug in. It fits perfect behind my bed. I have my sleep number bed plugged into it as well as my charger for my iPhone. It charges fast and there have been no issues with the bed being plugged into it as well. I need more of these!,17165,972,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083XRJXSD

I use it primarily during the week for work in a corporate environment. The bags on wheels tend to slow me down a bit and briefcases for me, are tight on storage and just don't match my organizational preferences. This bag serves as the perfect mobile office for me. Lots of room/storage. 1 laptop, 1 MacBook, 1 big size happy planner, 1 classic size happy planner, lots of highlighters, pens, a binder, textbook, and still more room to go. I also use it on the weekend for our daughters volleyball tournaments. Inside I pack my work laptop, med kit, lunch and snacks for the hubs and I, iPad for recording, tripod on the side, and usually a pair of sneakers in case I want to change shoes. It's also served as a carry on bag for flights. This bag is well made and serves many purposes. Very happy that I purchased it. I am very picky when it comes to functionality of bags and this was a great purchase.",Perfect Backpack for the Working Professional,"I absolutely love this backpack. I switched from a very nice messenger bag to a backpack when I realized that my thirty-something body could no longer comfortably handle lugging around my work materials, lunch, and other junk to and from the office on my commute that often involves public transportation. Besides, I'm in tech and a lot of my peers have been using backpacks for ages anyway, so it's not weird to be a grown adult wearing one. Right?I really enjoy the following about this backpack:- It's not basic black- It has pockets a-plenty- It comfortably fits my slim notebook laptop- It's water-resistant. The weather generally stinks where I live and this is a legit concern when it comes to toting nice bags.- So many pockets- It's lightweight- I can fit my lunch bag inside without it bulging precariously like my messenger bag did- Seriously, there are a ton of pockets",Holds a lot!,"I am very impressed with this bag, thus far. I have only had it about a week, so we will see how it holds up to the weight of textbooks over time. It has excellent padding on the handle, straps, and on the back of the bag. I was concerned that it would not expand to fit my books and folders, but it has not disappointed! Once I stuffed all of my gear into it, it expanded to about 8‚Äù wide. The front compartment has odds & ends in it. The middle compartment has two 3 ring binders and a LARGE textbook in it. The back compartment has my iPad, several notebooks, and a wad of pens in it. Pics of all 3 compartments included. This bag holds A LOT! I haven‚Äôt even used the smaller outer compartments, and I fit a lot more in it than I thought I could. The fabric is nice and it seems to be very well made. The last bag I had only had one compartment and everything got jumbled around. I love the separate compartments of this bag because they keep everything organized. Excellent buy!",51807,11,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XZTZ7GB

Easy setup, great bristles.I have a dog so I sweep almost every day. Over the holiday weekend, even 2-3 times a day due to visitors.This broom and dustpan have done their job very well!*will update if anything changes*",It's not the number one seller for no reason,"I just ordered my second one. I reordered the gray one again. I see some people are having trouble assembling it. It's no problem at all. The handle for the dustpan is a form fit. You may need to bend the plastic attachment every so gently in order for the lips in the trough to line up properly. It requires almost zero effort.Yes the handle to the broom does come in 3 sections that all snap together thanks to the little spring loaded ball that pops out preventing it from coming apart; that is unless you want it to, then you can press the ball in and slide it apart.I find no play in the broom handle at all. No looseness, not even a little bit. If someone sweeps their floor in anger and wants to bend the handle, then yes it is possible to overexert yourself, and as with any tool, it can get deformed.This is a super inexpensive broom. I am really happy with the way it picks up dirt, and with the tapered, angled brush head you can get a little bit under your bed or cabinetry without having to bend over. It makes for a very clear sweep too. I'm sorry to see some people having problems with it. I don't know so don't take my word for it, but maybe the blue one is manufactured differently? This one screws into the brush section perfectly, easily, and tightens down just right. Once again, if someone is in a bad mood and they want to force it together without any caution to line up the threads, then yes they can strip it out. It takes just about zero effort to start gently making sure they align. Great broom. Highly recommended.",Nice design,I like this broom and dustpan. It sets up easily and fits into ourstorage closet. I had a blue one but tried the grey color and preferthat. The blue is really bright. I would recommend this product. I'mhappy to have 2 now-1 for upstairs and 1 in the garage!,6677,265,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RB7T9GL

I do buy coffee beans online and grind my own, and also will use the actual k-cups, which I'm not a fan of. The Bunn is definitely not as quick as a Keurig machine, but while I'm preparing breakfast, I start the brewing, and it's done within 5 minutes since I measure out 24oz of water; so about 5 cups of coffee on the pot's cup indicator. Haven't made a full pot yet, but I'm sure it will take about 8-10 minutes. Easy cleanup too. Brews so nice and hot. It is a tall machine, like 16"" so it does not fit under my cabinets on the countertop. It actually just meets the bottom of the cabinet. But It works out fine for me as I have a lot of space.

Teal is Standard size, Dark blue is Oversized.","Awesome, figured out a trick!",I shared this product on my instagram story with a ‚Äúhow to‚Äù to make this work without having to bring the wire from the bottom and then up. The 3 ft wire never would‚Äôve worked and 9 ft wire was too long! I had so many questions and comments it was just easier to make a video!!I literally removed the plate from the outlet and turned the outlet plugs upside down and replaced the plate. This way the wire went straight up. No problems! It‚Äôs easier to place the double sided tape on the wire all the way up and then use a level and just stick it to the wall! Completely in love! Those wires were destroying my soul before this!,Love it,"Very very nice. I am a renter so putting a huge hole in the wall to hire my wires was not going to happen, after searching for something that can help with the look of the wires in my living room I am glad to have come across this socket! I love love it. I just installed it last night, I‚Äôm extremely happy with the look and the adhesive works really good. I highly recommend. Take a look st my before and after pics :)",Exactly what we needed!!!,"We lowered our baby boys crib and were reminded that there was a plugin behind the crib. Unfortunately this was the primary useful plugin in his bedroom. The other was sitting right next to the heater and we didn‚Äôt want to have to run an extension cord across the room to have his sound machine, baby monitor and humidifier plugged in next to his crib.This was the perfect solution! We were using a shelf board while we waited. We were afraid he might be able to pull out the socket covers if he found them. He‚Äôs a sneaky little monkey.I will update this review if this thing stops working or blows up. But right now we are thrilled with our purchase and so glad we don‚Äôt have to worry about fingers in electrical outlets at the moment.",Small item makes a BIG difference.,"We have a corner unit for our videogame systems & unfortunately the electrical socket is behind one of the sides of it, so an extension cord or surge protector is required. Either option forces the corner unit to be a good distance away from the wall & makes it an eyesore due to the gap between the wall & it. This product lessens that gap big time! I've attached before (1 & 2) & after (3 & 4) pictures from both the side & top views. The covering face plate is actually thinner than our baseboards that the corner unit is touching! Only drawback is the cost; it's basically an expensive extension cord, but was worth it for our needs! Hopefully this company will make an updated version in the future that is also a surge protector.",27433,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TMPJP63

Darn it though, I was taking a break from chargers for a bit (take a look at my reviews to see what I mean, or give me a follow) but I saw this drop and had to get one. It looks almost exactly like the iconic Apple 5w unit included in the box with every iphone for the last 8 years...EXCEPT THIS ONE KICKS BUTT.I have been using this unit for a week or so as of this review, and using this charger to recharge my XS max, iPhone XR, and iPad Pro 2018 with no issue. I have tried Anker, Aukey, Choetech, and Apple cables on it and they all work fine. I ran it on my MacBook Pro 13 for a couple days (float charge, just keeping it at 100%) and it was warm and upset - but performed flawlessly not tripping on thermal or going beyond 20w.Now if you have read my reviews in the past you know I panned Anker for their PowerPort Atom 30w PD unit for being reasonably sized and not having folding prongs. On the PowerPort III Nano, I am ok with it. It is still small enough to disappear into your pocket that the prongs don‚Äôt bother me.The finish currently available is a white matte square-tube design with a silver ANKER logo on the side, and slightly bubbled gloss white face with IQ3 on it. Although a little larger than the Apple unit, if I handed it to you in the dark you couldn‚Äôt tell the difference. There are no LED‚Äôs that I could see whatsoever, and the 120vac prongs stuck in every outlet I tested without issue.Overall, this is not an all-in-one USB-C charger that I would recommend for your laptop, Nintendo Switch, etc. I would however recommend it for:- Anyone looking for a compact/power-dense charger to keep in your pocket or bag, this is it.- Anyone getting a new pro iphone and excited to try usb-c to lightning and ‚Äòfast charging‚Äô - just leave the gigantic Apple unit in the box and get this one.- If you love the Apple 5w design and just wish it was faster, this is the charger for you.When I bought it it was 19.99$ which was a fair price considering the current its capable of. But I am hoping we will see these hit 15$ for Holiday 2019 and/or a combo deal with a cable for under 25$. Either way , if you are buying this for 20$ or less its a value. Over that, you start to get into some more competent options that have more current available (RAVpower comes to mind).So far this unit has been very reliable despite my attempts to torture it. If anything changes, I will update this review to reflect that immediately.I hope you found my review helpful - if you did, thank you.If you did not, please leave me something in the comments or a question so I can make it right.Thanks for reading my review,-Chris",Very impressed üëç,"I‚Äôm very impressed. It‚Äôs almost the same size as apple 5w charger. It charges my phone very fast and I‚Äôm happy that I made purchase.I also attached some pictures comparing with some other chargers( Anker PowerPort Atom PD1, Aukey 18w PD and apple5w)Highly recommend ‚úÖ",Favorite Purchase in the Past Six Months,"I love this thing. It really is as small as the useless charger that Apple provides and yet charges as well as a Powerbook power brick. Great product no matter what, but you absolutely MUST get one of these if you fly or travel a lot. It's perfect for charging in flight.",Small charger,About the Same size as old Apple charger but with way more power,"I love new efficient tech, and Anker did it again","I recently listened to a Vergecast podcast with the CEO of Anker on it and he was explaining and new type of metal that would be eventually used in chargers in order to make them faster and smaller (who doesn't want those two combined?). I really didn't think it would come out any time soon but these guys are on it!I got the charging brick today so I can't say anything about how durable it is (although, have you ever had a TINY charging brick break??? I legit wanna hear how THAT happened) but I'm sure that's not an issue. I already have a USB-C to USB-C charging cable, so I was able to test it out on three different things:- My OnePlus 5T phone (charged it quickly, I was impressed)- My Sony WH-1000XM3 headphone (charged it too, sometimes these things won't charge my headphones but this works!!!)- My new laptop: Yoga 730 (has two USB-C ports you can charge from - more below).I'm super impressed that this LITTLE TINY THING CAN ACTUALLY CHARGE A LAPTOP!!! That said, 18W for a laptop is not enough (it charged it from 62% to 66% in 15 minutes with bluetooth on, wifi on and active, and screen at 80% - but I didn't use the computer in that time). So it only charged it 4% in 15 minutes while I left it alone, so I would use this in a tight situation where I would want an overnight charger and have very little packing space, not something to charge while I work. My normal laptop charger is 65W, which is what is needed for my laptop to charge WHILE I work (I do some intensive video editing and instructional design work). But this could be a great overnight type of charger.But if you want to have ONE TINY LITTLE CHARGER that can charge it all, this is amazingly it.CAUTION: it is a USB-C charger. You have to have the right cable for it. It's very simple to find one on Amazon and I would get Anker's USB-C charging cables but just be aware of what type of cable you need.Again, very surprised this type of tech actually is becoming so cheap and available already. Huge Kudos to Anker!",67894,4,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WRKXQ8W

Like when you want to select a Yes or No from an option you use the ""."" on the number pad -- you won't find that with the specific programming instructions.I had the machine up and running in about 45 minutes. Customized the 6 lines of logo, added tax rates, added departments with titles, created the memory card folders... all that jazz.Tip: Do not try to enter characters by using the key pad (1 = a, b or c) -- it sucks! Once you get the hang of using the 3 digit codes you'll get really good, really fast -- and it's waaay better at getting at special characters -- so easy!Tip 2: Install the 2 AA batteries in the battery pack (under the register paper cover and on the left side where a journal tape would go). The instructions for the batteries are buried and once you lose power or unplug it all your work will be gone.

Representing a fairly standard document page, it is about 0.5MB.JPEG mode is more useful than PDF mode, as all you get in PDF mode is the same image wrapped in an A4 paper size, and you get one file per scan in either mode. As a US user who does not work with European paper sizes, if I want a PDF it makes more sense to scan JPEG files and import them into software such as LibreOffice, which allows exporting a multi-page PDF in whatever paper size I choose. I probably will almost never use the PDF scanning mode.The scanner comes complete with everything except two AA batteries and a MicroSD card. I used NiMH rechargeable batteries and a generic 16GB SDHC card. Because the documentation claims support up to 32GB cards, this suggests larger SDXC cards are not supported, but I did not bother trying. The card is formatted as standard FAT, and can be formatted in the device using a paper clip to trigger a recessed button.The scanner has a MiniUSB (not MicroUSB) jack, but includes a cable to connect to a standard computer full-size Type A USB jack. On my Ubuntu Linux laptop this is plug-and-play with no drivers or software (like plugging in a USB drive), and upon connecting the scanner appears as a folder with JPEG and PDF files in the directory ""DCIM/100MEDIA"" that can be opened or copied using any ordinary method.One oddity is that, at least under Linux, the time has to be set on the scanner in UTC so its files are timestamped correctly. Setting the time on the scanner is easy and well documented, using a paper clip to enter and exit ""time set"" mode with a recessed button, using the ""scan"" button to page through year-month-day-hour-minute and the JPEG/PDF button for ""up"" and the ""DPI"" button for ""down"" in each field.Even without using the USB connection at all, the card is ordinary FAT format and therefore can be read directly by removing it from the scanner and inserting it into a computer, with JPEG and PDF files accessible for opening and copying.Instructions are included for calibrating white balance, and this is presumably important if what you are scanning is in color, but my particular usage is almost exclusively black-and-white.Results from this scanner are much better than I expected for such a small and portable device at a $50 price point. It solved my problem better than any alternative I could find.",Amazing,"This is a great hand scanner. I use this in Historical archives that allow hand scanners. It works wonderfully, the above image was scanned with the scanner (on its lowest resolution setting). I was very skeptical about purchasing this, but I do not regret it. It has multiple resolution settings and can save as a single page PDF or a single JPG (or image). There are plenty of online resources to take a batch of JPGs/PDFs and compile them into a searchable PDF. This is very useful for archival work. I would recommend a flat surface and a smooth scanning motion. The scanner has rubber cylindrical wheels that allow for smooth scanning without damaging the document. It also works wonderfully on books (which can be a hassle to scan with a traditional scanner. Highly recommend!",Scanner on the go,"I bought the scanner after some research and for a specific purpose: I wished to scan some document from a safety deposit box without removing them (I was legally one the box owners, BTW). Someone else on the Amazon reviews provided a superb ""how to"" that I followed. The iScan did exactly what it was said to do: take color scans of any document. There's no need to remove staples, a huge help in scanning legal documents. It's so handy that we now carry it on most trips since we never know when we might need to capture a photo, business card, or document, and it's small enough to fit anywhere. We recommend this device! Do NOT forget that you need an SD card, too.","Handy full page scanner for your briefcase, scans legacy photo albums a page at a time!","I bought this to enable scanning of essential paperwork and photos when I had to move Mom into Assisted Living. Easy to use--just slide it down the page, rollers permit linear tracking so skew is not an issue. Copies onto a micro SD (I used an old cell phone card). Pop out the micro SD, put it into an adapter, read it with your computer. Small, compact, lightweight, works really well and is faster than my cell phone scan app. Now a permanent resident in my briefcase. OBTW - you can capture photo albums a page at a time with it. Not the best photo quality, but far better than losing a lifetime of memories without having to remove the photos from the pages and scan separately (big-time PITA).",Don't Overthink This- It's a helpful device,"First- This scanner isn't what you're looking for IF....- You want to easily scan pages from a book. It's possible, but not easily done.-If you want to scan items larger than a standard 8 1/2 by 11in piece of paper. Apparently it is possible to do a continuous scan, but not easily and there is no one to show you how.Second- This scanner is great for...-Bookkeepers-Scanning receipts, single page invoices, newspaper articles.TIPS:1. It clearly states that it must have a micro sd card that is sold separately. It mentions that it's micro sd card capacity is 32GB, so you'd think you could buy a 64GB card and expect to only use half the storage... WRONG. The scanner only wants micro sd cards at 32GB or less.2. The scanner comes with a usb cable, but that doesn't mean it will scan without a micro sd card, because it won't. You must have a micro sd card inserted for it to scan.3. Skip setting the time and date on the device... you'll just end up moving the doc. to the folder you want and renaming it later...which changes the doc to the current date.4. You need a flat area and a steady hand, oh and go slow until you get the hang of it.5. I do my scans as PDF. You can always scan a number of single pages and then while you are uploading to your computer you can combine the single page scans into a single PDF and organize what goes first.",462,18,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W12R334

The manual suggests sticking a cork screw in the middle of the speaker grille to remove it, so I did. Ruined that grille in the process by warping the hole I pulled on. The best way to remove grille is to slightly lift (with corkscrew) on the very edge hole and then rotate, pick another hole and lift some more (like opening a can of paint, but slowly).I called Polk to get a new grille to replace the one I ruined expecting to pay a few bucks but they sent me one for free!",Amazing!,"We have 4 of these on our decks and powered by a Crown amplifier at 4 ohm per channel (150w x 2). They sound so amazing that you boarder line don't need a sub (but that helps). What will say is we had a OSD amplifier powering them and it's rather at 100 per channel and at the time it was only powering 2 of these and it's not even close to how it sounds with a proper amplifier, doesn't even sound like the same speakers. So, make sure you have a nicer amplifier to see the full potential of these. Lastly, we have them in a roof with 10 inch beams and we boxed in the speaker for a quasi enclosure, this helps out with the bass in my opinion.",1877,574,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006BMQT

I ordered this one - and am very happy with it. I like the flat cord which minimizes any rolling or twisting of the cord. It is very durable, and I know it will last for many years to come. Highly recommend.Update 07/2015I had to haul long sheets of sheet metal in back of my vehicle, and needed a way to secure the load so it would not slide out of the back of my vehicle. (The tailgate of my vehicle opens upward, so there is nothing to prevent the load from sliding out). I used this Flat Bungee cord, and I put a small 8 lb bag of kitty litter on the sheet metal. It was perfect! It held the load tightly - even when I drove over bumps and holes in the road. When my vehicle went uphill to get home, this cord held the load securely. Will be ordering more.",Always Good to Have,"Bungee cords are always good to have around; they have a myriad uses. These seem durable and have shown no visible wear and tear after almost a year of use around the house and even in outdoor uses like on touring bikes and the like. They just get stained with mud and other dirt; we have not attempted to clean them but it's probably quite possible to hand-wash them in some soft, non-abrasive soap. Their hooks are quite massive, not the thin, wiry stuff you find on other bungees, so you've got to think ahead about where they may or may not fit. The hooks are coated with some thick, plastic resin so they will not scratch or otherwise damage the stuff you're strapping with them.",Excellent quality,"Versatile, strong, easy to adjust. Large strong hooks grab any size edge or railing. Hooks do not break off under tension. I use these bungees to hold my trash can cover closed so raccoons or other critters can‚Äôt scavenge and make a mess out of my garbage. These were a fine solution for that.Also keeps cargo like a case of water held tight to the carrier behind my motor scooter seat. Nothing falls off while I ride home. Terrific value for this price.",FLAT style bungee cord,"I love this little thing, got two of them and I keep them in my truck (inside) to anchor down things (duh!) I like that the strap itself is FLAT and can NOT roll...AND the hooks are nice and large, EASY to connect to one another or a hook inside your vehicle even if you have arthritic hands. These can also hook to one another to make a longer single bungee if need be. I would suggest this style to anyone!",4939,489,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0044FPNIG

You only get a started pack of film so it's a good idea to buy more when you buy this. Especially at first you tend to print a LOT of pictures. I bought both people a 50 pack of film.

It may seem rather gimmicky, but in truth the idea is excellent for particular uses. I am not at all disappointed.The only con was the pairing directions which were vague.

Here's what I needed after my last ABC coffee maker broke down within a year like the five before that did. I'm done, I'm going with the best without all the bells and whistles. Look, I want a cup of coffee, I want it fast, no clocks no timers no bells and whistles give me a dragster of a coffee pot system and this is it, I'm telling you this brews within a minute and a half, just make darn sure you buy high top Bunn filters and you got yourself a fast cup of coffee. You want a reference, just look at what all the commercial coffee shops and restaurants use, its bunn and they last. All coffee makers Brew the same they're based on 10 minute system, 6 to heat the water four to brew, this keeps a reservoir of water that's always heated just keep it plugged in, the cost is pennies in the month, as soon as you pour in the water, stick the carafe underneath and it's already Brewing this is really a minute-and-a-half brew and 0 to heat system. I'm sold, thank you bunn!!! (Update): Electricity went out, not good, stressed out, I need a cup of coffee!!! Hold it! It's pre-heated in the reservior, I wonder, I added cold water, placed carafe in and... Fingers crossed... BAM! A HOT cup of coffee in the dark. Ahhhhh, TY Bunn!!!",Coffeemaker is as Coffeemaker does,"I've seen some reviews for the Bunn that just make me scratch my head. Let's be clear, I want my coffeemaker to do one thing well--Make Coffee! And the Bunn does this very well. I've owned Bunn's over the years and have always found them awesome and reliable and definitely worth the extra money IF you like a good cup of coffee. I don't need my coffeemaker to tell me the time, or automatically brew me coffee, or brush my teeth or blow my nose. I just want it to make a good cup of coffee and trust me, the Bunn does not disappoint.Now, to address some people's concerns: Yes, you have to wait until the whole pot is brewed before getting a cup. There is no stopper when you pull the pot out. And the problem here is? It's got a hot water tank so it can brew a 10 cup pot before I come back from getting the paper. People, we're talking about a couple of minutes. If you want to sacrifice the quality of your coffee for an auto pullout feature, have at it. As for having to call Bunn for a water flow restrictor, I mean, I don't know what that's all about. Like I said, I've owned Bunn's before and I own this one now and have already brewed dozens upon dozens of pots with it and haven't had a single issue, and never have had an issue.Bottom line: maybe a little pricey, but well worth the dollars. Made to brew a good cup of coffee. No fancy settings cause it doesn't need it. Won't read your horoscope but will make reading your horoscope more enjoyable with your morning coffee.",Perfect Coffee Every Time,"As far as I'm concerned, I'll never own another brand of coffee maker. When this one dies, I'll buy another one. No bells, no whistles, no timer, no fuss. Just awesome coffee each and ever day. Prepare the coffee at night, pour the water into the magic water hole in the morning, close the lid, turn on the hot plate. Coffee is quietly brewed and ready to drink in a matter of minutes. Do not pour the water into the magic water hole at night, though. It will seep. Also, don't forget to turn off the hot plate; there's no timer. Or weren't you listening when I said no bells/whistles? :)Peace.",It‚Äôs perfect once you receive the separate flow restrictor,"So, I was on the verge of returning this item because the basket overflowed and made a mess and my coffee tasted like crap. I read the reviews and saw others comments about contacting Bunn for a FREE flow restrictor (I requested one on their website). It came within a week and it‚Äôs made a world of difference. Coffee tastes how it‚Äôs supposed to with no overflow. I rated the material quality a 3 because it should come with the proper gadget. I had to deal with a mess, do research, then wait for my part.It‚Äôs great now-just be sure to get the free part!","Best Coffee Maker Ever.  Fast brew, manual on/off hot plate and perfect coffee pour every time.  Bunn has a fan for life.","This is the best coffee maker in the history of mankind. I drink alot of coffee. Bunn makes spare pots and funnels easily available for purchase so I always have a clean pot with a clean funnel ready to go. Now that we have clean supplies just drop in your filter, couple scoops of grounds and you have a hot pot of coffee in less than 3 minutes. The coffee warmer has a manual switch so the coffee stays hot all day! Want a cup of coffee at 4pm.. no problem! No more cold coffee! There are other features I love about this coffee maker like the coffee pot lid has this cool little plastic device that makes it really easy to pour a cup of coffee without it dripping everywhere. My previous coffee maker had the water reservoir in the back of the coffee maker so I always had to pull it out away from the wall (usually tugging on the power cord), pull apart the coffee maker and unseat a huge water jug. The Bunn is really easy. Just fill your coffee pot with water, pour it into the top of the coffee maker, put the pot into the coffee maker and close the lid. Why does every other coffee maker company make things so difficult?",1582,432,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FFRZ2Q

My husband restores old cars and we keep billing sheets with backup receipts in case he wants to sell one of the cars after it's completed and wants to show the work that went into it. This has turned into a paperwork hassle and using my printer (networked but at the other end of the house from my laptop in the kitchen) to scan is also a hassle. So I've been looking at this unit and finally decided to buy it. I'm still doing the basics - setting up files and playing; with it but I can see that this has a lot of potential. I bought the portable unit which is handy as I don't work at a desk; use my kitchen counter and don't really need a hopper for large numbers of items to be scanned at once. So far it operates smoothly and seems to do everything I want and I keep coming up with new uses for it. Fortunately I have no problems with lopsided scanning like another customer found. I'm still wrestling with the idea of whether to buy into their cloud or export copies to my computer file and upload them to my existing free Google cloud as backup. I think that for me that will work but if I had a LOT of scanning to be done on a daily basis, the Neat cloud is probably a better idea. I am editing this because it's two days later and I've found more uses for this handy little item. Used to keep copies of possible recipes in folders. Not anymore. They're scanned now by category. How cool is that!!!! I also occasionally attend cooking classes where they give us handouts. They're all scanned, too. So this has turned into a filing cabinet of various things -- the car receipts, tax receipts and cooking paperwork. So for me, this has turned into a very useful product.",Very organized scanner,"I thought twice before buying this item because of plenty of negative reviews but figured I could return it if it would not work. Now that I have used it for the past week, I am now sold on this product and I am not sure why other people had so much problems.Installation - I installed the ver 5 software from the company's website and it asked me for product key which I copied from the CD envelope. I personally don't like installing from CDs anymore as normally it's not as updated as the website. After installing the software, I hooked up the scanner via USB and that was it. I inserted the receipt and clicked scan and it did it perfectly. I saw one review saying there was no image and so I was thinking he probably did not know that the receipt has to be FACE DOWN. This process took me only about 10 mins, most of it was to download the software.Organization - The OCR worked well, it captured the amount, sales tax, vendor name very well. I only had problems if the receipt was too long especially those receipts from Costco that are about 20 inches long so I had to manually change the amount. Searching for items worked well too.Exporting - I tried exporting to Excel and I absolutely loved it because it is presented like an expense report and the scanned images of the receipt are on the second tab. This works for me to in archiving my receipts.I haven't tried the exporting to Quickbooks or TurboTax and I don't see a lot of reviews about that, so please comment on this on your experience if any.",perfect,"I travel almost weekly and expense reports have always been a pain. Not anymore with this scanner! (and the software). Like you can read, this scans the receipts and auto imports into the database in the software that is included. I was able to make an excel template off the expense form my company uses with custom fields and it creates the expense form in the format I need. It would be nice to be able to customize more fields and expense categories for more customization, but it works fine.There is a subscription based feature set that allows for mobile scanning and an online database for heavy users, but using locally on my laptop does fine. Now I can't wait to scan in receipts. I just leave it out in my hotel room and at night just quickly scan in the receipts and on the plane home pop out an expense report ready to go.There are a few more sw features that would make life even more easier, but this is still 100% easier than the process I was using before.The only hw glitch is when it feeds docs it kind of skews them a bit as it feeds in and is a bit tricky to get it exactly aligned while feeding in full page docs. I have to rescan a couple of docs if it gets too out of alignment.",Exactly as advertised,"I love this thing!!!! It truly does what it says it will do, and the price is right at Amazon. I'm a legal guardian and representative payee for a disabled adult receiving government funds. In that capacity I'm required to keep receipts for all expenses including groceries, medications, doctors visits, copays, etc.... Literally everything he spends money on must have documentation. I have to create a report for each month's expenses, too. Until I got the Neat Receipts, I had a filing cabinet filled with nothing but receipts, and spent hours each month totaling up expenses. I keep receipts for five years in case there is ever an issue. After installing the software and setting up my folders and settings, it only took about 2 hours to scan in six months worth of receipts. That was hundreds of receipts, mostly groceries, grooming and personal care items, and medical supplies. My filing cabinet is now empty, and totals for each month are accurate. Wow!There are a few issues. The program doesn't always recognize the Vendor Name, or chooses the wrong number on the receipt as the total, along with some other easily remedied issues. Everything is editable, and the scanned receipt is right there to view. The program does all the addition for you. Furthermore, you can easily rename folders, move things to other folders, create reports. It's accepted by the IRS! No technology is perfect, but Neat Receipts has simplified my life. I highly recommend this gadget.",So far absolutely GREAT!,"while I was skeptical on reading the variety of negative comments my office was out of control so I was willing to try anythingIn just the first 3 days I have had this and after filling FOUR waste baskets of receipts and papers that I will never have to shuffle again all I can say is Thanks NeatReceipts!I am sure there may be some other better OCR software and stuff around etc but I am not a techno geek nor computer whiz so while yes the occassional receipt offers the system a challenge and I have to take an extra 3 minutes to enter the correct info into the categories but 97% of the time it is simply a matter of deciding what tax category the item fits into and storing it into the proper folder. While I have a pretty high end scanner printer fax machine the speed with which this little scanner runs a receipt is pretty impressive for the money.The business card function works just as effectively. Now to be honest I have not tried to merge data as of yet so the jury is still out but I didn't really purchase this for contact management. For the straightforward application of scanning, sorting and storing receipts for tax purposes I would say it's already well on it's way to paying for itself. For the record I am talking about NeatReceipts 4.0 and am running it on Windows 7.I have a family member who is worse than me with their home office and papers and I will likely be wrapping one of these up for Christmas for him and will his wife ever be happy too!Sorry to be so repetetive but I am just thrilled with the 20+ pounds of paper that left my office this morning never to return or be moved around from one spot to the other and the backup function to my portable hard disk was seemless. My accountant is ecstatic about never again getting a shoebox with items paperclipped together.My order was easy and quicky delivered in two days.Thanks Amazon and NeatWorks!",1423,405,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001CQFRPO

First. This saves so much time getting layout down for a painting so I can concentrate on the painting without worrying if my proportions are correct, things level, etc. Serious time saver from 100% hand drawn under painting. Second. Yes it means it when it says Dark Room. It really works better, images more crisp, etc when you can be in total darkness whether that's an inside hallway or room darkening curtains. The darker, the better. Third: surprise: it even worked when I wanted to paint an icy trees-heavy snow night scene on a black canvas. Instead of drawing lines in black, I sketched with white colored pencil. Made getting proportions right a breeze. Highly recommended! Will probably start looking for interchangeable lenses soon...","Projects, stays cool with energy efficient bulb","I'm giving this thing 5 stars because it works as expected and is great for hobbyists and small business. I am almost finished with a painting that I started using this thing. It is amazing for drawing accurate images. Don't listen to all the reviews about this thing running hot. Mine came with an energy efficient bulb, and I am soon going to replace it with a super bright LED bulb. Yes, it is dim with old incandescent bulbs, but why even bother with them when you can have 100W brightness with a cool LED or florescent bulb? You will need to work in a dark room to use this, just like any projector. If you're looking for a good deal, this is it. These sell at art stores for $120, and if you're into making backdrops, or murals, or just painting your kids walls, this thing works great. If you aren't willing to spend a few bucks to get a really good LED bulb, this will still work, but you will need to let your eyes adjust, especially if you are drawing or working on a canvas that isn't white. I STRONGLY urge you to buy a super bright LED bulb along with this. The brighter the better, within the wattage limits on this enlarger.The largest image you can copy from is a 5 inch by 5 inch picture. It sounds tiny, but all you have to do is get a picture or image you want to enlarge, and print it out using the computer to reduce it to a 5x5"" picture. Grid your work out, and do one section at a time. I just finished an 8ft by 8ft backdrop using this method, and it worked great. I received a ton of compliments on the quality. If you have any questions about this thing, feel free to ask.",Great for someone with no drawing skills,"My drawing skills are about the level of stick people. I wanted to draw some holiday designs on wood to paint and someone suggested using a projector. After reading the reviews, I made sure I was in a very dark room and put the glass from a picture frame over the original images. It was relatively easy to use, even for someone completely inexperienced like myself. It worked great for what I needed.",I want artists like me on a budget to know this will make ...,You do not need an expensive projector!! The color and clarity it gives is nuts! 5x5 copy space not a problem it magnifies photos extremely well!!!!! Came with bulb broken buy new one and watch what it can do.I want artists like me on a budget to know this will make very very happy it did me.,Love it. Wish I would have bought it sooner!,"I absolutely adore this product! At first, I thought it was going to be a ""starter projector,"" and that I would have to produce many paintings to save up for a better one, but I might never need a ""better one"" because this little bugger is just perfect for me. I sell paintings in various sizes: 11x14, 18x20, and 8x10's but you can even use this projector to paint an entire wall. It's amazing; you can still see the projected image with a lamp on in the room so you don't have to work in total darkness.Not only do I use this for outlines of figures but I also use it for details. For example, if I'm doing a painting of a woman wearing a floral dress, I can trace every little floral design on her dress.It *did* take a little bit of getting used to, (knowing how big to print the image to be traced for the desired painting size) but that's the same with anything you're using for the first time. I save an incredible amount of time in tracing than I used to by painstakingly graphing everything out by hand. I'm amazed with the accuracy I have with this after just a little practice and am happier with my traced images than I was with the ones that took weeks to grid out and meticulously determine.Definitely well worth the money. It's portable and lightweight.",1017,169,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KNHRG2

I will be using this unit in my bathroom for added storage.BONUS: I added legs to my unit because I don't like my furniture flush against the floor, plus it has a nicer appeal. I found all of the supplies at Lowe's. *I would definitely recommend attaching a safety strap to secure it to the wall, as the added legs also adds height to the unit and it may become top-heavy and tip over. Especially if you have small children.*BEFORE ATTACHING THE DOORS TO THE UNIT, FOLLOW STEPS 1 & 2 BELOW:1. Once the frame of the unit is assembled with the two sides and shelves in place, place the unit face-side down, on its front side (finished edges down, rough unfinished edges up) and attach the backing with the tacking nails provided.2. Attach the metal magnet plates to the doors. This allows better control while drilling the screws into place. Remember, the doors do not have pre-drilled holes for anything except the handles.DOORS:3. Attach the bottom door hinges directly to the doors with the designated screws. (*Place the top hinge on the door just to mark and begin drilling the hole. DO NOT screw in all the way! Remove the screw, set it aside, then place the top hinge back into its respective slot on the unit. Top hinges need to be in place on the unit in order for the doors to slide into them. Next, place the door with the bottom hinge fully attached into its respective slot first, THEN slide the top of the door into the hinge (already in place) and fasten the top hinge to the door with the screw. (Repeat these steps for remaining doors.)*Handles can be attached before or after the doors are in place. This is the simplest step of all, since the holes are pre-drilled, so it's completely your choice.*Disclaimer: The above steps are what worked for ME to ease MY assembly process, which I discovered and used at various points in addition to the original instructions.

This broom's bristles are so smooth to glide along the floor, yet sturdy enough to hold up to daily use. The dust pan with handle is quality made and catches all the crumbs without having you bend down. Such a back saver! I would recommend, however, if you are using the broom to dust your entire house, and often, to request the free extension pole to lengthen the broom handle, so you do not have to bend at all. It makes the whole product perfect and worth every penny! Highly recommend this product. You can not find one as good at any of the big chain stores or grocery stores.",Great product! Wish I bought it sooner,"No more back breaking for me! I foster with an animal rescue. My house is a revolving door for many animals everyday on top of residents. Between hair and litter, cleaning daily is a must! I lover that the pan sits lever to the floor so all debris goes right in. The teeth are long enough to clean the bristles off with no problems. About the length of the broom handle- The broom came without the extension. This was foreign to me as I am used to a much longer broom handle. I contacted the seller as instructed. Received immediate response and an extension was shipped out right away. In the meantime, I continued to use the broom without it. Now that is has arrived, I have to say I like it much better with the shorter handle. It's easier to keep one hand controlling the dust pan and the other controlling the broom when the handle on the broom is shorter. My advice would be to use it for a week with the shorter handle before requesting the extension. You may find it easier to use. All in all, great product! will buy again and also give some as gifts!",Very nice,"My old broom was falling apart and this one is so much sturdier. I don't know what changes the quality of the bristles but these are very nice. I really like the little rubber spike things, it allows you to wipe off the bristles each time you use it.

Not a lot of waste in the packaging. Yay! I am always afraid of stinky smells with the plastic, but there was absolutely no plastic smell. It was super easy to put together. The sticker on the pan came off easily with no residue. I‚Äôm going to enjoy the broom cleaner part, but it does bend easily. I HATE bending down to sweep dust into a pan...the dirt always ends up in my face. This is exactly what I was looking for. After actually using it, I noticed that there is a yellow rubber strip at the front to help get the dirt in without having that annoying dirt line left over. I am super impressed!

I did not want a bunch of batteries rolling around in that ‚Äújunk drawer‚Äù we all have, not knowing what‚Äôs charged and what‚Äôs not.

It‚Äôs a great product that‚Äôs easy to open and easy to see through to determine what type of batteries are inside.",Recommend These Polypropylene Battery Boxes for Energizer Batteries.,"These boxes do well to hold my AA and AAA batteries in place. I shake the boxes a lot, and the boxes do not open suddenly nor do the batteries move around randomly inside the box. Even when the boxes are half full, the batteries still stay in place. The boxes are designed from POLYPROPYLENE, and inside them are beams to prevent them from moving horizontally, but they can still move vertically, but I don't mind that. There are no wall to separate live from dead batteries, but I think that is what the beams are for. I used Energizer batteries for this review, so this I cannot say this box is a good fit for all batteries brands. Other than that, the box did its job to secure and store my batteries. I can easily place them anywhere without worrying about space, especially a shelf.(1/19/19): It has been over a year since I bought these battery cases, and they are still strong and long-lasting.",I use a LOT OF BATTERIES!!,"Having kids in the house, especially little ones, you use a LOT of batteries for their toys and things, and sometimes it's a hassle to keep cutting the battery container (that holds like 48 batteries) open and taping it closed and cutting it open again, so I just grab a couple of these and stock up, and then every time I need batteries, it takes me like 3 seconds to grab a couple of batteries and shut the lid. Voila! I first bought these (for a lot more $$) at The Container Store. When I saw them on-line for so cheap I couldn't believe it! They are the same container at less than half the price. They shut tightly, too! Awesome!",A must have if you use batteries,"Never dig for your batteries again! Used for years to protect the AA and AAA batteries I carry in my computer bag, in my car trunk, the junk drawer and in my camper. I label the container with a note as to when the batteries expire so I use the oldest first. There is a divider that keeps batteries from banging around in the case and can be used to separate newer batteries from older. After having a bad battery ruin a bunch of stuff in a drawer and digging around for batteries that were dead I found these containers to be a money saver too! Another benefit - A quick glance tells you when the kids raided your stash and you need to get more. Also I use the containers to keep rechargeables separate from single-use to make sure they do not get mixed.",Great Battery Holder at the Right Price,"5 starts because item is just right when you really think about it.Sent on time and great customer service. Two of the four cases came cracked due to rough shipping and the seller sent a new set to me immediately, packaged very safely.As for the cases they are perfectly sized and are perfect for organizing rechargeable batteries. I had all my batteries in this drawer and it was a mess. This makes life incrementally easier. For the price of these things it is worth it.I never knew that as an adult getting little plastic cases to organize and store my rechargeable batteries would create such a deep satisfaction and fulfillment to my life. Not really sure what that means about my life. I'm glad I didn't foresee this, though.These things fit the batteries snugly. This means that if you jostle the little case or store it sideways or upside down it will not let the batteries get all messed up and out of place. It's made of thin plastic. It can crack if you are rough with it, but it won't crack by just throwing it into a drawer and using it. I guess you can find a thicker plastic or kevlar battery holder, but let's be serious...you don't want to spend too much money organizing batteries. This is pretty much the ideal battery holder because it holds them snug, it opens and closes easily, and it is not expensive.Added bonus tip: if the case cracks at all you can get a role of packing tape and pull off a piece about 2 or 3"" and use then to fix the case to better-than-before durability. See my pics of the case I hold in front of the purple tissue box of the case I repaired.",3372,703,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HFEVOE4

This one is the best of the bunch of the ~5 I bought. The rest are going back. Here‚Äôs what I found:The big issue with the clear acrylic ones is that there‚Äôs no locking mechanism, so get ready to be picking up batteries off the floor for an hour if you make a false move. They seem tailored to wall mounting / never moving from one place. If you have any other use case, that‚Äôs not the organizer for you.This one is portable, zips up, and even in transit the batteries stay organized / snug even when jostled quite a bit. The zipper is nice quality and the case is a hard case design (not military spec hard but padded more than a lot of laptop sleeves I‚Äôve seen out there).I also like the pockets which are handy for the occasional spare oddball battery. Batteries fit well, and with the foam you can kind of wiggle in some batteries of different sizes if you need to make room.My only changes to this design in a perfect world would be to have a sturdier battery insert instead of the foam it came with.... partly due to the tedious process of removing all the little foam inserts from the cutouts. Also, the foam makes that the area likely first to fail. But unless you‚Äôre using a battery organizer 24/7 365, which I‚Äôm assuming is not the case, that will be many years out. And, for this one‚Äôs strengths I can manage the 5-10 minutes pulling out all the little foam fellas.Given the nice features, reasonable price and the severe limitations of the rest of the competition this one is satisfying enough to put the subject to rest.",Good idea and possibly safer for battery storage,"I received this last week, so I may have to revise the ""durability"" rating in a year or so.The premise seems to be good. I have purchased holders before which go on the wall and they are just not durable (or the batteries fall out). Batteries can't fall out of this. It's zipped up and looks good. I'd like more D battery spaces, but that's not a deal-killer. There are a ton of AA and AAA spaces, and we do go through AAs, so that's good.Thoughts:The item is *heavy* once it's loaded. That makes sense. It doesn't include a battery tester and some people downgraded it for that. I didn't expect that it would, and my old Radio Shack tester fits in the space.I didn't realize I'd have to insert the batteries in prepunched foam holes, so there were a lot of ""hole innards"" to deal with. No biggie, but not expected.The main reason I finally cleaned out the ""battery bin"" is because I read that it is possible for batteries to cause fires under the right (wrong) conditions if they are randomly thrown in together. I'm sure it's exceedingly rare, but I didn't like how all my batteries were a mess. Now they are not. By the way, when I went through my batteries I discovered that I had purchased waaaay too many. This organizer makes it easy to see what is needed!",A battery organizer with plenty of space and pockets,"The battery case organizer is everything I was looking for. The case itself has a somewhat firm yet soft shell, if that makes sense. It is pretty sturdy and the zipper glides smoothly.The interior is roomy. It has pockets for miscellaneous things you want to put in there. There are also slots for the flat batteries next to the battery tester.The holder itself is made of foam which makes it easy to put in and remove the batteries. Holds the battery snugly and has plenty of slots!!The battery tester works great. The 9V is a little tricky to use but if you angle the battery right, you‚Äôll get a good voltage reading (as pictured).Very happy I spent a few extra bucks on this case versus buying the less priced plastic organizers. Well worth the price and saves my sanity in finding a full charged battery.",Looks like this will be a winner!,I had about 130 batteries in a box with dividers and it took me a while to pull the one I needed out as I kept them in smaller boxes that I had to open to get the size I wanted. This holder is perfect for me as I leave it in a closet and just lift the lid and easily pick out the battery I need. I did have to knock out all the sponge holes as others have mentioned - but I saved them and use them for various bumper applications as they are great for that (so for me a nice bonus). I am glad I bought this case and I also bought a battery tester at the same time that fits in perfectly.,I would recommend this... read why,"My reviews are my honest and genuine opinions. I am not sponsored in any way. I am passionate about providing honest reviews because there is too much ""sway"" out there to make an informed decision. My reviews are longer than many others' but this is just a result of me typing out my thoughts.This product arrived a day earlier than expected which was a nice surprise. My overall concerns after reading the reviews were the sturdiness of the case, the quality of the foam inserts, and general durability of the product. Even with these concerns, I decided to try this product and I am very pleased that I did.My Review by parts:The product was well packaged and upon first inspection, the case appeared to be very durable. Made from a hardened nylon case; like that of portable hard drive cases but with a smoother exterior, I am confident that knocks and bumps will not damage the contents of this case. The handle, stitching and zipper are sturdy and I don't expect any issues.The battery tester that was included is very basic but simple to use and functional. The battery tester is not ""high-end"" so I would expect that over time this may need to be replaced but at the same time, it is so ""basic"" that it should last a long time if properly cared after. I have seen similar if not the exact tester on Amazon for around $5. This should tell you a little about the type of product that comes with this case.The foam is very standard and what you would expect from any other product with a pre-cut foam insert. A previous review commented on the tedious nature of pushing out the foam plugs but this is standard. Just understand that ""some dis-assembly"" is required. Another review commented that the pre-cut plugs were not cut out fully so to be cautious of tears. This is a good rule of thumb with foam inserts. Never expect that everything will be fully cut, with this product or any other... unless the pre-cut / custom foam is a much more rigid foam (aka Gun Cases). It took me a full minute to ""carefully"" push everything out and my case fortunately had everything fully cut. Overall, the foam was not damaged and there were no unexpected cuts, tears, or deformities. I would expect that the foam to last with proper use.Overall, this is a good case. I decided on this verses the many other hard plastic cases with a lid because of the following considerations.1) When zipped, nothing will spill out. Other plastic cases do not always have a latch to secure them and if they do, it is to keep the lid closed as opposed to keeping the contents inside. This was a concern for me as I didn't want to be cleaning up accidental battery spills, especially since I only use rechargeable batteries.2) More durable case. I was concerned that other cases being constructed out of plastic, may crack with an accidental knock or bump, especially when heavier due to being full of batteries. A crack would drive me crazy so this case seemed more appropriate and at least more durable than a simple plastic case with a clear lid.3) As I mentioned before, I use rechargeable batteries so this case was an ideal solution. Because the interior of the lid has four pockets, I am able to insert my tiny ""Goal Zero"" charger for AA and AAA as well as other useful cables. The 9v charger doesn't fit but with AA and AAA, I have everything from a AA battery to a D Cell by using adapters.I hope that this review helps!",12739,2,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GSLW9CM

Smooth, rich cereal notes are brought to the fore by Guatemalan washed Arabica, which are then blended with Nicaraguan beans to create a strong, distinct flavor. tormio is mainly comprised of dark and long roasted beans, which help to develop its intensity, both in terms of body as well as singular notes. A long prewetting and high temperature allow to express the spicy and woody notes of Stormio.ODACIO: A long bold & lively coffee blend. Intensity 7. An audacious blend of fine Arabicas from Nicaragua and Ethiopia, Odacio is a full-bodied coffee with cereal notes accented by a slight East African fruitiness. Adding milk softens the flavor, bringing dairy, sweet notes. Fusing the flavors of two different continents, this blend of fine Arabica beans from Central America and East Africa serve up contrasting, yet complementary tastes in Odacio. MELOZIO: A smooth & balanced coffee blend. Intensity 6. Fine quality Brazilian Bourbon and Central American Arabicas are lightly roasted to create a rounded coffee that is smooth and perfectly balanced. Adding milk opens up the softer, sweeter sides of the coffee, enhancing the biscuity notes. Central American Arabica coffee delivers balance and a harmonious character to Melozio, which is enhanced by the sweet, honey notes of fine Brazilian Bourbon coffee beans. Thanks to the split-roasting, the fine Brazilian Bourbon beans reveal flavors rich in sweet cereal notes, giving a sensuous, smooth texture. The soft character and balance is achieved through the second split of Central American Arabicas. The fast flow and high temperature ensure a roundness of flavor, which is typical in blending lightly roasted Bourbon and Central American Arabicas.","{'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Product Dimensions': '11 x 3.5 x 7.5 inches; 7.8 Ounces', 'Item model number': 'COMINHKG115504', 'Manufacturer': 'Nespresso Pods', 'ASIN': 'B01N05APQY', 'Country of Origin': 'Switzerland', 'Domestic Shipping:': 'Currently, item can be shipped only within the U.S. and to APO/FPO addresses.

When I got my first Nespresso machine an original line unit I did try a few of the other brands but none of the knock off brands came close to the taste and quality of the Nespresso product. Even though I could save a few bucks using the knock off pods I came to the conclusion that using the Nespresso brand pods was cheaper than going to Brand ‚ÄúS‚Äù to get my coffee fix. Plus it was better for the environment since Nespresso has a recycling plan for its own pods which is easy to participate in unlike the knock off brands which are usually plastic thus not easy to recycle. With the Venturo machine there is no decision to be made the only pods that will work are made by Nespresso. Yes they cost a bit more than those for original line machines, but the brew they make is top quality!So, if like myself you enjoy good well made coffee I believe the investment in a Venturo machine is worth every penny spent!!",35724,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N05APQY

I've been doing it for a long time, and it's only recently that I've discovered that some of them are better than others. For instance, I've noticed that Ikea bookshelves have a little notch cut out of the back bottom to accommodate baseboards.But this piece here, this is now the crowning champion as far as I'm concerned. I do some carpentry in my spare time, and I really was able to appreciate the attention to detail that went into this shelf unit. Just as an example, the card stock backing that comes with virtually all shelves comes in this case with the veneer on *both* sides (most manufacturers leave one side blank as a cost-saving measure) and with pre-drilled holes that line up perfectly with the shelf so that you don't have to mark or guess where the shelf is.Parts are well-designed and typically only fit together one way: the correct way. That's a huge plus when you consider the number of times I've put a part in backward only to realize far later down the assembly process and have to take everything apart and then do it all over again correctly. Not with this item; things fit together smoothly.The instructions are great, with the screws being used for each step shown on the page actual size, so you can simply hold a screw up to the diagram and tell if it's the correct screw! Nice!And the ultimate test of a good kit: do they include extra screws? In this case, the answer is yes. I consider it the epitome of miserliness for kits to come with EXACTLY the right number of screws, because if you lose or damage one, you're (excuse the pun) screwed. This kit comes with a few extra of each screw/nail, so if you lose one, you're ok.Frankly, I wasn't looking to spend this much money on a shelf, but I'm glad I did, and feel I got a great value for the dollar. Quite frankly, other than using real wood instead of particle board, there isn't much room for improvement on this shelf!",Great bookshelf! Easy to follow assembly insructions.,"This bookshelf is exactly what I wanted for my living room reading nook. It was delivered on time, and the first thing I noticed was how well it was packaged to prevent damage during shipping.I decided to use this opportunity to teach my 11-year-old how to assemble furniture. We talked about the importance of reading and following the directions, and making sure we have everything we need before we begin. I compared it to a cooking recipe to help him understand why you need all the right parts, tools, and to do things in the right order.We took an inventory of the pieces that were in the box and familiarized ourselves with them. We gathered the required screwdriver and hammer. We cleared plenty of room on the living room floor. Then we read step 1.My intent had been to assemble the bookshelf with the assistance of my son. However, after working side by side with him through step 3, I stood back and let him do the vast majority of the assembly. Yes, a preteen was able to assemble this unit with only the occasional extra hand to line things up. It took him about 4 hours and I am pleased with the finished product.","Great shelves. Some damage, but good service.","I ordered 6 of these units as an alternative to built-in shelving for a room we are using as a library.3 out of the 6 units we received had a damaged ""M"" piece -- that's the rounded molding on either side of the open shelves. Two of them were entirely snapped in half within the box, and the third had been crushed such that its veneer was severely cracked. It was very easy, however, to order replacements for these parts via Sauder's website, no questions asked, and the replacements arrived within a few days. I had considered docking a star for the sheer rate of damaged units (50%, in my sample), but I think Sauder made it right so quickly and easily that they deserve their star back.The shelves themselves look fantastic. They are a little darker than we were expecting based on the pictures, but they are indeed a very dark cherry, with a slight red hue. We have them arranged in two rows of 3 on opposing walls, and they look very good side-by-side. They are able to sit flush next to each other because there is no top or bottom molding on the sides of each unit.The main material used is pressboard, and the moldings are little more than dense cardboard with a veneer, but you wouldn't know it to look at them. The assembled units are very sturdy, and we have each shelf entirely filled with books with no problem.Assembly wasn't bad; it was about average for ready-to-assemble furniture. Sauder's instructions are always accurate and easy to follow, and this was no exception. Almost all of the pieces, however, were missing their labels, and this made the first unit harder to assemble than it needed to be. With my second unit, I started using a drill to fasten wood screws, against Sauder's instructions. This sped up assembly a fair amount, but I wouldn't recommend it until you learn which screws may strip their holes, how tight they need to be, etc. The longest single part of assembly was hammering all the tacks into the backing. The most frustrating part was attaching and aligning the door hinges.Note there is a slight design flaw with the shelving. For the lower shelf in the top, open area, a bracket holding the front piece to the side piece blocks the shelf from being slid into place on its support pins. This means you have to hold the shelf in midair while you remove two of the pins, slide it into place, and replace the pins. Pretty annoying, but nothing major.",I was skeptical....but so happy we purchased,"Bought two of these along with the matching Palladia Credenza. They were for my mother who had very old Sauder furniture and loves the company. She insisted on replacing her old Sauder furniture with the same company.As I stated on my review of the matching credenza....Sauder has outstanding assembly directions. I have put together a few things in the past, but nothing had instructions as detailed and easy to understand as these furniture pieces. Each Library took about 2 hours to complete. (the first one took about 2.5 hours, the second one was easier since I was then familiar with the first assembly). Only needed a screwdriver and a hammer.One of the libraries came with a damaged wooden piece. I called Sauder and they had a new piece at my door in 2 days. No issues, and awesome customer service.Looks exactly as the pictures shown. Mom hates cherry colored wood....but this is more of a deep brown/cherry. With sun shining on it - perhaps a bit more cherry. But in the house, looks deep brown. Very rich, beautiful piece. We are pleased with the purchase.",They make it easy,"I read the reviews on this and other book cases and this one came out on top, so I ordered it. In fact, I ordered four of them on a Sunday and they all arrived on Wednesday!! There's video help on how to put it together on line and if you want, the Sauder website will email the instructions before delivery. The instructions are well laid out...but it will take time. I would say the average for the four cases was a bit over two hours for each. Once you've done one, it just gets easier. We took a seldom-used dining room and are in the process of turning it into a library-reading room. Great value for the money, and they look great. The next time I order furniture, I won't forget the Sauder name.",837,207,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007N7ZFK8

Nothing makes me more mad when I waste money unknowingly, and this is a case of that. So I would recommend getting a different brand. I actually bought an off brand when I bought this one and it still works fine, yet this one broke. Bad product.*****update‚Äî when i left this review an Anker representative contacted me the next day. They shipped me a new one and stated the other was likely a defect that was missed. I have been using the new one for a few days and it works great, no problems so far. Very satisfied with the customer service i provided.

So I would not buy this again because of the light let alone the fact it didn‚Äôt keep working.UPDATE: Once the company saw my review, they sent an e-mail to accept a free replacement of a slightly different model. This free model was almost 3X the price of the one I origionally bought. This company is serious about customer satisfaction! My origional product was past it's time to be returned, so they did not have to do anything for me. Once I confirmed I wanted the differnt charger, I had it within a couple days!

It is a bit on the large side, and it is quite hefty as well. The build is very solidI hope this was helpful to other perspective buyers!",Great little travel charger!,"I‚Äôll get it right out there ‚Äî I love Anker‚Äôs products. Each one always has a great build, works well, and does exactly what I need it to. I‚Äôd say that the PowerPort 2 Elite does all that.Now, one of the first things I noticed about this is that it‚Äôs a bit bigger than previous generations of the PowerPort 1 or 2. However, the plug is placed higher up on the body than before, so that means more space to plug something else into the outlet above. Another nice upgrade is that the folding plug is much easier to pull down than the old one ‚Äî a much needed improvement.Additionally, there was a design change to switch from a glossy finish to a matte finish. This way, it won‚Äôt scratch as easily, and personally, it just looks better.How about the actual functions of the wall plug? Well, the standout feature is Anker‚Äôs Power IQ and VoltageBoost. These technologies detect how much current is needed by the devices (aka an iPad needing more than an iPhone), and then deliver that needed power to the device. The technology is quite a bit more complicated than that, but the basic idea is that your device charges at its fastest possible speed. Except, however, for QuickCharge devices ‚Äî the PowerPort 2 Elite doesn‚Äôt support Qualcomm‚Äôs QuickCharge.Aside from that, there‚Äôs not too much to say about this wall plug. It charges up to two devices, at their fastest possible speeds. The build quality is excellent, and the heavier than normal weight adds to that. At the $13 price tag, it‚Äôs a pretty decent price too! If you‚Äôre looking for a great travel charger for your devices, then this is a good one to get.",Got a iPhone X? If so ....THIS IS YOUR CHARGER!,Hey Guys!!!! Well decided to go this route being Apple wants $35-$40 is bucks for a fast charger. We love our new iPhone X‚Äôs but the standard charger is a slow charger for the IPhone X‚Äôs which stinks!!!

However, my parents have owned bun for 30+ years and never had those problems so I leaned on that. The end results have been AMAZING with piping hot coffee every day. I've waited many years to own a Bunn and now that the below problems are resolved I am thrilled with it.I made sure I followed every preparation instruction to a T as to avoid plastic smells (read this in other reviews). That worked great, has never once smelled like plastic. I did however, experience daily overflowing of coffee grounds onto our counters. I was ready to return the Bunn and bust out the ol' trusty Mr. Coffee when instead decided to call Bunn Customer Service.Customer Service shared that due to the type of coffee I was using and the speed the water comes out of the sprayer, the coffee grounds were being pushed out of the top. (Makes sense, but I didn't spend $100+ on a coffee maker to clean up hot mess every day). In under 2 minutes of talking, she knew what I needed to correct the problem and sent it to me at no charge. I had it several days later and have NOT had 1 overflow of grounds since! (BLESS).The Solution: The solution was a different sprayer head that sprays the water into the filter basket more slowly. The brew time has been extended by maybe 1 min which doesn't bother me considering I am not cleaning up a massive mess every day.The Coffee: We use Dunkin Donuts mixed with Paramount Roasters. Pre-ground. Medium Roast. Customer Service shared that a finer ground or different type of coffee would correct the problem. I've used the same coffee for 4+ years and don't plan on changing but the new sprayer head resolved the issue anyway.","Performs as I expected, good buy","Man, I saw all the reviews about it tasting like plastic or whatever and they actually had me worried. On the left is the Bunn I bought in '07 and the right is the one I just got 12/18 and only got a new one bc after a decade it started to leak. Waited a month before I gave my review and it works great. Solid buy....again.","Started as disappointment, ended in love.","I got this Bunn coffee maker for my father (coffee addict) as a gift. This man knows his coffee, and even more he knows his coffee makers, like the back of his hand. But the day this was delivered, was the same day he got a COMMERCIAL Bunn coffee maker (like the huge heavy duty ones you see in restaurants) so needless to say, I was upset at him for ruining the surprise...and I ended up keeping this one for myself. And to be honest...I'm now happy it didn't go to him!A full pot brews within a matter of minutes. The back tank keeps the water at the ideal coffee temperature. And the best part of all....I save on coffee! I don't have to use nearly as much coffee grounds to make the perfect strength of smooth, black coffee.10/10 would definitely recommend this brand and model to every coffee lover I know.",Great coffee maker,"I tried the highly rated Cuisinart 14 cup, and then I returned it and bought this instead. I like that this machine seems to have good longevity. It's basic and simple and I don't need anything more. This machine at the very least serves as an always ready electric kettle for hot water if I decide to make tea or use my French press, but also makes a very good pot of coffee if I don't want to take the time for the other methods. I read many reviews about the coffee grounds overflowing and that did happen to me when making a pot of 10 cups and even 8 cups. So, I READ THE MANUAL and it states that if you use fine ground coffee or have soft water (which we do) you will need a different valve. They give you the # to call or the email and you can request one which they send you quickly for free. I installed mine and haven't had any more problems with overflowing. I would definitely recommend this coffee maker!",but I'm so glad I did,"Designed & Assembled in U.S.A.! This is written on the box. There are inaccurate reviews on here. You must read instructions before plugging in or you can ruin the machine and get that plastic smell that some complain about. I was nervous to spend this much on a simple coffee maker, but I'm so glad I did. A whole pot of coffee that tastes better than any other maker I've owned in two -three minutes. The water heater stays on all the time, and you simply fill the amount you want in the morning, which replaces the hot water that is now coffee. Just buy it, for you will be glad you did!!!

This thing is NOT as strong as compressed air. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs 90% of the way there with ZERO risk of freezing liquid spray effect. Comes with micro usb cable only, so find your own usb charging block (easy to find and cheap). It charges pretty fast (1 hour is about all I leave it on for) and it‚Äôs consistent once it speeds all the way up (speed up time does take a few seconds, just hold down the button and it will steadily go faster). In comparison for compressed you can maybe get consistent air pressure for maybe 30 seconds at best before they are empty. This thing goes too speed (almost as forceful as compressed air for a longgggggg time). $80 for virtually unlimited air. Buy it, it‚Äôs worth it.",Incredible power!,"Easy to set up, just take it out of the box, pop the nozzle end on, charge it with any USB charger you have around, and it just works! Hold down to have it blow until you let go. Tap twice to make it blow until you tap to shut it off. That's about all you need to know. No more having to buy canned air and frankly feel stupid about buying cans of air and throwing it into the garbage and chemicals coming out of it etc. Now you have something like a tire compressor but small and in your hand. It can work with the cord if you need to, but it's mostly meant to be charged and then used cordless. It's light and of course with no cord you can just pick it up and go anywhere! I'm using it to clean old phones--much too risky for antique circuits to wipe them with rags. But it will be great for my modern computer too--same deal, vacuum take dirt truly away, so do that first, but vacuum can't wipe off that gray film. So vacuum once, blast with this once, then vacuum on a final pass to get the extra stuff this makes come loose. Something to know rather than get mad about, it doesn't come with the actual wall part of the charger, just the cord. But to me that's good--I have lots of old chargers around where the item has long since died, so I'd just as soon not have to pay for a charger with newer devices I buy of any kind. If you do need the actual charger part, Amazon has some nice ones that I give people if I am, say, giving an item like this for a holiday present. You can also charge it from your computer, though that's slower than a wall charger. It also doesn't have all those strangely-shaped attachments, but I didn't want that--for example, a narrow nozzle or a wider nozzle that clips to it, which is going to blow dirt better--the narrow nozzle every time. For those that care, it's also very light, barely feel it, which means you can use it longer and get finer control. Price, sure, it costs more than a can of air, but it is full forever, so if you clean any significant amount you'll be ahead pretty soon, plus you don't sit there trying not to run out, you can just let it fly at things. I'm trying to think who else I know who could use this as a present because I'm sure it would be a hit with them too.",Just as good as Canned Air,"I'm so glad i bought this thing. Not only does it perform just as good as canned air for cleaning dusting out my computer but it's also well worth the money for the price compared to buying $30.00 of canned air and running the risk of spraying chemicals all over your equipment when tiling the can to get into those hard to reach places. Plus this doesn't freeze up and lose pressure when used for too long like regular canned air. Worth the money, and just as portable when needed.",Could be cheaper,"I hated spending so much money for this air duster, but I will eventually save money by not having to buy the canned dusters. This works well, and I'm enjoying being able to dust in all the nooks and crannies, knickknacks around my home. The air blows strong enough to dust but not enough to blow away small items. I use it for more than just the computer keyboard. It works well on that too.",Better than buying air cans,"This is a much better solution to buying non-refillable air cans. Sends out a stream of air as good as or better than an air can. Also, doesn't get freezing cold and stop working within 30 seconds like an air can either. Easily recharged using included USB cable. I work in I.T. and use it for blowing the dust out of computer cases and other peripherals. Pricey though but will pay for itself in a short time by not having to purchase air cans any more.

I always swapped the third one out for a yellow ink eraser for ink on mylar drawings, traditional to hand drafted architecture. To this day, I graduated college more than 5 years ago and I still use these on a regular basis.

I ordered a gel office seat that was hyped up during Amazon Prime day on promotion, the thing was like sitting on a rock! It GAVE butt ache. Next, I tried an intermediate cushion, some gel some foam - blah, and too thin, I could feel the chair and found myself standing rather than sitting just so as not to be on it. Now this one arrived today and I feel like Goldilocks, it's just right.The Pros: soft enough to sit on that does not make you sore, helps me in sitting up straighter without feeling like I'm ""perching"" on it, fits my office chair perfectly ( mines a usual size regular office-type bought at Staples) better than the gel one with the ""cut out"" U shape that made me feel I could spill over the sides if not centered right. I Have sat on a ""purple"" one at a store as I considered a ""purple"" but too expensive, and to my mind, this is every bit as good without the hefty price, in fact, it's better because it doesn't have that weird wobble I thought the purple one had. Maybe that's down to it having a cover (the store sample ""purple"" did not have a cover on). It does not squish down and I don't think it will, and for me, it's a keeper. The Cons: The box it arrived in had clearly been opened and I suspect someone else had returned it, came with no paperwork, cover already on ( maybe that's standard? for other two cushions the cover had come as separate in the box for me to insert and zip). But it doesn't matter if it's a ""return"" from someone else because quality is fine and I'm not returning. Another reviewer mentioned the smell and because I had read about it I smelled it - yes, it does have a chemical smell. But only if you put it up to your face, I'm sitting on it now and can't smell in usual use. Anyway, likely to wear off in time. I don't particularly like the feel of the ( cheap material) cover, so thin - on the other hand, same as the other cushions covers were, anyway I have wrapped it in a comfy small fleece blanket that the dog isn't using in his bed ( !) and this means it feels soft to sit on. Maybe that will affect the ""cooling"" that it's supposed to create through the eggbox airholes, but I didn't care about that feature, my office is cool, and needing air circulation in my cushion just isn't important to me - I wanted the support and comfort. I have sat on it for several hours today writing a long document and like it so much I will probably get some more for our kitchen chairs now we spend much longer around the family dinner table ( what with all the gourmet cooking we learned during COVID and better meals with appetizers etc that my fam. now regard as standard!). I Will update this review if doesn't hold up but my last one (a weak bit of foam bought on a whim in fabric store sale) was good enough for several years so I'm hoping it will provide years of comfort.For the price and the product, I wouldn't hesitate. It also says something that I came on and wrote a review because normally I don't bother unless particularly impressed or disappointed and I order quite a bit on Amazon ( not a paid reviewer or employee or anything).Good luck with finding the perfect one for you, I hope my views help with your decision, even though it's not an overly expensive item comfort can make a big difference to your office day so it's important to get it as right as you can.",My butt thanks me.,This seat cushion is fantastic! I have some wooden chairs in my game room and we sit in those things for about 4 hours when we have game night. I got 1 for me but now that I have got to use it I want to get one for each of my chairs for my friends. My butt is sooo happy now lol. The price is great. It stays firm yet soft. I'm a big boy and it still holds up to me. Very happy with this.,Amazing Gel Seat Cushion!,"+ Pros---------+ Lots of support+ Soft+ Cushiony+ Affordable+ Removable and washable cover for the cushion+ Holds its shape, doesn't decompress after long sessions+ Covers whole seat cushion-Cons--------------- Wish it was a bit thickerI bought this to alleviate tailbone pain from being seated 10-12 hours a day in my computer chair. I tested it out for 16 hours, and I experienced a lot less pain than if I were to sit in my chair without it. I have tried many seat cushions, and this one is definitely worth the price! I highly recommend this to someone looking for extra support for a newer or older computer chair. It might take a little bit to get used to as it's a little firm at first, but after the break-in period, it is amazing to sit on.",New Life for the Seat Cushion of a Not So Old Chair,"When I first tossed it on the chair, I was apprehensive, as to if it would do the trick. Days in, the apprehension was unfounded. This pad now feels like a ""not too much and not too little"" thing.Just got back from a four thousand mile drive to find myself suffering walking pneumonia. Subsequently, I found myself sitting a lot. The chair became uncomfortable and the discomfort just kept increasing. Towels and other things didn't soften the seat, so I gambled on this (Amazon, you screwed up getting rid of responses and such).I was happy to see this arrive in just a couple days. I tossed it on my chair and ""test drove"" it. The more it got used, the more I like it. My chair is ""habitable"" again.I suspect this cushion will last years longer than its cover. Accordingly, it would have been nice if it were black, instead of blue. Oh well, for the twenty bucks and a lot of satisfaction that came out of that expense, I'll suffer the future.","Big, comfortable","What a find! I don't know how I missed it the first time I shopped for seat cushions. It's big enough for our office chairs, our leather recliner, and our car seats. It's comfortable enough to sit for however long it takes to read the paper (we're old-fashioned and like our Sunday paper). Both my husband and I have what was once called piriformis syndrome but is most likely a variation of sciatica, so our butts and hamstrings get mighty uncomfortable while sitting. This cushion helps us tolerate longer sit times, but stretches do, too!",1802,708,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XX3W5KR

However, none of them are a combo and as trivial as that sounds, they take a lot of space, the broom is sometimes bigger than the dustpan, which is really not practical.I bought this broom and dustpan combo for many reasons:1) I like the bright orange color. It is very visible and make it easy to find.2) they fit perfectly behind a door without taking space. The combo is about the same size as the door know, so the doors can still open fully with the set behind the door (think storage in a closet)3) The dustpan, with the broom inside (for storage) can stand up easily. I never had an issue with them falling and pushing the door closed.4) The ""comb"" in the dustpan makes it very easy to clean the broom and remove anything without having to bend over and use my hands.In summary, I like the set and I recommend it.Note: If you like my review, please click on ""Helpful"".

I finally decided to be mindful of the environment and got this electric air duster.This is great since it's cordless so I don't have to worry about plugging in and have the freedom like the compressed air duster can.It's run by rechargeable battery so I feel good about the reusable energy source and that I can use this until the battery does not hold charge anymore, which will be for several years I'm assuming.It has two inter-changeable nozzles, which is great but I wish one of them has much thinner and had smaller opening so that it's comparable to the compressed air duster can's straw but it works well.It has 2 different speed and it also has flashlight option when working in the dark or tight spaces.It has the latest USB-C port and charging cable and it also comes with a storage case.Overall, I'm happy with this cordless air duster and I won't be buying the compressed gas air duster cans anymore. Hope this was useful... and if it was, please click on the helpful button below. Thank you!","Rechargeable, Cleans Tiny Crevices, Has Flashlight","I used to buy the canned air. It got expensive and ended up being cheaper to buy a new keyboard. So I started looking for alternatives and came across this air duster blower. It's on the smaller size, which is great for space, but it's also powerful. I wasn't sure how strong it would be being rechargeable. That's my favorite part, that I just simply charge it up and no more constantly buying canned air. One charge lasts about an hour. Even has a flashlight on it so I can see what I'm dusting. I don't just use it on our keyboards. So far I have also used it on vents around the house and in our vehicles. There are many more things we can use it on. Just a handy tool to have and I don't know how I have gone this long without one.",Cleans out the smallest crevices,"I had purchased the slime that cleans out small crevices before purchasing this duster and wish I hadn't. Not only was the slime a big hassle but it would actually get stuck and tear off inside of my keyboards. Not to mention, it claimed it would hold onto dust and other tidbits but it doesn't. I bought this duster in hopes it would clean out the slime in my keyboards and it did. The slime did end up hardening but got further stuck in between the keys. With this duster, it blew out those pieces. This duster is a lot stronger and powerful than those cans of compressed air that I've purchased but they don't leave that icy residue like those cans. Plus, I don't have to buy anything. When the battery dies, I just recharge it and done. However, I bought this about a month ago and charged it when it first came in. Since then, I've only had to charge it one other time and that is it. The battery life on this duster will last for a very good while. Plus, it doesn't just do keyboards. I've been able to use this in my car and along the windows to help get out dust my vacuum can't reach. The size is very similar to a handheld water gun. Makes cleaning so much easier, plus it saves on money too!",331,73,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VNHYX3P

Although I haven‚Äôt tried all the flavors, I did try the espresso and can tell you that it is the best. I switch between the flavors, roast strengths, and espresso. Some important things to mention is to not leave the packs in the machine when done. Also, do not store ‚Äúas is‚Äù for long periods of time and use filtered or distilled water so that the minerals don‚Äôt damage the machine.

This product is perfect for you if you love quality coffee with subtle flavor.The coffee is come out of the machine with a creme and the flavor enhances the taste, but it isn't overpowering. If you want to be slapped in the taste buds with artificial flavor, get a keurog and purchase flavored kcups.We normally drink virtuo pods black, but we found that these flavors are enhanced by a dash or two of milk and some sweetener.

BUT only after you figure it out a few finer details.,"SEE EDIT AT BOTTOM:We love this BUT only after you figure it out the finer details. My wife wants to scan all of our old photos pre-digital so I got her this to help with that mission (we have MANY photos). I have 3 scanners or all in ones in my house and I will say the Doxie Plus is the ONLY way to go for mass scanning images that are 8x10 or smaller. That is all you need to know on the positive and now I will address the issues I had. I am a techi so I assume this can be used without any reading but that is not he case.I did glance over documentation and see that it has built in memory but you can add more via the SD slot. So I grabbed a spare 64gb card and stuck it in there. It would not power on and stop blinking like it was supposed to. After digging I find out that it ONLY supports special SD cards (really!!!!) That is absolutely ridiculous, but there is actually plenty of built in memory.So I removed the SD card and it powers up fine. In the process of trying to figure out the bootup problem (having standard SD card in slot), I tried to locate a ""Calibration PDF"" on their website. This is the sheet you run through the scanner to calibrate it. Can you believe they make you buy that if you lose it! Another blunder in my opinion. My wife had the calibration page but I am letting you know so if you buy a used one you better make sure the calibration card is in there or your will have to buy another one if the calibration is ever needed again (not sure why you would but just letting you know).Once the scanner is turned on the light is green (300 dpi scan). If you press the button again, it goes to Orange which is 600dpi. They should have a simple sticker above the power button telling you this but they don't and they should allow you to set a default setting which they don't.We are doing photos so we did the scans at 600 dpi which still went plenty fast enough. 300dpi is REALLY fast (ie for documents).After you scan all of your photos, you have to open the software to import the scanned photos. BUT, when you click on the ""Import"" button in top right corner, it has not completed the import process. After you select all the images on the screen, you have to click on the SAVE button down below actually save them to your local drive. Why they do not allow you to just click the import and have the save process as part of that I do not know. It is just one extra step you have to do to save the photos.But even with these problem I still give this thing 5 stars. My wife is having to use our Epson 7510 for the larger pictures and ones already in the scrap book. The speed and ease of using the Doxie Plus is outstanding. I am sure this product is like everything. The folks who design it and package it, and write the manuals, etc, never actually use it so they have no idea on the simple and stupid mistakes they make.Bottom line, buy one, you will be glad you did :)-----------------------------------------------EDIT 05-19-20151) The Doxie does allow the use of SD cards up to 32GB. And it should be formatted in FAT32. They are considering putting a sticker or some other means of letting customers know that 32GB is the max. In my opinion it might be easier and more effective to update the firmware to allow for much larger SD cards since these are the norm, not the exception in 2015.2) After doing some extensive scanning of not only photos, but documents (ie medical records), it is evident that the saving process designed by Doxie is most ideal. We scanned many photos and documents and the documents we saved as PDF's where the photos were saved as JPG's. Also, the photos were separated by child and year. So I found my original thought on this to be a little misguided.3) Doxie has stated that the calibration card has to be the original printed card. It is a heavier card stock and printing on a 8x11 sheet of paper would not work. You can contact them about getting a Calibration card if yours is missing.I take pride in offering detailed and accurate reviews so I wanted to clarify these issues. But nothing changes on the fact that this device is an awesome little scanner and I am sure you will be happy with it.",Ready to work right out of the box.,"My main goal for this thing is to digitize boxes of old photos that I've accumulated. I have two flatbed scanners, but they take too long. I have many hundreds of photos to deal with.I read the included quick setup guide, enabled the battery, and put the Doxie on a regular USB phone charger cable. It took about 2 hours to charge, then it was ready to rock. This thing comes with an 8GB SD card, and that the one I used. It's already formatted--just plug it into the Doxie. Everything you need to get started is in the box. You don't need to buy anything extra. But DO fully charge it first and DO read the quick setup card before you do anything. The instructions are brief & simple, but important.There's no software in the box. From the Doxie website I downloaded the Windows10 .exe file for it and it works fine on my ancient HP desktop computer. The software is a combination file importer / photo editor / organizer. It is simple to use and doesn't require any explanation. It is also optional. The Doxie saves everythng as a JPG image file so you really don't need any special software. If you scan in a document and wish to save it as a PDF file, the Doxie software will convert it for you. There are many ways to save a JPG as a PDF, so again--the Doxie software is optional. The software is for Windows10 or mac only. If you are a Linux user, it's not a problem. Just transfer the scanned JPG images from the Doxie SD card to your computer. I used a universal card reader with a USB-A plug on one end. LibreOffice Draw can convert a JPG into a PDF for you even quicker than the Doxie software.Photo quality seems on-par with my Kodak and HP all-in-one desktop scanners, only the scan rate is MUCH faster. At 600dpi resolution, a photo only takes about 3 seconds to scan. I have a fat box of old photos that's been gathering dust for years. I fed them all through the Doxie in about 10 minutes! So 50 pictures down, and a few hundred more to go.So far I'm very satisfied with the Doxie. I'm making really good progress on my photo rescue project. I have noticed when the Doxie needs cleaning, I start seeing a line or two vertically across the image. It's not a big problem though. There's a cleaning cloth included in the box.I scanned the same old 35mm photo on 3 different devices for comparison. The Kodak and HP scanners are flatbed types included with an all-in-one printer/scanner/copier. All images are un-retouched JPG using the default settings at 600 dots-per-inch. The scans are of comparable quality. The difference is the Doxie will fit in my glovebox, requires no computer or cable, and scans a photo in about 3 seconds.Fun, useful, and very portable gadget. I'm glad I bought it.",I love this thing,"I was initially skeptical about buying a portable scanner for $178, but I've been trying to clean up the clutter in my life and paper is one of them. I also scan all my receipts from every purchase I make and keep track of my spending in a tracker so that I have a clearer understanding of where my money is going each month. I was originally scanning everything with my HP printer, but it was getting to be a real chore. I'd have to sit at my desk and put each paper through the scanner (which was LOUD and slow), then crop it, name it, and save it. It was mind-numbingly boring. I decided to take a chance and purchase the Doxie Go SE and I'm so happy I did!Now I can sit comfortably at my couch with Hulu or Netflix on and scan away. The scans go through the Doxie quickly and quietly and get sent to an SD card (like the ones we used to put inside digital cameras before smartphones took over), which is included in the package. Perhaps my favorite thing about the Doxie is that it auto-detects the size of what is being scanned. I'm able to go from scanning 8.5x11 papers to the small receipts from gas pumps to a standard sized receipt from Wegmans without having to crop ANY of it. It's one of those things you don't appreciate till you don't have to do it anymore!Then when I am done scanning, I pop the SD card out, put it in my laptop, and the Doxie software imports the scans. Another one of my favorite things about the Doxie software is that after each image is imported to your computer, it is automatically deleted from the SD card! So I don't have to worry about clearing the SD card myself or having the same files imported the next time I use the scanner.The Doxie software is pretty easy to use, although I'm pretty good with computers so I'm not able to speak to its ease of use for those who aren't as comfortable with PCs. I use the software to name all the files, crop them if I need to, rotate them if necessary, and ""staple"" pages together. I have noticed that when stapling a lot of pages together (such as the product manual for my expensive electronic toothbrush) the software can freeze sometimes, but it always unfreezes eventually. It's a very small hiccup in an otherwise incredible product.You can then choose to save files to your computer as a JPEG or PDF, or upload to a cloud storage service. I've been saving to my PC since I upload my receipts to my tracking software so I can't comment on the process of uploading to the cloud. Another great feature about the Doxie software is that when you save a scan to your computer, a green checkmark shows up on the scan so you know it has been saved and that you can delete it from the Doxie software. (Doing so just deletes it from Doxie, not from your computer.) This is nice so you avoid wasting time on trying to save scans that you've already saved to your PC but forgot about (helpful when I was scanning an entire month's receipts the other night). If you haven't already saved the scan, there's no checkmark and Doxie will warn you that it isn't scanned before you delete it.Charging time was quick. Doxie comes with a USB cable but no outlet adapter to plug it in to. You can charge it by plugging it into a USB port on your computer, or if you have owned a smartphone at any time, odds are you have a few outlet adapters lying around anyway. You can plug the USB cable into one of those and charge Doxie through a standard outlet.I would have liked to see the Doxie available in a few colors other than white. Most of my office accessories are black, and it would have been nice to have some fun color options like blue, purple, etc.I can't believe the longest and most passionate review I've ever written on Amazon is about a portable scanner. That should speak to A) how much I am type A and like organization, and B) how easy to use and high quality this scanner is. I'm so happy I bought this scanner and believe I will be using it for years to come. And when this one dies or becomes totally outdated, I'll keep buying Doxie scanners as long as the company is making them!","As good as a flatbed scanner, and so easy if you want to save family photos and documents to reprint, later","This scanner has been a lifesaver. I had a huge box of family photos to scan, and using a flatbed scanner was taking forever. The Doxie Go Plus can scan my photos in 1/4 the time (usually far less), and the results are just as good -- and sometimes better -- than my flatbed scanner. The results are excellent, with great resolution and clarity so any photo can be printed on demand with no loss of quality.If you've been meaning to start scanning and saving family photos or records, get this scanner. You'll be glad you did. It's an excellent value.Here are some more details from my experience with Doxie Go Plus: I bought this scanner, hoping it would scan clearly and easily. It's exceeded my expectations. I can sit in front of the TV and feed photos and papers through while I watch movies and shows. Even if I feed the photos through unevenly, the scanner handles it well, even correcting minor issues as needed.The scanner works quietly, is fast to charge, and very easy to clean after every 50 to 100 photos. (To clean out any residue or dust build-up, I just run a small, cloth-covered wedge -- provided with the scanner -- through the feed slot. I don't have to open anything. The process takes one second. Really.)I went through the entire box of photos -- hundreds of them -- in an afternoon. I had no problem feeding in thin, Polaroid photos as well as late 19th-century photos mounted on cardboard. I even scanned some photos on metal plates, and the results were superb.The scanned quality was just as good as my flatbed scanner. And, I have the option of scanning at 300 dpi or 600 dpi.Since using this scanner for that project, I've used it to scan my own drawings, my receipts, and old notes and bits of paper I might need to look at again, later. Everything went through smoothly and the results were consistently good.Though I've used the scanner a lot in the past month or so, it's still working as well as when it arrived from Amazon. I have absolutely no complaints about it, and can't think of anything negative to say.This scanner has completely changed how I deal with paper clutter, and it's small enough to throw into a backpack for research trips or business travel. I wish I'd had this years ago. I'm sure I wouldn't have as many storage boxes -- the ""I might need this someday"" kind -- if I could have scanned everything and let go of the actual paper.And, since I bought it for family photos (genealogy and general family memories), I'm able to share digital copies with my entire family, easily. No more worries about wonderful photographic images being lost or damaged!",OUTSTANDING! (Updated after 4 years of use),"Updated review after 4+ years of use:Bought the original Go with WiFi in 2017 (see review below). Have scanned thousands of documents/pictures without issue. Recently, the scanner started to jamb. I sent a support request describing my issue. II got a response the same day, and after a few diagnostic questions, they offered to send a replacement. I got the replacement in less than 5 days! The replacement not only worked perfectly out of the box, they sent the updated SE WiFi model! Unbelievable support for and incredible product. This company is the best.Original review:I have to say, I am impressed. I have used it for 1 day (approx 100 scans), and it seems to be everything it was advertised to be.Right out of the box, this feels like a premium product (as the cost dictated), the packaging, packing and documentation are all top notch. The device itself is solid, the build quality is quite apparent (no pun intended!) just by holding it and upon close inspection.I followed the quick start guide and scanned a photo in less than 3 minutes from opening the box.The device accepts the media quite easily and quickly scans it. I tried some mangled receipts from my wallet, and it handled them well. You do have to make sure the front edge of the document is clean, for some really badly mangled receipts, I just folded the top back against itself to create a clean edge, and the scan worked just fine (no jamming). The scan quality was better than that of my Epson XP-410, and certainly faster.The software setup was easy (an the online documentation is very thorough. The software is basically a tool to pull the scanned documents from the scanner. It provides some nice features to edit the scanned document and allow for some smart tagging (date/time). The OCR functionality worked better than I thought, even on some really faded poor quality receipts. I guess if there was one option missing, it would be the ability to automatically pull the scans from Doxie (or push from Doxie). There is the ability to manually save the scans to cloud services, I tried the Google Drive function, and it worked flawlessly.WiFi setup was a bit complex if you don't use the default configuration. By default WiFi is configured as a host at 192.168.1.100 as its own network (PC -> Doxie direct, bypassing existing wireless router). So if you have an existing wireless router and it is on the 192.168.1.x subnet, you may have a conflict if another device on your network already has a 192.168.1.100 address. If you follow the instructions, it is possible to add a connection to access it over existing router network, but if you follow the instructions carefully and I recommend that you have your computer connected both via wireless router WiFi and hard wired via Ethernet cable during WIFi setup.Overall, this is a great product. I will be using it every day, so I will report back on reliability if it becomes an issue.Pros:Solid, High quality in every aspectQuick scanning with very good qualitySimple yet elegant SW interfaceCons:WiFi Setup (relative to everything else) was a bit complex. But this is a one time thing, and it really was not bad as long as you follow instructions.Update 4/22/02 - This thing is a tank. Powers thru scans like hot knife through butter. Use it everyday, and works like a charm. One of the best purchases I have made on Amazon.",3114,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073H7V4DM

Beach Cruiser Trike. Pedal 3-Wheel Bike,$429.00,Love My Trike!,"I've been looking for a long time to find something I can ride on the nature trail close to my house. I'm 55, fat, lazy, and a weakling. I also have a balance disorder that won't allow me to use a two-wheeled velocipede. I've purchased and returned several vehicles that looked like great fun and great exercise, but were too hard to pedal or otherwise make them move. I was quite discouraged. Other recumbent trikes caught my eye, but they were too pricey.I took delivery of the Mobo Triton Pro in early February, and it sat in its box in my foyer while winter continued to rage on. We finally had relief from it just this past week. My son assembled my trike (the Youtube video is very helpful!) yesterday and it went back to the foyer to wait out the rain. :-PToday the sun finally peeked out between the clouds and the temperature was perfect! So I took the trike out to my driveway for its maiden voyage. OH MY GOODNESS, I'm so excited and happy! It rides smoothly, the seat is comfortable, I can pedal just fine, and the trike manages the slight slope of my driveway very well. Steering became intuitive quickly (I'm a klutz) and the brakes work great. The turn radius is really wide, which might bother some, but I should be fine on the trail, which is pretty straight and level. the trike doesn't pedal in reverse, but I learned a 3-point turn which let me turn around at the base of the driveway and pedal back up to the street. I just put my feet on the ground as needed and pushed myself backward. No problemo!I made probably ten laps that way, to get the feel of pedaling and steering, and I can't wait to take it out on the trail! I can tell already it's going to be so much fun and get me in shape this summer! I was panting when I sat down after just the short time I'd been riding, and my thighs and shoulders are a bit achy LOL!I had been concerned that I wouldn't get much of a workout in my upper body, but I can tell steering and breaking are going to get my arms working quite a bit, too.I can't rave about the Mobo Triton Pro enough! It's going to get this sedentary old lady in shape and keep her active into her ""golden"" years! I highly recommend this vehicle for anyone, but particularly those of us getting older and wanting to get, or stay, active and have fun doing it!",Comfortable and relaxed ride,"I purchased this trike for cruising around the neighborhood with my daughters. With only one speed it is limited in function. Top speed is about the same as a brisk jog so it is not fast. However, it is close to the ground so it feels fast even if I'm just keeping up with my daughter. Seems like the perfect speed for walking a dog. Climbing is fine. I keep the tires pumped up to 40psi and haven't had any issues with traction that other reviews have mentioned. Padded cushions are comfortable. They are similar to what you find on workout equipment. Being in a seated position, there's no strain on the back/hands like a normal bike. The frame is adjustable and feels sturdy enough. Lastly, the instructions were clear and took me about a hour to put together. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and it serves its purpose well.",The perfect transportation for us octagenarians,"Superior product with excellent engineering. When I looked at some of the criticisms I was reluctant to buy. I made all the mistakes published in the reviews. Then I went back and REALLY read the instructions. All problems corrected rides perfectly. I additional tip. Be sure to use loctite on EVERY threaded part you assemble. Solves all problems. When assembling fenders, loctite the shaft and HOLD the fender in alignment while tightening the nut.",What a gift for kids/adults with balance issues,"Our son has muscle strength issues on one side of his body. Regular bike without training wheels was not really an option and at his age, training wheels and kids =not so nice comments. This trike is such a relief and such a gift! He loves it, it‚Äôs so easy to assemble and is perfect for cruising around. Thank you Mobo!",Great dog walking vehicle.,"Me at 75 years old, this one speed entry level trike has several advantages over more espensive recumbents.Price. Most entry level recumbent trikes start at 1300 dollars. I bought this on amazon for 345 dollars.Short crank length for those with limited of range of motion. Your knee doesn't end up in your chest with every crank. I have a recent hip replacement. Low profile. Low seating. No tilt or tipping problems. You are low to the ground. Impossible to fall off this machine! Actually safer than walking. Ease of assembly. No chain assembly. Very simple instructions. Perfect for dog walking. Ideal speed. After going six blocks I can feel the burn. Good exercise. Advertising is very accurate it is made for level ground. My dog knows when I'm even just thinking about a ride. There she is.",1095,268,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VGFN7K

Nothing against Pelican, but money doesn‚Äôt grow on trees. I actually couldn‚Äôt be happier with my choice in my travel case choice! When any latch is thrown on this case, it ‚Äúsnaps to‚Äù with motivation and intensity. The foam is dense but cuts easily enough for fine adjustments. I used a fine tooth saw for the longer cuts. I also bought extra foam inserts so I can just change the insert to travel with different rifles/pistols/ammunition boxes. Great setup, couldn‚Äôt be happier!",The only foam to concider.,This foam is not described very well. Not only is this a high density closed cell foam but also several 1/2‚Äù layers of this foam that have been glued together. Where this is useful is when you need to cut a hole that is 1/2‚Äù deep you can set your knife to a 1/2‚Äù and peel out one layer. This foam is also considerably easier to cut as a result of its firm structure.,Improvement over flimsy pluck foam,"This is 4 layers of sturdy foam heat-linked together to form a thick and cushioning bed for your firearms or camera equipment, etc. The foam cuts easily with a sharp knife and will last for years without disintegrating and dusting up all your gear. Place softer foam below, and egg crate foam above to hug your firearms in place.",Good stuff but. Dont use a hot knife.,"Great stuff. But to cut. Use an electric cutting knife. Like one uses on thanksgiving. I tried a hot knife and its messy. After what felt like an hour with one whole, i looked on YouTube. So tried it. It went super fast from their. I‚Äôm using it for stage lights and probably did not leave enough space between. I‚Äôm sure for of you crazy people with semi automatic weapons which i 100 percent do not approve on, it will work great. Just dont use a hot knife.",Works well for supporting medical scanner testing objects,"I needed a material that was easy to shape, sturdy and as close to radiographically transparent as possible for making fixtures to support so-called ""phantoms"" for testing PET scanners and gamma cameras. Some of these phantoms can weigh 40 pounds. This foam meets that need. It is only faintly visible in CT topograms and does not measurably attenuate either 140 keV or 511 keV gamma rays. I make coarse cuts with an insulation knife and final, fine cuts using a scroll saw with a blade that has teeth that cut on both the up-stroke and the down-stroke of the saw. Other reviewers are correct that this foam is slightly thicker than 2 inches, but that is not a problem in my application.",647,100,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015JRXH1W

I've been using a solid laptop desk and my machine was getting way too hot (you should have seen all the stuff I was putting under the laptop, trying to prop it up to get ventilation). My laptop now sits on the cooling pad, that is sitting on the solid laptop desk, that is sitting on my lap....I know that sounds cumbersome, but it works great (btw, both the cooling pad and the desk are extremely lightweight). The cooling pad has leg extensions that makes it slant (but not too steep) and my laptop does not slide and is actually a better angle (I can even see the keyboard better). The fans are quiet; I am aware of them, but they don't bother me and best of all, my machine doesn't even feel warm after being on for an hour! I'm so pleased this works!!! [Note: there are 2 plastic ""baffles"" (flaps) at the front you can pull up that will prevent your machine from sliding down...I learned this from reading the enclosed leaflet...go figure]",What a surprise!!!,"I do not understand why people gave such few stars on this laptop cooler. This product is excellent. I really recommend to anyone who has old laptop that shuts off due to overheating issue. My 12 inch laptop has an issue with overheating when I play high-end games. Since I have this laptop cooler, I have no more overheating issue. In fact, the performance of my laptop kind of increased I guess. Two things I need to point out on this product are,1. the material of the body does seem good quality, however those six fans are silent and seemed good quality (adjustable speed).2. I do not think this product can hold 17 inch laptop (up to 15.5 inch) as the manufacture claims.After all, this is a good product and affordable, worthy to have.","Economical, effective, and protected (See detailed analysis)","I bought this laptop fan April 2020, since my 2010 MacBook Pro always heated up A LOT as I watched Youtube or used Zoom. One time, I almost got a blister on my finger from touching the vent opening (I never did that again without running the laptop fan). I‚Äôve been using it basically every day since then, and it has greatly reduced the temperature of my laptop, even when running the most demanding applications. The laptop‚Äôs no longer HOT, but warm.Here‚Äôs why I would recommend getting any computer fan:1. Scientifically, it makes sense: moving air is up to 200x more effective at dissipating heat than still air. (According to the Convective¬†Heat Transfer Coefficient¬†‚Äúh‚Äù)2. You don‚Äôt want to burn your finger like I did.3. Cooling the laptop boosts performance and preserves laptop battery life. Permanently damaging the laptop battery through overheating would be un-ideal.Here‚Äôs why I would recommend getting the LiangStar computer cooling pad (this specific one):1. It‚Äôs one of the most economical choices on Amazon for six fans (which is good because those six fans cover the entire bottom area of the laptop). Go ahead, look around. See if you can save more money on any other option with six fans.2. It works well. This may be a non-unique reason, but it does exactly what it‚Äôs supposed to. See other reviews for the details of exactly what works well.3. It‚Äôs risk-free. After several months of punishingly demanding use, I experienced some problems with some of the fans, so I contacted the seller, and he was very quick and friendly in responding. The issue was completely resolved within a couple email exchanges, and everything was covered under the 1-year warranty.In summary, though there may be many laptop cooling pads out there, this is the one I bought, and I‚Äôm satisfied with my choice because this laptop cooling pad is economical, effective, and protected (under the seller‚Äôs warranty).",Best one.,"Quiet and does exactly as I anticipated it to do.Not a bad investment for older computers that overheat or a $2800 Razer Gaming Laptop that gets HOT.I've tried 4, this is the best yet.",A must have for older laptops,"Works great!

I've used it practically everyday since its delivery, and have put it through varying extensive situations. Needless to say, this backpack has served me incredibly well throughout its usage period, as this review will tell.5/5 | Appearance:This backpack is undoubtedly one of the much better-looking backpacks available for purchase in the market right now. The design of the backpack provides both a sleek and professional appearance, which certainly outdoes its competitors and relatively cheap pricing. Nothing else really to say past that, just simply that the bag has an incredible appearance.5/5 | Storage:There have been various moments where I've had to carry up to three heavy textbooks, three notebooks, and various tools within this backpack, and needless to say, it has certainly stood capable of withstanding and storing these heavy objects. The storage capabilities are incredibly impressive and always serve me well.4/5 | DurabilityAs previously mentioned, this backpack has gone through an absolute stockpile of situations in which its durability has been tested. For the most part, it has served well in staying both usable and undamaged, but there are certainly some questionable durability issues. For one, only a week after receiving the backpack, the black coating on the exterior USB port came off in certain parts, which, though not a major deal, still definitely sucks. Outside of that, theres only been one other problem and that's with one of the exterior zippers not being able to zip up, which seems to be because the bag's own interior material is captured within the zipper. Definitely still impressive in terms of durability, but it could ultimately be slightly better.5/5 | Water ResistanceIt has rained numerous times on this backpack, and yet each time, everything within the backpack has stayed perfectly dry! The water resistance material is certainly one of the best that I've seen ever be used on a bag. I mean, it could literally be pouring down rain and soak both you and the backpack, and yet nothing inside will be wet at all! Incredible water resistance.Anyway, you get the point, it's an incredible backpack with excellent looks, storage, durability and water resistance. Great choice for anybody in search of a backpack.",Really good looking and sturdy bag with a SMART layout,"I‚Äôm so impressed at the quality of this bag. I got the three pocket version and was actually seriously surprised by how much more useful it was. Very sturdy, great feeling materials, EXCELLENT design and layout, and looks really great! All of the zippers are very sturdy and of good quality and the fabric around the zips feels extra tough so I don‚Äôt have to worry about a pocket breaking and ruining the whole bag. The shoulder straps are very comfortable and padded; the back of the bag has quarter inch padding for your shoulder blades and lower back as well. The smaller adjustable straps that connect the bag to the shoulder straps fee extra tough and are secured very nicely to the bag itself. I‚Äôm definitely not going to have to worry about zippers or straps breaking on me. The layout of the bag is really smart. The big pocket opening so deep and folding forward means you can really pack the bag up with a lot of stuff and access what you have on the bottom without having to unload everything else! This has made such a huge difference for me. I use this bag for work where I‚Äôm a security officer and it lets me stash all of my equipment, jackets, hat etc in a smart ergonomic way. The other smaller pouches inside the bag feel solid and secure and are stitched nicely to the bag. I haven‚Äôt been rained on too hard yet while using the bag but I can tell just by the material texture and fabrics that it‚Äôs going to be a solid performer when it comes to water resistance! I love the sleek tidy and professional look of the bag. Very thrilled with it. More than worth the money.",Best overnight bag I could find on Amazon!,"I searched all the bags out there and found the one that would be stylish, functional, and economical. I bought this bag for a 24 trip to Seattle for a buddy's wedding. I was able to fit my fancy clothes, shoes, and everything else I needed for the trip. I currently use the bag for work for my laptop and chargers. You won't be sorry.*People have complained about the structure of the bag. It's not a hard shell so expect it to be floppy at times if the bag is not full. Common sense.",Perfect for my needs,"I got this bag for work as I was tired of the typical shoulder bag. The laptop section has roo. For my 17"" workstation, second display, amd ipad pro.the Next section has my folio, power cord, mouse, mouse pad, and any other files I need to carry. The front hold cables and anything else. I love the little pouch at the top, perfect for pencils, pens, highlighter, and stapler. The only thing I do t like is the zipper for the front doesn't allow full open access, more of reach in and hope you can get what you want. Not a huge hang up as there are several pockets to utilize. I was searching for a while for a bag and thought I'd take a chance. Glad I found this bag. The material feels rubberized and I fear that this will start to crack and peel as time goes by. As a CPA, this checks all my boxes for client visits and bring stuff for home for remote home without having to carry a second bag.","Bought for a trip, love it! But..","Love this bag, has so many pockets. Zippers are super smooth. Has a place for a laptop, able to fit 2, a place for an ipad and the usb dongle which was cool on the trip, i could keep my battery pack inside and just have the cord plugged in. Seems durable so far had about a month as of this review, use it everyday. Now the couple problems.. the biggest problem is the water bottle holder, they need to revise it in the future, its not stretchy and way to small, u can fit a bottled water but thats it, no work out bottle, none of those thicker gatorade bottles, its the only big let down for me and it is super annoying if u have a reusable water bottle‚Ä¶ the other thing is i wish it had a dedicated pocket on the side for the portable charger that u could zip up with the cord so it was out of the way on the inside and maybe another on the outside where you could shove the cord from ur phone after ur done. And last the material is very nice, looks fancy for a book bag, but it shows marks very easily from like dirty water or what ever.. So anyway a great book bag, would defiantly recommend but could use some revision to be perfect.",618,88,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085Q5N7TH

Read reviews on this maker and another, very different dual purpose maker. Based upon the reviews to some degree I went with this one. It works great. The negative reviews about smells, messy grounds, etc. now appear to be ""fake reviews"" to me. There is no smell and the coffee making process is very neat and very good. The grounds that the water passes through look like the process occurred perfectly using (to date) three different ground types. I literally have lost confidence in the review process, but this one is accurate, I promise you.",The best coffee maker on the planet,"This review is legit!!! After reading some of these, I wonder what coffee pot they are reviewing and then wondering if competitors are buying this pot just so they can leave a negative review. Plastic smell??? there is none. Tank is plastic, no it is stainless steel. I am on my 3rd bunn and only replaced my 10 year old pot because I thought the tank might be corroded with our hard water and I have never done the tank cleaning process. I love the carafe style, I kept my old carafe, I make two pots in the morning, fill my and my girlfriend cup up, pour the rest in old carafe and make another pot. Works great looks amazing!! You have a negative comment on this pot, you are wrong. Only thing I can see is if one stopped working but I am sure that is rare. I buy on amazon a lot and hardly leave feedback but this pot deserves it considering like what someone else said ""Fake News"" comments",Very pleased with this coffee maker. Up-Star from 4 to 5.,"I was first attracted to this particular Bunn coffee maker because the logo is a subtle, embossed sign rather than the glaring BUNN logo glaring from the front of the machine. Aesthetics was important to me.The 'burning plastic' smell that was reported by some reviewers does not exist in this machine.Coffee tastes very good, and is made surprisingly fast. I have yet to get used to the speed. There's no pause feature necessary to pour mid-brew since it really is that fast.The double wall stainless steel carafe is excellent. It keeps coffee hot longer than the 2-1/2 hour product description states.I paid attention to the reviews that complained that coffee ended up all over the place and made a mess. I made sure to buy the Bunn coffee filters and the Bunn re-usable filter. So, absolutely no problems there.I gave it 4 stars since I've only had it for a short time. Will review again a year from now.I know I said '1 year', but decided to revisit my review of this machine.Almost 4 months later, I still have no complaints, especially none of the problems other reviewers have had. I still get very hot coffee, the thermal pot keeps it very hot for at least a few hours and hot enough for another few hours. If I'm desperate, the coffee is at least warm at the end of the day. :-)No plastic burning smell, and coffee grinds have NEVER overflowed and made a mess. Again, I stress that I use coffee filters especially for BUNN machines. I use premium coffee beans that I grind with a Capresso Burr grinder or ground coffee as the same brand of beans, if it makes a difference to anyone.***Update again. Machine still performing very well. The only different thing I tried and it works, is to put a timer on the plug, since I really only make coffee once a day. When I have guests staying over, I just turn off the timer in case we need to make coffee throughout the day.",FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SET UP,"I had read MULTIPLE reviews about a ‚Äúhorrible plastic odor‚Äù, which literally had me rethinking my purchase. However, it rationally and calmly began reading more reviews and found the LOGICAL ones. I received my coffeemaker a day early, set it up the next morning FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE MANUAL. Works wonderfully and no odor.",Best coffee maker EVER!,My old Bunn of over 10 years had a slight leak so we needed to replace it. (Only another Bunn would do- they are the best)This new one with a thermal carafe instead of the heat plate on a glass pot works so much better. Keeps the coffee warm for 2 to 3+ hours without burning the coffee.Highly recommend,4252,759,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GY6PHYZ

These are pretty much a classic folding metal chair. They seem sturdy and work smoothly and can be tucked into a small space or easily hung on a wall. For being painted steel with no padding, they are actually pretty comfortable! I can't speak for the ""antique linen"" version, but the black chairs are painted with a textured paint rather than a gloss. I kind of like it! Time will tell how well it holds up, but it looks pretty tough.One thing I will mention, 2 of the 4 chairs had small dents right out of an undamaged box - but these are really more for sitting on than looking at, and I'm sure there will be more dents to come.Something to note - if used outdoors, the black chairs get VERY hot in the sun",Just what I need for additional seating.,"I ordered these for when we need additional seating that is functional and durable.They are all metal, built sturdy and securely. There is no padding, so if you want a padded seat, these are not the ones for you. I don't need that so these were just what I was looking for.They support my weight with no issues and are easy to fold back up and store.*** I hope you find this review real, helpful, and really helpful! ***",Decent Chairs,"These are decent all metal chairs. The quality of the components is good. The painted finish is evenly applied, and it looks great. The chairs arrived unblemished. The comfort of the chairs is what you would expect from a metal chair. They are comfortable for short periods of sitting, but for extended periods, a padded chair would be better. The weight limit of the chairs is 250 pounds.",what i need,"after buying a folding table for my kids outdoor birthday parties and using camping chairs temporarily i have been looking for some chairs like this, they are exactly what i have been looking for. easy to store in my garage, doesn't take up much space, easy to fold and unfold, pretty good sturdy quality and works great for day/night parties, item is exactly as described and pictured",20,7,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097CR291Y

Would buy again.,I'm very impressed with these speakers.,"These speakers sound great! I have 15 of them throughout my home, powered by a couple nice multi-channel amplifiers that put out 120 watts per zone (stereo pair) and they really sound great. I have two of them in each bedroom, and they are so loud that they shake the floor of the bedroom above them, lol.

Thanks.",These were easy to install,"These were easy to install. My new house was pre-wired so that made it that much easier.

For the money they are fantastic. Quality better than expected, they sound great, and powerful enough to get the job done. My only negative is that they are virtually all high range (treble) and little to no bass. In all fairness though I am running them off of a receiver that may be partially to blame for that. I am going to add a powered sub to get some thump into my music but the speakers themselves are pretty darn good for the relatively small cost..",532,150,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EAU9DPO

That's false. Also stated was that these are somehow different from those in the upright white container. Lysol made these to cut down on plastic waste especially important when they doubled production to meet demand during COVID-19. They contain the SAME ingredients as the upright white container wipes. This kills 6 strains of the corona virus, and that includes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 which is also known as COVID-19. These are perfect for travel. I love the opening... seals shut easily. I keep them in my tote bag to wipe down pumps at the gas station, buggy handles at the market, etc. I saved the Clorox Wipes in the hard container for use inside the home.Depending on the lemon scent (yellow) or the fresh scent (green), the packaging closure differs. The yellow packaging has a snap closure to seal in the moisture of the wipes. The green packaging has a sticky film the you re-attach to seal in the moisture. Just something to consider when you see them offered. I prefer the yellow packaging closure but I love the fresh scent. Maybe Clorox will change the packaging on the fresh scent (green) but I think right now they are just trying to meet demand and getting as many products out during COVID which is appreciated.",Legit,"Man, when the pandemic hit I was so unaware.

This is also a great idea so you always have the keys.",Ignore the bad reviews.,"I saw the bad reviews, some of them horrible, and bought this based on the overall rating... then awaited its arrival with dread. Opening the box, my first thought was that it was TINY, as in super compact. Installed it first on my desktop Mac, which is easily 10 years old, and had it running in less than 15 minutes. Then installed it on my Windows laptop, and had it running again in less than 15 minutes. Being honest, I'm over 40, I'm not a techno-guy, but I figured this out myself.Setting it to ""Text"" scanning, 300 DPI, and turning on all the ""Auto Fix The Problem"" features, half of which I don't really know what they do, I'm able to hit the ""Start Scan"" button, and then just start feeding in paper one sheet at a time. It's about 3-4 seconds a sheet, then you feed in the next one. Minor differences in operation from Mac to Windows, but in both cases, I got a multi-page PDF, that I could run character recognition on with Adobe and then search through.Why this way? Clients of mine give me stacks of paperwork for me to deal with, and I need to get them scanned and give them back. In the old days, clients would bring documents to me or I would go get them and bring them to the office. I'd Xerox them all and filled file cabinet after file cabinet. Then I got a copier/scanner and we'd still have to run around with paper, but I'd scan it instead. Now? House calls are a snap. No third party phone app, no photos and cropping. Set up, scan on the spot, and head out. Love it.",Just right for small office jobs,"I bought this scanner for my ""pandemic home office,"" as a backup for our Canon desktop printer/scanner that was inconveniently located and required saving files to a thumb drive. My scanning volume is light, and the Brother is just what I needed. It easily plugged right into my laptop, and the driver download went smoothly the first time. Each page is scanned to an individual file but, with addition of the Power PDF software (included as a very nice option during driver installation), files are easily combined. For the price, you'd be hard pressed to find a better home scanning solution.",AN AMAZING AND FUN LITTLE MACHINE,"I am not a techie. I was surprised that I could manage to set this up on my own. My download speed is quite slow because of where I live so the download time for the free Brother download took a long time. Nevertheless, I am now scanning everything in sight, including my plastic driver's license, and photographs, and copies of bills and e-mailing them all over the place! And once they are scanned, I can also print them off with my printer. It is great fun. I learned from the reviews that for what I had to scan, the setting should be for JPEG. I also adjusted the quality to the highest possible resolution just because that's how I like it. I don't have much to scan so I wasn't worried about computer space. There is an add-on app for Kofax PDF Standard. YOU DO NOT NEED THIS. They give you a free trial, but if you purchase it, it costs $129. It also takes up a massive amount of computer space and slowed down my computer. I took a risk and uninstalled it, and voila! I can still scan just like before. Don't pay attention to the reviews complaining about the location of the cord and how it gets in the way of scanning. They fixed that problem long ago. The cord is on the side and does not get in the way of anything. I am disabled and can't drive somewhere to make photocopies. Even if I could drive, I can't stay standing in one spot for more than a few seconds without risking a partial seizure. I have been paying someone every time I needed photocopies made, which was more often than you would think. Not having to worry anymore about photocopying has lowered my anxiety. I love this thing!",This scanner is so AMAZING!,"This scanner is AMAZING!! I have scanned approx. 2000 photos and documents since purchasing just two weeks ago.

While I have not yet used the USB ports, the 110V outlets work just fine and offer plenty of space, even for big plugs.

However, the cord hassle drives me nuts pulling them tangled out of my purse. Seriously, I‚Äôm pissed when my phone is ringing and all I want is to pull my headphones out, plug, and talk.Enter the Belkin tangle-free headphones. Game changer! They come with three different silicone earpiece sizes (I have small ears so this was surprisingly a great feature!). I didn‚Äôt realize how much the proper earpiece size would improve the experience for me.On to the dirty details: the cord is flat, not round and sticky. So, it never gets tangled in a tight knot even when I‚Äôm pulling it out of the depths of my purse. This alone would‚Äôve sold me on these headphones. Do they come out perfectly? No, but I stuffed them in there with no care and I can pull them out and straighten them for immediate use in less than 5 seconds. To make me love them even more, they are proper noise canceling headphones. I put them in chat away and take them out to find there‚Äôs loud construction going on outside. Couldn‚Äôt hear a thing with them in!The microphone quality is clutch as well. I‚Äôve had numerous people ask me on calls what Headset I‚Äôm using because the sound quality is so good. They‚Äôve become my go to for work calls.Another feature I really like over any of the wireless headsets I have is the volume controls on the cable. I find I forget the buttons on my wireless ones or the buttons aren‚Äôt easy to press when I‚Äôm wearing them which is annoying. The control feature on the Belkin is perfect - I can easily change the volume and there‚Äôs tactile raised bumps so I know where to press. It also lets me mute, hang up the call, or go to the next song. It‚Äôs a feature I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd care about and didn‚Äôt weigh into my purchase decision until I got them and it simply works perfectly and easily. Going forward, any wired headset will have to have the control feature and it‚Äôll be hard to top the Belkin execution.",Decent value for money.,Good solid construction. Been sleeping with these on for a couple months now and nothing has broken yet. Sound quality is decent for the price point. Volume is good enough for what I need it for. It's not a base thumping headset so if that is what you want you will need to look at something else. Once these are in your ears it deadens sounds from around you fairly well but these are not passive or active noise cancellation ear buds so if that is what you want to get you will need to spend more money. Overall a solid set of ear buds that fits in the lightening connector and are not apple ones which do not fit in my ear at all.,very pleased,"Bought these to replace a different pair that busted after 2+ years of near daily use. I love the tangle resistant cables. At first, I was disappointed in the sound, but I improved it considerably by using the old silicone bud covers from my busted pair to tighten the fit (nearly identical to the ones that came with these, but you know, princess and the pea), and changed my iPhone EQ settings from ""rock"" to ""late night."" The sound went from being a little muddy and closed to bright and wide. I mostly listen to rock.",Why isn't something like this included anymore with $1k+ phones !?!,"I will tell you why - one company - CrApple. They can make claims it is save the environment but they went cheap, so others started following. This should be mandatory. The only thing I wish it had a pass-thru for USB-C charging.

I use the AnnePro 2 at home, the Keychron at work and the ducky One 2 mini to play online. For all-around tasks, the most versatile is by far the Anne Pro 2.Connectivity.I can pair it with my iPhone Ipad and Mac via Bluetooth and switch seamlessly between the 3 devices (even while the USB is connected to the keyboard.) something the keychron k2 cannot do.)Aesthetics and Build Quality.The keyboard is well built, sturdy and premium, and if you want to travel it isn't extremely heavy.Both my other keyboards are black so I went for the white version of the AP2 and IT IS GORGEOUS! I was a bit skeptical before I ordered it but when it arrived I was delighted, and still am!The only main issue I found is that you cannot modify the angle, so you are basically stuck with the angle the keyboard comes with. I got used to it because basically it is exactly the same angle as my Ducky On 2 mini. There are not little feet below the keyboard.All the keycaps are white but it comes with some custom color keycaps which I like to use (Pic related). I really like the ""lego"" look of those keycaps.RGB is bright fully customizable and has plenty of effects. I am not a fan of effects and use colors for key purposes basically so I can't give you a review of effects, sorry for that.Software.Another great thing about this keyboard is the software, so no need to memorize Keystrokes in order to create macros, change the layout to PC or Mac, Customize RBG colors, you can do everything from the software (Available for Mac PC, and Linux), even update the Firmware.TAP featureFor those getting a 60% keyboard, you will notice there are no arrows on that keyboards, BUT the AP2 has a TAP layer feature which lets you use the right shift and keys below as arrows when you press them once.IT is great for people getting used to the 60% layout. Take into account that if you want to SHIFT select text or other key combination, the TAP feature is useless, you will have to FN WASD and SHIFT at the same time. It takes a bit to get used to it, but after a while, the TAP function helps you transition.SHIPPINGShipping was insane!!!! I live in Spain, from the US the keyboard arrived in 2 DAYS!!! When usually I have to wait a week or so for items to arrive from the US.Best SELLER EVER!Review typed on my Anne Pro 2.",The Perfect 60%,"Finally, FINALLY a Anne pro 2 from a seller that works! I had ordered this keyboard from another seller twice before, the first one the lighting wouldn‚Äôt work properly and the second one, wouldn‚Äôt even get recognized and when the pc did recognize it, it couldn‚Äôt be updated with the firmware which in the end resulted in a dead keyboard.Found this seller which sold the version Anne Pro 2 X SainSonicAnd it‚Äôs flawless. Completely flawless.Keys are solid, switches (brown gateron) are perfectAnd they even have a sainsonic red keycap that‚Äôs in the box extra along with the other color keycaps.10/10 from me.Guess third times a charm!",Great compact keyboard,"I wanted to share my impressions of the Anne Pro 2, and I am writing this review on the Anne Pro 2 because this keyboard is truly a pleasure to type on. If you want the short version of the review you can stop reading here. If you want more information, read on.First a little backstory of how I ended up with this keyboard. Since I am now spending more time than ever at home in front of the computer I decided I wanted a new keyboard. I always had a passing interest in mechanical keyboards so I started doing research on them. I wanted my new keyboard to be wireless, look great, and be compatible with Mac. I also wanted a keyboard that felt great to type on. I remember being in college in the 90s and typing on computers that had very satisfying clicky keyboards. I wanted to find a keyboard that could make typing fun again. The Anne Pro 2 seemed to check all my boxes, so I ordered one.The keyboard arrived yesterday and here are my initial impressions. The keyboard has impressive build quality and is much heavier than expected. Even though the keyboard has a plastic frame this thing is solid! Typing on the keyboard is a joy. I got the brown switches since they are supposed to be good for typing but more quiet than the blues. The brown switches still make a lot of noise. So much so that my son just came from the next room and asked me what I was typing, but I really enjoy the sound.Setting up bluetooth was not easy and took a couple attempts but this was due to user error as I pressed the wrong function key. Bluetooth appears to be working well now with no noticeable lag. I had read some reviews that stated the bluetooth didn‚Äôt work well but I have not had any major issues. I also read reviews stating that the backlight was not that bright so I expected to be underwhelmed by the lighting but I think it looks amazing.One nice thing about the Anne Pro 2 is that it comes with extra keycaps and a keycap puller so you can customize it a bit. I changed out my escape key with one of the extra keycaps and it was an easy process.Another nice feature of the Anne Pro 2 is the tap arrows as the keyboard does not have dedicated arrow keys. I have found the tap arrow keys work well and I do not miss the dedicated arrow keys. I also found a cool short cut to show battery life expressed in lights on the top row of the keyboard. This is helpful to know when it is time to plug in the keyboard to charge.As for the software I downloaded the software for my Mac without issue but the Obins iOS software does not appear to be working. This seems to be a common issue that hopefully Obins will address in a future update.Overall I am really pleased with this keyboard and recommend this keyboard to others looking for a more satisfying typing experience. The one caveat I would say is know that this keyboard is not quite as plug and play as some more mainstream keyboards. There is a small learning curve to learn how all the features work but well worth it in my opinion.",The BEST all around 60% keyboard,"So I've owned all the hyped up 60% keyboards, most notably, the Durgod Venus, Ducky One 2, Razer Hunstman Mini (both switches) and most recently the Kemove Shadow/Snowfox. I'll be reviewing the Anne Pro 2 with Kailh Box Whites.The Durgod is also a solid keyboard, software holds it back big time, along with the smaller port for USB C which is too small for your custom cables. Great build quality and durable materials but again, it just felt lacking for the $130 USD with my switch of choice.Let me make this short and sweet. There are all things wrong with the keyboards I listed above, just like there are a few things wrong with this one. I think that the software for all other than this and the Ducky are absolute trash. People are raving about the Keymove keyboard lately, it's pretty decent at best and the switch selection is mediocre for the price, yes it is hot swappable but the frame isn't what I'd personally go with if I wanted to keep this keyboard and swap long term.The Ducky is also a great keyboard. I think that it's very close between the Ducky and the Anne Pro 2. Personally, I enjoy most Kailh box switches and prefer them to anything else. The selection on the Ducky is great but the prices for the Kailh switches are insane on them, $150 for Jades? No thanks. Build quality is probably on par with the Anne, though I do admit the keycaps are a tiny bit better.In summary, I really do believe that this Anne Pro 2 has all of the features you could ever want, great build quality and a versatile switch selection to fit anyone's personal preference. This board really does have it all and I don't forsee myself using anything but this for a long time.",5337,365,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y4ZVP6J

It is sturdy and beautiful. Unfortunately the rise bar is a little too high for me. I had to pay to have bike assembled and now I will have to order a new seat as the original seat is too small. I also need to purchase new pedals with straps. Now with all that said I still rate this bike a 4 or 5. The parts I have to order are because I have mobility, balance and other physical deterrents that I did not realize would be a hindrance to riding a bike. So l encourage you to be far more truthful to yourself than I was when I ordered. I thought the fact that it was an adult triycle that would taƒ∑e care of any issues I might face.

Beautiful purple and white.,What an excellent seller,"Update: I am so impressed with this seller. They have gone above and beyond and made everything right. I have changed my rating because a seller that takes care of their customers is worth 5 stars.First off, I would like to say that the seller has been responsive in the issues with my new tricycle. But they seem to only want to compensate for some problems.From the getgo there were issues.In step one of assembling the derailleur, it was slightly bent. Then there ended up being a metal nub that was keeping the new derailleur from being installed properly.Took it to a bike shop and they did what they could to get things proper. But the metal nub was still an issue, so we had to grind it off.Next was the brakes. Back brakes don't work or rather the back wheel won't spin freely, that's even with the brakes completely disconnected (still haven't gotten that fixed and we aren't sure how to fix it). Front brakes don't work well and squeel when applied so we had to get new upgraded ones.The chain broke, they are sending a new one. I've had the bike a couple few weeks now and haven't been able to even leave the property with it.I get that it was a good price and it looks beautiful and I really want to be able to ride it. It's unfortunate that there have been so many issues straight out of the box.",1106,93,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0892P1NRK

I purchased it for use in our garage as a kind of all purpose extra work/hobby space or casual hanging spot for a quick chat and tea. When you compare it to the asking price of the typical metal frame/vinyl topped card tables, it‚Äôs an especially amazing value. My hubby was griping, only half-jokingly, that it‚Äôs way too heavy...which is not a typical complaint of mass produced portable furniture. It‚Äôs so solid! No wobbling, smooth finish, no overpowering chemical odor. And packaged brilliantly; ours was delivered on a soggy day and sat on our porch for hours. Terrified it would be damaged, I was thrilled to discover it was double boxed and meticulously wrapped. I‚Äôve ordered higher end pieces that don‚Äôt receive this care in packaging.One reviewer said the legs didn‚Äôt lock, but the table I received in early 2019 certainly has locking legs. I opted for the scalloped cherry finish which is not really ‚Äòcherry‚Äô. Cherry woods typically have a reddish tint and read more formal...which can skew a little shiny, but this is more of a low sheen medium brown that I‚Äôd describe as a walnut or fruitwood. As this table is offered in fruitwood too, I‚Äôm curious what that finish looks like?It may be portable and merely intended for extra seating for kiddos or for doing games and puzzles, but when I was a college aged kid on a tight budget, I sure wouldn‚Äôt have hesitated to use this as an actual full time dining table in my tiny apartment. It shames anything similar from the big box stores. Do note it‚Äôs slightly smaller than the standard card table but losing a couple of inches is so worth it. However, it is genuinely sturdy so I wouldn‚Äôt want my elderly mom lugging it about; unless that‚Äôs an issue for you, do not hesitate to purchase. Five big stars for quality, appearance, and affordability.",Small stunning table,"This table is magnificent. The picture shows how beautiful it looks with a chair pushed in and satin tablecloth. It's an elegant dining room table for my small home. It's slightly taller than a regular card table, making it perfect for dining. I bought it from Amazon Warehouse for a reduced price and couldn't find one flaw with it. It's 100% perfect. Don't hesitate to buy this one. You will thank yourself when you open the box. It's all ready to go. No installation; just click out the legs, turn over, and there you have it!",This is a beautiful piece of functional furniture!,"We bought this table for jigsaw puzzles. We wanted a table that was attractive, sturdy and not too big. This table is perfect! Folds and unfolds easily...looks like a nice piece of furniture.",Perfect small table,"This table was easy to put together and set up, and looks really nice. We needed a small table for our small apartment and I was going to put it up after our guests left at Christmas but it‚Äôs come in so handy I‚Äôve kept it up continued to use it. It doesn‚Äôt look cheap and it‚Äôs very sturdy. Perfect little table for games, breakfast, crafts or homework.",GORGEOUS wood table with folding legs,"This is SO much nicer than your standard all plastic, poor quality department store folding table that seems to be all you can find lately. It is real wood, and it's solid. Not particle board, or laminated wood, it's an actual solid wood table. The height is perfect and it looks so good, nice enough to actually use full time as a small dining table if one desires, or to have extra guests use when there aren't enough seats at the dining room table.The only negative is that it was slightly dinged on one edge in shipping. I haven't made a big deal about it, because that is more the shipper's fault...but it could be protected on the edges a little better to prevent that.The shippers around here are a bunch of baboons anyway, and like destroying things. So I can't really blame that on the manufacturer.VERY VERY nice table!!!",950,301,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PP0G0K4

The pens right smoothly and have a low smudge factor from what I have experienced. They have a comfortable grip and balance for small (kids) or larger hands (adults). My son and I both like these pens and think that they glide/flow very well. As my son writes more papers and gets used to writing in pen, these pens make the process easier.

Yippeeee!!!,"I am at that fun age and started waking at night due to hot flashes.

I should've bought this years ago, when I first heard about it from Tim Ferriss.A few critiques:* I'd love if it could go cooler, or if the unit was more powerful. Setting it to the lowest setting of 55¬∞F is a super comfy temperature, but it needs a solid hour of cooling off on its own with a blanket over it to reach that temperature, and it hovers around 65¬∞ when I'm laying on it.* The 10 hour timer is annoying. I have to remember to shut it off and back on again right before I go to bed (because I start it about an hour before to cool off). I'd love an easy way to schedule it to go on and off automatically, or just adjust the timer.* Running out of water caught me off guard. I woke up at 4am a few nights ago with a very not chilly bed, and had to figure out how to top it off with DI water in the dark. I'd love a bigger reservoir with a clear panel so I could see how full it is from the outside.That said, it's totally worth maintaining it. On nights it hasn't worked at 100% because of not enough lead time to get chilly or running out of water, I've slept considerably worse.",Impossible to sleep without this!,"I love Chilipad. This is my 2nd one. The first one lasted for about 6 years I think. I use it every single night and some days to take naps. Without it, I get impossibly hot! It has been a life saver!

I only notice this when I rub my fingers across the pad.* To ensure the unit doesn't run out of water unexpectedly, proactively refill the unit with distilled water every few days to a week (water evaporates)",570,182,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GT9NNZD

For the price of one massage at a spa, I got this massager that I can use anytime in my comfortable home and it has helped me to release my muscle tension that I need after work and the gym. This massager has multi-functional features which makes it a great product to use. The massage nodes can be adjusted for different heights that benefits both me and my husband. Not only does it have different types of massages, such as rolling and kneading, it also has has heat function which is good for winter time. My favorite part is there are 4 types of massage for me to choose: full back, upper, lower and fixed spot. I am able to adjust which type of massage I need and release my muscle tension. It‚Äôs portable and can be placed on my couch while I am watching TV, a chair while I am on my computer or on my bed while I am reading. I would totally recommend this massager to anyone who needs a massage but does not want to pay big bucks at the spa.",Provides a Nice Massage - Easy to Use - Stores Easily,"The Snailax Massager arrived with no damage and required no assembly or real set-up before use. Once unboxed you just set the massage chair on a stable chair, plug in the power adapter into and outlet, the other end into the massager cord, and you are ready to go.Note: I tried both of my massagers on various surfaces including a couch and a recliner chair, but prefer the solid surface of a solid high-back chair. Unlike my other massager, the Snailax has two elastic seat straps that help keep the massager in place. If you do not have a high-back chair, you can often find very nice and inexpensive high-back chairs at thrift stores.Once set up there are several massage options, many of which can be used separately or all at once.1) Shiatsu Neck and Shoulder Massage (Heat On/Off - 5, 10, 15 Minute Timer)‚Ä¢ In this mode, 4 massage nodes rotate clockwise or counterclockwise, with or without heat. The height of the neck and shoulder massage nodes can be adjusted up or down using the remote, which is a handy feature if more than one person is going to be using this massager.‚Ä¢ I am a little under 5‚Äô 10‚Äù and was able to adjust the massage nodes to for me perfectly. Two friends of mine, one 5‚Äô 2‚Äù tall and the other 5‚Äô 5‚Äù tall, also had no problem in adjusting the neck and shoulder massage nodes to fit them. (If you are on the shorter side, you could also use a pillow on the seat.)2) Shiatsu Back Massage (Heat On/Off - 5, 10, 15 Minute Timer)‚Ä¢ This mode is used for the back, with 4 adjustable and heated massage nodes that can be set to 4 modes.‚Ä¢ Full Back: The massage nodes travel up and down the full length of your back.‚Ä¢ Upper Back: The massage nodes concentrate on your upper back.‚Ä¢ Lower Back: The massage modes concentrate on your lower back.‚Ä¢ Spot: In this mode you use can adjust the massage nodes up or down to an exact area.3) Rolling Back Massage (Heat On/Off - 5, 10, 15 Minute Timer)‚Ä¢ This mode works exactly like the Shiatsu Massage mode (minus the ‚ÄúSpot mode) however instead of Shiatsu circular node patterns the massage nodes travel simply travel up and down.4) Seat Vibration (2 Levels)‚Ä¢ This mode causes the seat to vibrate (low or high); there is no heat option in this mode.So do you get a decent massage from this Snailax Massager? I say yes, definitely. I use the back massager primarily in the Shiatsu/Heated mode adjusting the massage nodes to either travel my back fully or adjusting it to the areas that need it most.I also really like the neck and shoulder massager as I can easily adjust the height to get the massage nodes exactly as I need them. I find that using both the back and the neck/shoulder massager modes at the same time to be relaxing. If I want a deeper massage, I will use either mode separately.As for the vibrating seat, I sometimes use this option. It is merely a vibrating sensation that some may or may not like.When done using the massager I simply unplug it, fold the bottom seat portion up, and store it in the closet.In conclusion, don‚Äôt expect the Snailax Massager to provide the same massage as a huge and expensive massage chair. However, for the price and compact size I feel it provides a pretty thorough (and relaxing) massage.I will update this review if I encounter any issues.",Very love neck shoulder shiatsu and spot function,"Ordered this new massage chair pad to replace my broken old one. Important to choose the body position and relax. ""Spot"" is a very good function, i can let it keep shiatsu in one area of my full back. Pillow side not inflated, and neck shoulder shiatsu is strong and very well. Seat vibration under your feet well. Vibration chair is quite strong and quiet. To compare both massage chair pad, here are the functions old one doesn't have neck, shoulder shiatsu, spot and seat vibration. So the new one has most powerful. Good for the money!",After back surgery...,"I got this because I was having a lot of back muscle spasms after back surgery. It has been a tremendous help, eliminated the spasms and the massage is important to keep the blood circulating thus helping in healing, in my opinion. I'm a big fan of the Shiatsu massage, it feels like real hand massage, especially in the neck area. Has a timer and heat if wanted. It's worth the price just for the better health and healing. All around great features, and it was easy to unpack, I had to have assistance because or a weight limit due to the surgery but my 10 year old grandson, easily opened and set it up for me.

Each day, on the left hand page I put the date and then a list of things I can or should do. (I cross them out when done. A cross out ending in an arrow to the right means that I did not do them, but instead entered them on the next day's left hand page.) I use the right hand side of the two open pages to make notes of conversations or what I did as a I go along-for example showing calculations or commitments and usually the name of whoever answered the phone and what they said.Using this technique means that people can trust you to do what you said you would do.You can enter an A, B, or C next to the list--""A"" means must do today, for example. This works better than re-writing lists in order of importance.I imagine that over the years I've filled up over a hundred of these things.

This makes it much harder for your child to rip out pages and inevitably cuts down on paper wastage. It comes with a place for your child's class schedule on the inside front cover, and multiplication table, conversion table, and grammar rules on inside back cover.

Grade A!","Excellent for Young, High Acheivers","I needed a writing notebook or a 1st grader who works at a 3rd grade level for writing. All of the other books at the K-2 level have picture space, which I understand, but didn't need. The 3rd grade and above notebooks have too small of lines typically for a 7 year old. This notebook provides the correct line size, eliminates the picture space (wasted space for us), and allows the writer to focus solely on his/her actual writing.",Best bill recorder ever had plenty of room to write keeps me organized and out of troublenm,I use one of these to keep track of my monthly bills I assign in order a month to a page ... write down all the bills that I know I'm going to have ...And as they come in and I pay them ...I simply color their line with a pastel colored pencil.. so at any point in time I will know exactly which bills have not come in and how I need to be preparing for them and beside each listing ...example: Electric company I write in the number the check and the date and pertinate information or how I paid for it... by phone?

I used to pick some up when they went on sale for back-to-school, but with the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 I skipped shopping in physical locations.

I still haven't gotten around to vacuuming the sprinkles (they're kind of ground-in now), but I did use it to vacuum all of the spiders from my basement and porches - it doesn't kill them and I let them all go in the yard after. To be honest, it was kind of horrifying to have like 30 spiders pour out of a hand vac at once (which I hadn't considered during the planning stages), but they seemed happy enough and scattered to the four corners of the yard. Godspeed, little arachnids.","Variables to consider. (‚ÄúA+‚Äù Purchase, considering price)","I read a lot of weird reviews related to suction-strength duration and battery life. Now, because I‚Äôm old, I now know there is not always a fire where you see smoke. So, I bought it anyway, due to price vs OVERALL rating, and here is a neutral review from, generally, a relatively picky but not obnoxious customer.BATTERY LIFE: if you wanna CLEAN your car, you‚Äôre going to be disappointed, and your perception negative, when it comes to this vacuum. My pictures are of the area I use the vac to ‚ÄúKEEP TIDY‚Äù. I pick up littler box dust trails and sloppy-kitty-food-eating-spillage all day (maybe 30 seconds of use, about 4x a day).Well, I only charge it every 4 days... and there is still charge left. I really just charge for suction power maintenance.SUCTION: It mainly picks up dust and cat-litter-gravel-leftover, which is trailed 2 feet all around his litter box, as well as about a small hand-full-at-a-time of kitty food (size reference: Blue Buffalo for kittens), each time I use it. That was it‚Äôs purpose for purchase.Now, OF COURSE it super sucks hard when u first take it off the charge and, I‚Äôd agree it ‚Äúpalpably‚Äù reduces in strength within only the first 5 min of usage (that‚Äôs a whole days worth of intermittent usage), but by day 3 and 4 you still have way sufficient charge AND suction-power to get the same job done. JUST GET A LITTLE CLOSER TO GARBAGE AND GO A BIT SLOWER... hello!EASY TO CLEAN: In a quick answer, YES. It‚Äôs super easy to clean. That being said, if you hate or are allergic to dust, you WILL be fiddling around with lots of it, so FYI. This doesn‚Äôt bother me, so 4.5 stars for ease of cleaning.WHAT‚ÄôS GREAT: Just click the button, canister comes off, empty in trash, dust off with wet paper towel... DONE! I do clean it every evening to help with suction, which extends battery life as well.WHAT SUX: The filter (though a snap to remove) needs to be beat on the trash can wall to get all debris off it and you may have to pick off tiny items that adhere to the felt fibers of the filter.IN THE END: If you‚Äôre cool with this, which 90% should be, the whole ‚Äúcleaning process‚Äù is less than 3 min. I‚Äôve counted.For the price, and I‚Äôm on Social Security so, there‚Äôs really no excuse, it‚Äôs been a life saver. I hate little garbage and kitty debris all over, or anywhere on, the floor.This helps me look down, next to my bed, and not feel suffocated by an unnecessary, untidy mess on the floor.‚ÄúB‚Äú Purchase, overall.‚ÄúA+‚Äú Purchase, considering price.",Exactly what I needed,"I hate vacuuming stairs, so this was perfect for me. I mounted it behind the bannister, and can just grab it every so often as I go upstairs. Works great for cat hair, it's light, easy to clean, and inexpensive. I've had it about 4 months, and its great, but if it dies I'd buy another one just for its convenience and size.",Much better than my 10 yr old B&D Dustbuster and a good value.,"I had been looking to replace my old dustbuster with Nicad rechargeables as it was on death's door. I chose this one and am happy I did. It is much stronger at vacuuming than my previous one and in a quick test on a full charge over night it ran for about 15 minutes picking up dirt in my house and in my car. Lithium batteries are the standard now and are a huge improvement.It's a basic unit that can be used on its own in the house on counters or floors or with one of the two nozzles on furniture, carpeting or in the car. One nozzle has a brush end and the other just extends to reach into small spaces, like those in a car. It has the wall hanger that keeps it charged.The push to operate power button works with a very light touch and I now prefer it to an on-off switch. I found that if you hoover up a spider web, you will need to hose out the dust compartment, but otherwise it is easy to dump the contents in the trash.For $30 it works efficiently on crumbs and dust bunnies etc but isn't as efficient on large areas or carpeting as a proper vacuum. But it's so convenient hanging in the laundry room you just grab it, use it and hang it back up.BTW, I'm not on anyone's payroll here, just thought others would like my honest opinion.",Really good little vac,"We made the mistake of buying lightweight cat little and our cat tracked it ALL over the house, specifically onto the bed and in the 5square feet around her box despite there being a mat. For kitty litter, this thing is amazing. Our cat is also a messy eater and it also sucks up her pieces of cat food stuck in the groove between the wall and carpet. Then i started using this thing everywhere. Car, window sill, bathroom, and even on our kitchen floor (its really small and id rather do this than sweep.) Holding down the button really isnt a big deal. Id say this has been my favorite thing ive gotten off of amazon in a really long time. I use it like 3x a week.",15646,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DAWQU12

The printer came well packaged with a lot of shipping tape to hold the printer parts in place.Setup was so easy using my iPhone and the Epson app. The app walked you through the various steps to setup the printer. The inks basically load them selves, each ink has a different configuration and printer has a corresponding configuration. The ink bottle loads only enough to fill the color tank then stops the fill process. There are several choices to get the printer connected, I opted for wifi. Epson made this process so easy to connect to WiFi using my iPhone. There are two front trays, one for 8x11 paper the other for photo stock. There is one rear feed for all types of papers. After several 4x6 and 5x7 test prints on Epson Ultra Premium Paper and I‚Äôm impressed by the quality. This printer is a pro quality printer.The Epson ET-8500 is expensive, in this case you will get what you pay for. I hope to save money by not having to purchase replacement ink cartridges for my old printer every couple of months. I do have one concern. There is an output tray that comes out of the printer that is motor driven when a print has finished. I hope the motor drive holds up after thousands of uses ( there is a neat led light illuminating the output trap ). I prefer to close the output tray when I have finished my printing process.",All as it should be,"I have accumulated a number of printers over the years including an old Canon Pixma 6000D photo printer, an HP 1200 laser jet that has been my workhorse for 30 years, and an HP 5530 multi-function. I was looking for something to replace all of these and especially the older photo printer because although it prints great photos, lacks a Windows 10 driver. Thought I would give this Epson ET-8500 a try.It arrived last week, very fast shipping, and setup was super simple. Have no idea why anyone complains or has posted issues installing this printer. Just follow the instructions. Not a drop of ink spilled, everything worked first time, doing the alignment (following the instructions) was fairly easy. The one thing I would say is that comments regarding finding and removing all the blue tape does take time. I missed the one under the front paper tray and that became obvious when I tried to print for the first time. Note that there are two trays in the front and the drop-down cover is the front of the top paper tray in the front is the top tray. The one underneath I put my photo paper. The printer is a lot smaller than I thought it would be. I do not intend to use the back paper tray unless I have unusual size paper to print.First prints were great. Color is great - - as good as my old Pixma 6000D. This is my first Epson buy and I'm very happy. I'm using only the wifi to connect and have had zero problems printing B/W on letter size paper and 4X6 pictures (on photo-paper) using my Windows laptop, Apple iPad, and Apple iPhone. All worked first time. Like that settings allow the printer to wake itself up so no need to keep it on. Scanner is also fast and the Epson software very adequate. Hope my good experiences continue. I give this printer a 5 star. So far so good.",Take your time to set it up,"This printer is great, the quality of the output is superb, but as with any printer you have to send quality images to the printer. The marketing pitch for this printer is the savings on ink, understand that a pack of ink bottles not including Black is $87 but I have printed at least 6 13x19 prints both black & white and color, at least 12 or 13 8.5x11 prints and several 4x6 full color prints all excellent quality. The ink tanks are barely below the full mark except for the Gray ink, it seems to go down faster.. If I did this with my other printer I would have gone through two or three ink cartridges by now both B&W and color (about $53 per cartridge set) so I think their sales pitch is legit!The one drawback I see is that you have to print frequently or the print heads can clog up. I don't know about how frequent but if you are going to print a large print once a month or any print once a month you are better of just going to a lab. This is mainly a photo printer but you can print other things as well, text etc.",8550 is a very good little printer for photo and office work. Very happy with it.,"Thoughts about Epson 8550 photo printerGREAT LITTLE PRINTERThe 8550 has some major advantages over other printers in addition to the price, which is reasonable. and so far I really like it.I am stepping down from an expensive 24‚Äù wide track photo printer and I think is is a good idea for me.I have owned two 24 inch wide track Photo printers that were very expensive and the inks were outrageous. I could buy 10 8550 printers for what I spent on wide tracks.The 8550 ink tank is a huge cost savings. Another advantage is the 8550 can also be used for everyday office use which helps prevent the print heads from clogging up which happens on my pricey 24‚Äù printers regularly. There are multiply feed trays so you aren't constantly changing paper from plain to photo.I can settle for 13x19‚Äù for most of my work and my larger 24x36 prints can be outsourced for a fraction of what I spent printing them myself.Color was a concern before buying the 8550, but not any more. It is not as good as 11 color inks but with a little tweaking the color is surprisingly good. Really good. Working with HDR images allows me enough adjustment to make great prints from the 8550, even without custom color profiles. So far I am happy with what I can achieve with the 8550 and think it will perform even better as I zero in on what it needs for greatness.Another huge advantage is the ability to print sizes from 4x6 to 13x19 or longer. This allows me to do test prints at 4x6‚Äù and when the image is perfect, I can print large on the very same paper in a 13x19 format with complete confidence. Huge saving.You will need a powerful loupe or magnifying glass to accurately view the head alignment prints, but it really is very easy to do and the printer guides you right through it. The WiFi was also easy to set up which was a improve from my past experiences.Great little printer, so farHad it over a month now and still really like this printer. Price has increased a lot since I bought it but I still recommend it.",Fabulous printer,"well it Finally showed up and I couldn't wait to open it and get it hooked up. Well after installing the ink 6x 70mil bottles was the 1st thing I liked ""NO MORE CARTRAGES"" after running all the setup and alignment stuff that was a breeze, I was ready to print something. I bought this printer to print my bands album covers jackets on 130lb Matte card stock 13"" X 26"" X 18 pieces, boy it printed them great so I also had some Posters that I printer on some 13""x 19"" glossy 42lb stock x 55 pieces thats 73 prints at this size 13x19+. The prints came out fantastic so in all I love this printer and is a great piece of equipment very easy to use and the 4"" touch screen and the ink wells you can tell how much ink is left just buy looking at the reservoirs and I am almost to the 1st mark on the top of the ink wells.

Here is the email address if anyone else should have issue and need to contact them for warranty replacement. Support@snailax.com. Due to the prompt response and concern for getting a new one out to me I will give them a Rating of excellence.,light and easy to use/carry,,Excellent Shiatsu Massage Cushion,"We ordered a Shiatsu Neck Massager Pillow from Snailax a little over three months ago and it worked very well. We all liked it, so recently we decided to buy this Shiatsu Massage Cushion from the same manufacturer. It was ordered on January 28, and it arrived two days later, as expected. The delivery was fast. When it arrived, the package was in very good condition. We tested it the night when it arrived. And it was amazing. We placed it on my office chair (see the photo) and it fits the chair very well. The massage has a controller, which has several functions that we like: the heat function is extremely useful to add warmth to the back as it massages; The spot function allows adjusting the massage spots up and down; and the vibration function allows selection of low, medium, and high vibration for the seat. In addition, the timer function for 5, 10 and 15 minutes was helpful. I can adjust the massage strength by adjusting my back position (press harder or lighter against the massage). I actually have been using this massage when I sit in my office listening to music. It is very relaxing and soothing after a day's of work. I also tried a couple of time to use it together with our neck massage and the two seem to work well together. The package also comes with a car adapter and I suppose this massage cushion could also be used in my car, but I have not tried that as I do not want it to disturb me while I am driving. Overall, we have had great experience with Snailax massages.",Snailax Shiatsu Massage Cushion is Nice! I already own a seat cushion massager,"Snailax Shiatsu Massage Cushion is Nice! I already own a seat cushion massager. It nearly pushes me out of the chair and feels rough when the massager rolls up my back. Snailax Shiatsu Massage Cushion has a quieter sound, gentle yet firm movement and is a better product overall. The controller is at the side of the cushion in a small pocket which is a nice feature. It is easily stored and has easy access to it. There are several choices and pin points on the body from the hips to the top area between the shoulders. There are also different modes of movement from deep massage to vibration. The controller has a diagram which makes it easy to select the mode wanted. It helps my back, neck and shoulder area without making me feel someone is pounding on my muscles. I love that it also has a heat element as I sometimes need a heating pad for my lower back. This is a real bonus. The cushion itself is comfortable with elastic straps that allow me to secure it to a chair. I can even use it on a gliding rocking chair. In my opinion it is ideal for a desk chair also. The unit runs on electricity but it also can be powered by a car battery with it's cigarette lighter hook-up.Snailax Shiatsu Massage Cushion with Heat Massage Chair Pad Kneading Back Massager,This thing is very powerful for the size and pricepoint. I like the functionality of it connecting to a car 12V adapter or wall outlet. we loved it for long car rides.",11149,3,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076HWNCP5

I was using a hand vac to clean it up, but our hand vac is ridiculously loud. I then switched to a short handled dust broom and dust pan, but that bothered my back. I then saw a very cheap lobby broom and dust pan set at a dollar store, and decided to order a nicer one from Amazon. (Yes, to those reviewers who thought THIS Quickie Stand set was cheap and flimsy, visit your local dollar store! In addition, there are sturdier sets than this Quickie Stand set, but they cost more money.) This lobby broom and dust pan is the perfect solution. I can easily sweep up the litter without having to bend down too far, and it folds up for easy storage. I am quite pleased, as is my back.",This makes it amazingly easy to sweep and immediately dump into the garbage,"I saw this at my sister's house in the corner by the patio door and used it to very quickly help her clean.

Pine cones that somehow got stashed in the trunk of the tricycle? Check. If you have a toddler and hardwood floors I think this is really a time saver and worth your money.After six months of it holding up famously, I decided to test drive it outdoors so I could clean up the sawdust my husband left before it rained. This made it so incredibly easy I just had to write a review. Within eight minutes all the sawdust was in the recycling bin. Again, such a huge time saver. The plastic that holds the broom to the dust pan has come lose but no biggie in my book. We always have a screwdriver close at hand.-JS",Buying 2 more should say it all,"I don't know why some people are giving this a bad review because the broom is short. It's obvious that the broom is short before you purchase it. I love this set. I bought one for my aunt who has Alzheimer's, and I came back to buy two more sets for me and my mother. I love that you can just set that dustpan aside, sweep up your mess whether it's you've pulled out a piece of furniture and you're sweeping behind it sweep up a pile and sweep it right into the dustpan without having to move the dust pan, grab a dust pan, hold the dust pan, anything. The dustpan is always sitting there waiting on you to sweep your stuff into it. I personally like to use a small room for small jobs. If I am going to sweep an entire room I will use a big broom and still use this dustpan.",A good broom set,"I ordered this set to sweep my work room at the end of the day, so I don't have to haul out the vacuum every time. It's a little bigger than I expected, but once I got used to that, I'm pleased with it. It works, the trash goes into the pan and stays there instead of spilling all over the place. The broom does a good job sweeping. And it does remain standing up once I'm done with it without flopping over. Doesn't hurt that it's a pretty blue. So a good purchase.",Very helpful for disabled,I am disabled and and cannot bend over. I use a chair in the kitchen and when I drop something on the floor it is so easy to grab (it is lightweight) and brush up the dirt. No more trying to bend over with a dustpan and brush.

It was solid to sit on for tackling lower tasks like painting, cleaning woodwork, clearing a lower freezer, organizing cabinets, reporting or planting tulip bulbs, changing outdoor lightbulbs, hanging interior and exterior decorations.

The extra step makes it a little easier to get in/out without slipping, since there's nothing near the tub to hold onto - and I'm pregnant, so I like the reassurance. We noticed the legs of our old stool were cracking, so we ordered a replacement right away. Though it still felt sturdy enough to stand on (and, really, the cracks could've been there for months; we have no idea), I didn't want to take any chances of it giving out under me. This stool works perfectly for its intended purpose. The top of the stool is smoother than our old one, and since we're using it with wet feet, we did buy a $1 non-skid tub mats and cut off a piece to fit on top.",Old style is better!,"Do you know the old saying Old style is better!

I've been searching for some time. I give it 5 stars despite it not being total perfection.I'm an average sized lady who commutes daily by bus. I also plan on using this for air travel. I got the gray bag.My must have criteria (and love!):-Great price. Got a good deal at around $50 (similar bags run around $80+ )-TSA screening ""clam shell"" design"" You simply unzip and fold the bag out in half and the laptop side is now flat and separated from the rest of the bag contents and can pass it through TSA screening without removing the laptop from the bag. Coolest invention ever! Too bad you still have to pull out your damn liquids. Some day...-The big fat soft and comfy grab handle on top- Great for carrying your bag down the bus aisle so you don't smack the crap out of your fellow bus passengers heads and shoulders wearing your backpack and turning about. (I hate when that happens... Getting smacked by people's backpacks. Be courteous, darn it! Take it off your back when you get on the bus/train/airplane, people!)-Luggage handle pass through strap thingy for your wheeled bag handle.Additional love:-Great pocket organization- Your usual stuff, pens, cards, etc. but well thought out and placed. Also the pockets don't assume you have a tiny cell phone that you don't have in a case. They are wide, so can hold any variety of things. I use the tablet pocket for bigger things like my LG bluetooth headset.... Wow, I just found two more pockets I didn't see before while writing this review.-Special pockets- Hidden pocket on the inside of the luggage handle pass through strap, great for wallet or passport as it sits against your back when wearing. Take that, pick-pocketers! Bwha ha ha! Pockets that are revealed when you open the ""clam shell"" for TSA screening where you can quick stow your passport and boarding pass or valuables. They have zips, so items stay secured. For general commuting to work, I keep my computer accessories, like flash drive, headphones, gemalto token, etc. here.-Back of backpack is padded, which is nice.-It stands up on it's own. Which makes that top grab handle even lovelier. Grab and go!Don't love:-The grey pin dot kind of makes my eyes go wonky.-Overall, boring to look at. Looks like a typical, boring backpack. Not stylish. Meh. I suppose though it is in line with the Reaction men's bags look.-Wish it was slightly lighter in color, true charcoal color. It's really dark gray, closer to black. (I'm so sick of black backpacks. Bleh.) Maybe a textile-like design vs. the teeny eye-crossing dots would be cooler. But alas. I will definitely have to put some kind of easy to identify tag on it if I use it for travel so someone doesn't mistake it for theirs.-Wish the ""cargo"" section was a little bigger/fatter. This is the big main area. I carry a lot to commute. Lunch, heels, hat, scarf, a book to read and maybe some knitting for the commute. It's pretty slim which I guess is great for folks who don't carry a lot. But for me, it's a tight fit. Which leads to...-The zippers can be kind of sticky if you have the bag packed really full. But they are still zippable one handed.-The ""fabric"" inside of the sections make an odd rustling plastic bag sound. Weird and kind of creepy. It hasn't alarmed my cats, so that's good.I can't speak to weather proof or anything like that as I just received it and have only used it for one work day. It's just I thought it was so great I couldn't wait to review it. I also haven't tried to put in a water bottle. I see the pocket. It's stretchy and also has some ventilation which would also be good for umbrellas too, but I live in Seattle and only tourists use umbrellas here. Not sure what the side pocket on the other side is even for. It unzips and is long and skinny. Huh.This backpack rocks. You should get it.",Perfect bag for business travel,"I never leave reviews but felt I needed to for all my fellow road warriors out there. I travel via car and plane. I need a bag that would serve 2 purposes, a laptop/ traveling office when driving and my personal item while flying that held the extras my carry on won't as a refuse to check bags. This bags pockets are well thought out and actually useful. It holds my laptop, all my misc office needs and chargers, my my travel handbag, tablet, 311 bag, workout clothes for 2 days, running shoes and my packable down coat. Granted I'm a pro at rolling things tight and a self proclaimed master packer. It's not as fashionable as some of the other bags I have collected in my quest for that perfect bag but practical is the name of the game. It stacks perfectly on top of my roller bag and the strap is not flimsy so it won't flip to one side when running through the airport. I'm a tuff customer and would recommend this for business travelers.",A 007 bag for all techy's,"I saw this bag on sale for $50 and purchased it.

Have hidden pockets and places to store items you dont want others to find.Finally, it has great cushion on straps to support your back and a sleeve for glasses.Like I said, this bag is for techs all over the world and James Bond would want this bag for his missions. A must buy..",I have this in two colors!,"I have this bag in blue and in black - one I carry to work every day and one for travel that stays packed with the appropriate 'stuff.' There's a crazy amount of pockets for little things and to keep organized, and the main compartment is large enough for making sure you have what you need in case your checked bag goes missing (which mine unfortunately often does). I did replace all of the zipper pulls - they are heavy and metal and don't add anything to the bag, plus you cannot lock any of them together as there is no hole in them. I bought a pack of replacement tags here on Amazon and it took me about 15 minutes to just replace them all.",Best backpack ever for work and travel...,"Amazing backpack! I have been looking for one that does it all...Laptop, tablet, miscellany, overnight clothes. This one does it all and then some. It even has a little secret pocket in the sleeve that holds it on your suitcase. Did not find that for a few weeks later...nice surprise. It also fits very comfortably on your shoulders and back.

The only difference is that the Anker Nano II is smaller due to the Gan technology. I will be using both for my needs. I do like that‚Äôs the PowerPort is slimmer and can fit between outlets easier. This Anker Nano II is pretty square. Think apple iPhone original charger. Same exact feel, except the Nano II is bigger in every way. So it‚Äôs a little more bulky. You will need to have the Nano II be one of the bigger charger ports if you have extension cords. I use GE extension cords and it has 2-3 designated larger space for larger bricks like the Nano II, and it has a handful of tighter spaces outlet for standard charger bricks or regular cords.I would definitely like it to be slimmer, but I have my PowerPort III Pod for that if needed.",Fantastic Little Charger.,"I just got mine and I already love it. I recently got a GPD WIN 3, which is a tiny little PC, and I was disappointed to see the rather large charger which, to be fair, is 65w. You can see from left to right: 65w USB C PD charger, Anker PowerPort Mini (12w + 12w USB A), Anker PowerPort PD Nano (18w USB C) and a typical phone charger (18W USB A). The Nano II is closer in size to a phone charger than a laptop oneTesting: When I plugged in both the GPD WIN 3 and a power bank, I only got 19.65 volts, even at just 1A, which is a bit low. For comparison, the white 65w charger on the comparison pics outputs 20.0 volts exactly, even at 3A. I'm not sure if the Nano II is operating in PPS mode or the voltage is simply low, but it's no big deal. Also, You can see that at 57w, the charger is drawing 63w, so it's producing 4w of waste heat (the white charger generates 5w at the same power level). Still, it is a very small charger, so it can get very hot (I haven't tested this yet).So far I'm very glad. It's a great travel charger, especially if you have other devices which charge over USB C, like an Android phone. For a UMPC like the WIN 3, or perhaps an ultrabook it's a great little charger and I recommend it highly.Update: I've been using it for about 2 months now and I still love it. I've run it at full 65w for about 40 minutes on several occasions and it has never gotten alarmingly hot. Obviously it does get pretty warm, but never to the point where I would worry about the heat. It gets about as warm as the average laptop charger.",Great for M1 MacBook Air,"I read some reviews of this being hit or miss with 65W Macbook Pros, I'm happy to report this works fine with my MacBook Air M1, it even charges at the full 65W, while in use, which is better than the 30W charger it comes with.Other reviews state that it gets ""too hot to touch"". Unfortunately I don't have a good method to measure it. I will say that while it does get warm, it is nowhere near too hot to touch. Think thick ceramic mug of coffee warm. No weird smells when it warms up either.Basically, this does what it claims and is in a tiny package. I've had some hit or miss Anker products, this is definitely not one of them. For my photos, the other charger is an older 30W Anker power adapter, and an AirPod Pro case. It weighs in at 116g. Anyway, in summary: No complaints, if you have need of a tiny 65W charger, you should definitely consider this one.",Impressively small 65W USB-PD charger,"Anker never seems to disappoint, and this Anker Nano II USB-C PD charge block is no exception.It is remarkably smaller than any other 65W charge block I have, and I've spent a fair amount of time looking for the smallest, well rated GaN charger I can find. Though some others are decently small, this Nano II puts others to shame. The one redeeming quality of the larger competition is that they usually have a selection of charge ports, allowing one to split that 65W across the available ports.While this may only have the one USB-C PD port, it's also such a smaller form factor that I feel it's more than justified having just a single port. You can plug this in and it doesn't stick up twice as high as other charge blocks, nor does it block the other plugs in the wall socket, power strip, or whatever you're plugging in to.I know the price is a little on the high side relative to the other options across Amazon (it was ~$44 when I bought it), that extra cost is well worth the unquestionably improved portability of this product. If you can afford it, I absolutely recommend this 65W Nano II if you're looking for an extremely compact and portable laptop charger. Buy it!",Works great,"After the complaints in some reviews, I decided to do a test with mine. I used my Anker Nano II 65W charger to charge my Lenovo Ideapad II convertible laptop. I have a kill-a-watt power measurement device for the 110 plug, and a handheld IR thermometer. For the cable I used the Anker Powerline III Flow, USB C to USB C Cable 100W 6ft, USB 2.0 Type C Charging Cable.Looking at power consumption, both my original laptop power supply and the Nano II performed basically the same. Both provided about 45-50 W of power to the laptop. For testing purposes, I had the laptop discharged to about 50%, running in Maximum Performance mode, and idling in a Guild Wars 2 3D scheme. They were pretty much equal in terms of charging the laptop battery percentage, so I assume the amount of actual power delivered to the laptop is the same.For heat dissipation, the Anker Nano II 65W is definitely warmer. Measuring the original power supply brick, I saw temps around 100-115 degrees F varying based on where I measured - it's fairly large so the heat depended on where I pointed. The Nano II measured about 120-125 F - Warm to the touch, but not uncomfortably so. Since it was only delivering about 50W out of the 65W it is rated, it is possible on laptops that draw more current it could get warmer. Also, we keep our house pretty cold, at about 70 F. So in warm house, in a confined area, drawing more current, it could be hotter.It is definitely smaller, about 40% of the original power supply. Even if it put out exactly the same amount of heat, being in a smaller form factor it would have a higher temperature.Overall, I feel comfortable using it in my situation. I wouldn't recommend putting it in a hot location or in an outlet with little airflow, like behind a curtain.",1347,168,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T5QN2TR

I even took the step of ordering the bike from Amazon's Warehouse Deals. I paid a very reasonable price. I am a 52 year old woman who does not really have a lot of mechanical experience, but it was a beautiful day when the bike arrived. I got my iced tea and sat on my porch with the box and spent a leisurely afternoon figuring it out. With only a little help from my husband and son (mostly to just confirm I did something correctly) I was able to assemble the bike. I'm glad I did, too, because now, adjustments make more sense to me...I know the parts and understand how they work and fit together.That said, if you are just hoping for a quick experience putting it together, you may want to get help or pay a bike shop. I rate the bike 5 stars because I love the style and I think it was a GREAT value. It seems to be working well. But for the sake of those who read reviews, here are some notes that might help you.--The color: I read a lot of reviews that complained that they were hoping for a more BLUE bike. This should be called ""Ice Blue"" or something like that, not Slate, because the bike is really a silvery blue not a darker color like I would think Slate would be.--Packaging: I ordered from Amazon Warehouse Deals, which said the item would be repackaged, so I expected that. The large box it came in was not TOO badly roughed up from shipping, but when I opened it, the inner box that was holding all the bike parts was fairly frightening. Torn spots, dents in the cardboard, etc. From reading a lot of reviews about dents, I wonder if shipping is just really hard on this. Mine came basically double boxed. I wonder if someone returned it because of the condition of the original box! The original box did not appear to ever have been opened and resealed? Anyway, I probably got lucky, but my guess is this is a shipping issue and perhaps unavoidable when you have parts, like fenders, that are easily bent out of shape.--Assembly: Yeah, there were a few head scratching moments where I had to look at the diagram, re-read and THINK, but I figured them out. I saw a YouTube video of a guy who was pretty mechanical and putting this bike together for one of his parents and he had pretty much the same issues I had! I used (after googling!) Vicks VapoRub for grease for the handlebar stem and it is working great. Did have to laugh at the whiff of menthol I got just before my second ride on it, when I adjusted the handlebars. Vaseline would work too if you don't have a tube of grease that they call for. I confirmed with a mechanical friend that this will be no problem, we're not dealing with high temperatures or huge amounts of friction. I had to really work to get fenders lined up to the holes for the bolts that hold them on, then I had to bend them into shape a little to keep them from rubbing. This is no big deal to me, but if it is to you, you're forewarned. If you can't find the stem for the seat, look inside the hole in the frame, lots of people think they don't have one then find it there! Brakes might take a while to get them adjusted properly. If any of this really doesn't sound like something you want to mess with then definitely find a handier friend or take it to a bike shop for assembly. I didn't mind the tweaking.--Riding: THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN A TWO WHEEL BIKE! You have to really remember this or you may think something is wrong when it is not. If you learned to ride a two wheel bike, you instinctively *lean* to keep balance. Leaning on this bike is not necessary and may even make your sensation of being off balance WORSE. You *might* even want to lean OUT of a turn (the opposite direction) a tiny bit! I did feel a bit wonky on this trike at first, but I just took a deep breath and tried to remember that this was different. Much better as time goes on! Also, the road where I live is slightly graded to allow rain to runoff so if I'm riding on the road, I realize that it is going to feel off balance. I only take the road for a short while, then I am on the rails-to-trails near our home. That too is ever-so-slightly graded for runoff, but I can work with it better there. If the trail is clear, I just take my spot up the middle and my fellow bikers let me know they are coming with a friendly call or ring of their bell and I move over. :)--Mount/Dismount: At first, I kept whacking the back of my legs with the back wheels. Just needed to get in the habit of remembering that unlike a 2 wheel bike, I have to watch for them.--Seat: I'm a middle aged woman with an ample middle aged figure. The seat is just *okay* for me but since I got such a nice price on the bike, I don't feel badly about seeking out a wider, more comfortable seat. Until switching the seat, I only had gone about 3 miles at a time to avoid a sore posterior.If you want a flawless, seamless experience to get up and running, look elsewhere or get professional help to assemble and fine tune. If you're willing to deal with a few little issues, you'll have a great trike at a great price.","Solid Bike, Excellent support.  I recommend this product.",My doctor recommended riding a bike to help loose weight. I weigh 410lbs and honestly expected the tires to blow as soon I I sat down for the first time. The held fine and I have been on multiple rides now with this bike and the only trouble I have had is with the seat not staying put. Kinda leaves you feeling like Hitler in the move Little Nicky. Well a wider seat with additional rear support is coming so hopefully that will resolve the seat issue. I did have to call customer service because I had a bolt that will not fully tighten but they have sent a replacement and I must say I was impressed with the treatment I got from them. Well done.,"Heavy trike, but soooo worth the price","This bike is amazingly awesome!I was born with a genetic disorder (EDS) that has my bones aging three times as fast as my body. That being said even at only 24 I have MAJOR joint problems, including a sprained PCL, but I wanted something that would be easy on my bones while helping me keep active. I received this as a Christmas present from my mom- AKA she gave me her card and said buy yourself a trike. I did not want to buy something super expensive and at the time this was on sale for about $275, so my mom agreed it would be good for the price.The shipping was fast and I was not home when it arrived, luckily my apartment maintenance guys love me because it was in my third floor apartment when I got home from my trip. This box is heavy- it took two guys to carry it up three flights. I have a 100 pound dog who I carry fifty pounds of dog food up three flights of stairs every two weeks, and yet I still found myself scooting the box around the apartment because of its heaviness.I could not put this bike together- I took it apart three times over a week before a co-workers husband took it during his bonding night with his son and put it together in less than three hours. I have always been handy challenged, but I would still recommend not spending the money on labor and just bring someone handy the bike, some beer, and a pizza because it is do-able.Once it was put together, it was still too heavy to bring back upstairs daily, so if you don't live in a trusty neighborhood take that into consideration.As for the riding, I LOVE this bike because it's super easy to ride. So far my longest ride was 12 miles with a 300ft elevation- in total during the past few months this bike has seen me through a total of over 50 miles and 700ft elevation in weather up to 100 degrees plus humidity- and this bike has held up. I ride to the store all the time, load up one of my five gallon bins with $100 worth of groceries, stick it in the basket, and ride home easily. I live in a very humid extremely hilly area of south Texas, and this bike handles both the hills and my weight extremely well.When I received this bike I did not like the seat and upgraded to one without a horn, which I do suggest looking into.I was 5.4 and 220 pounds when I received this bike, and have already lost 10 pounds by riding this bike for fun. This was my first bike ever, and I didn't know how to ride the first time I got on this bike, yet I have never fallen nor crashed- even coasting down a steep hill at 10mph. I would highly recommend this bike for older adults who have bone issues like myself, mobility challenged individuals, or anyone who wants a cargo type trike that is easy on the ecosystem. If this bike ever fails me, I would not even think twice about spending the asking price for this trike, it has quickly become my child and new favorite hobby.",This bike is perfect for him,"We bought this bike for our 9 year old son who has autism. Riding a regular bike is a skill that he just hasn't been able to master yet. I think it's sensory overload and bikes in the size he would need, they don't have training wheels. This bike is perfect for him! He can balance on it, put his toys or stuffed animals in the basket, and most importantly, he loves it! The instructions to put it together were a little complicated, but all in all, it's awesome!",Go Grammy Go!,"I just love my Schwinn Trike! I got it mainly to take my dog a ride with as he knocked me off my two wheel bike and I'm way to old for that! I rigged up a tube to run his leash through to where it keeps him at bay and unable to run around the bike . He actually pulls me and I just go through the motions of pedaling. It was so worth the investment I made for this. It is so much safer for what I wanted and needed . The basket is handy as well. I like to take pictures so my camera case and camera rides well in it. Plus if I were to go to the store I could easily carry groceries back home in it. But mainly I just got it for my dog Buddy and I for evening and early morning runs! I would recommend this to any one over the age of, too old to fall off a two wheeler! I'm 65, female and I assembled it myself. Had a few issues like I had the fork turned around backwards so the fender didn't really fit right but once we figured out the problem it was an easy fix!",4489,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009M3PC72

I even tried sitting on a shiatsu massager, which helped some while I sat on it, although it was uncomfortable at times and I couldn't sit on it continuously. I searched for a seat cushion, but I was hesitant to spend a lot of money, especially if it wasn't going to really help. I saw this one and thought it was inexpensive enough to give a try. It came on time and was exactly as pictured. I tried it for a couple of hours on my day off and thought it was ok. The next day I had to work a full day and a couple of hours longer than usual.

I was actually going to purchase their original ""classic"" design when I saw that the newer design has this feature.

It appears this is the newer 2nd Get version of the rotating flat plug, as the outlet hub now incorporates a closed hook. While minor change, it makes a big difference in my circumstance. I power a circulating fan that will sit on top of my fridge (summer). The flat plug doesn't restrict me from pushing the fridge close to the wall... and it runs straight up and held on the wall by small finishing nail. Easy to plug/unplug my fan & the extended outlet stays in place at all times... and never falls behind the fridge when not in use. Very pleased.","If you are short on outlets, this is what you need.","Love this and it took me awhile to find it! I bought a picture light that needed to be plugged into wall not a power strip. Only one double outlet below behind my buffet and the light had a large square plug for remote control. I still needed 2 outlets for a lamp and our phone and nothing worked with the picture plug to leave room for an outlet for a power strip. THIS did the trick! The plug wire can be moved to up, down or to the side and the box fit below it, now I have 3 places to plug in other things and use the picture light too. Thrilled!",Rating matches coffee maker for safety,This cord is exactly what we need to operate our Nepresso coffee maker in our RV. The rating matches the coffee maker‚Äôs requirement and it reaches over the window to hang in the correct spot in our small class B RV kitchen. We don‚Äôt want the chance of a fire by using a cord not rated for the power the coffee maker needs 16awg. The flat rotating plug lies flat against the outlet by the door. A projecting plug at that entrance could be problematic.,Perfect cord,"Just what I needed. With all my small appliances, I needed a one place where I could have my coffee maker, hot water carafe, espresso maker and frother in one corner of my kitchen counter. This was just right length for all of them to be plugged in one wall plug without another long cord snaking along the wall. It came well packed and delivered in time.",1045,150,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VS76N98

It has pockets and zippers and snap compartments, for literally everything: wallet, keys, Chapstick, pens and pencils, a laptop, chargers, lotions, an umbrella, notebooks and binders - I am in love with this thing!!! Everything is well put together in the sense of organization, where the pockets are laid out, and how. I can keep my keys and work badge upfront and easy to access in the front zipper, and my wallet even has its own pocket, too, closer to the middle of the backpack, so not so easy to get to which is nice for deterring thieves!

The quilted pocket adds a touch of elegance. It is plenty roomy, and unlike some backpacks, does not collapse in on itself when it isn't full. It has plenty of inner pockets but not so many that you forget where you put things. I highly recommend this bag.",Great backpack!,"I really love this backpack.

This backpack holds everything that was in the laptop bag, plus a lot more. It is comfortable to wear (I use both shoulder straps). I traveled abroad with it and used it to hold my shopping items when going through markets.The only downside are the pockets on the outside on each of the sides that look like they could hold beverages. They really can't unless its a small beverage container and as long as your bag is not full. I was able to get a bottle of water from the airport to fit in it. But once my bag had a lot of stuff in it, I couldn't use it for a beverage. Maybe use it for little papers (assuming they won't fly out).",4451,647,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077PPDB9M

Greatest item I‚Äôve ever had!,"Great Seller and fast delivery. Honestly, this RK61 is a incredible wireless compact mechanical keyboard. Brown switch is good for office and home using.I would like to give everyone a tip. If you want to use arrow keys, you only need to press Fn+shift at the same time and then only press any arrow keys, you would find the arrow keys can work. Remember, you don't need to press Fn+ shift+up key at the same time. Pressing Fn+shift means open this RK61 keyboard between first function and second funtion.

At this condition, you can press shift+/, the ? would appear.",get this keyboard... NOW,,Budget Mech KB That Performs Just As Good!,"This is definitely one of the top 3 budget keyboards I'd definitely recommend especially if you're looking for a small or minimal 60% look or simply don't need the functionality of the function row or numpad. When purchasing make sure you know what kind of switches you want because you have the option of linear reds, tactile browns, or clicky blues. I went with browns since I've used reds before, but felt a little too light for me to the touch. I included 2 pictures with different keycaps. The first pic has some HyperX pudding keycaps, and the second pic are the keycaps it comes with along with a 10 CMYK keycap set, similar to what comes with the Anne Pro 2 60% keyboards. This is definitely worth it. I only wish that it came with at least Outemus or Gaterons instead of their proprietary RK switches, but if you want you can purchase the ones you want, as long as it's compatible with the pcb, and do some soldering. I also did lube the stabilizers, as recommended by some, to negate the ping-y sound that may reverberate when pushing on the keys that have stabilizers (shift, enter, and especially spacebar). I used dielectric grease that I purchase at a local autozone (you can also find it at home depot, or any hardware or auto store), that only cost me $1 during a sale, but only normally $5 or less. Do this and you'll have an amazing 60% mechanical keyboard. The RGB's aren't too dim and actually brighter than the ones I had on a previous Tecware Phantom 87 TKL. I love the led patterns on this a lot, but you can also turn them off if you want to. The wireless and bluetooth functionality on this keyboard is also very easy to use. Make sure you read the manual! It'll have the commands/inputs you need if your keyboard does not automatically pair to the device you want. You can pair it up to 3 devices such as your Pc, Ipad, and/or Iphone or anything with bluetooth functionality. I usually use this wired since it's specifically for gaming, but I can see this being of use as a portable wireless keyboard on the go since it is only a 60%. I've only found one issue that might of been on my end, and that was when I tried using a cheapo usb that had leds on this versus the one it came with, or one of decent quality. The usb I tried using was mostly for aesthetics since it blinked blue/red leds, but was also just cheap and gimmicky. Other than that I have had know issues, and I've own this for a few months now. If anything changes I will update this review.","Amazing Keyboard, great customer service, too small.","I've used this keyboard for a little while now and I love it so much, but it's my first 60% board and I just couldn't get into it. The RGB is amazing, it has some of the best looking lighting I've seen on a RGB keyboard, the preset RGB settings are awesome and can be really customized even without using the software. The FN bindings are keyboard layout changes took me while to get the hang of. I feel that is product of it being a 60% KB rather than anything with RK, because I even looked at the ""holy grail"" Anne Pro 2 and it has annoying keybindings to get over it's small size too. I never had any issues with delay, keys not working, functions not binding, I mean overall this was a very nice keyboard. This was my first experience with brown switches, they're really nice, I like the tactile feeling but overall I think I'm mostly into blue switches even thought they're loud.The bad: I just couldn't get used to using a 60% KB. If you're like me and have used a full size KB or even an 87 key for your whole like a switch to a 61 key is rough. Even using an ancillary number-pad I found myself annoyed with it. Ultimately, this is a gaming keyboard, which is does very well, but I had to work from home on my rig a few times with this keyboard and I was pissed. I don't feel like that should detract from my rating of this product though, because most people hopefully know what they're getting into.TL:DR if RK makes a full 104 or 108 KB I'd buy it without question since this KB was so nice. I jsut can't get used to a 60% KB.",6087,584,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PC117G5

Looks impressive for the 80 bucks I paid.",Great media cabinet but...,"This is a great-looking, sturdy media cabinet. I'm using it to store my collection of video games, and the tempered glass adds quite a bit of class to the overall look. My only problem is that it was missing 3 wooden dowels and 2 screws when I assembled it. Luckily I had a few in my toolbox that worked, but it's still irritating when the instructions say it comes with (for example) 20 dowels and 20 screws, and when I organize the included parts, there are only 17 and 18 respectively. I would think of all the pieces included, wooden dowels and screws would have 1 or 2 EXTRA, not MISSING. Otherwise, its a beautiful media cabinet. Just plan on a trip to the hardware store.","Cabinet is quite heavy, sturdy and a good value","This DVD cabinet is quite heavy and, as a result, is very sturdy. We have it on a hardwood floor and it doesn't wobble at all. We would add to the other comments that the DVD storage capacity could be improved if the manufacturer would re-position the shelf support holes. As it is currently, you can only use four of the six adjustable shelves if you're planning to use the case 100% for DVDs resulting in a lot of ""empty"" space that's not usable. You could lay some DVDs flat-side down in the empty space and pile them up I guess to store a few more. Kudos to the manufacturer for separating all the little screws, dowels and cams in separate plastic bags with clear identification in stead of one large bag with a hundred pieces. I would have given the case a 5-star review if not for a couple of nagging assembly issues. The first was that two pieces were mislabeled and, unfortunately it was the two that were used in Step 1. So while I'm trying to get used to the pictorial assembly instructions, it didn't help that I was trying to complete Step1 on the wrong piece. No wonder it didn't fit. And secondly, there are a number of tiny Phillips screws used in the assembly and the pre-drilled starter holes were not very deep. Not a problem if the screws were of the self-tapping variety. My forearm got tired trying to get these screws to bite and I had to resort to using a drill to create better starting holes for them. Otherwise, the assembly was straight-forward.",Very Pleased with DVD storage,"Extremely pleased with this product. Took a chance and ordered 2 of them because I needed storage for about 400 DVDs. Product details noted that you could store 192 DVDs on each. I was able to put 49 single case DVDS on each of the 4 main shelves, so 196 total (plus room for about 30 more on smaller shelves if you place horizontally. ) There is one fixed shelf in the middle for stability and they provide six additional (allows for CDs and smaller items) but I just used four extra shelves, as I needed proper height for DVDs. Sliding glass doors move smoothly (can be adjusted per directions if necessary). Overall I think it looks great. Assembly was pretty easy (about 1/2 hour) by following directions provided. All parts and hardware were labeled. Only tool tricky to use was the small makeshift ""screwdriver"" provided as even with my small hand the grip was tricky, otherwise all good. Very good value especially when compared to similar items out there which I did plenty of before buying these. Very happy with purchase and don't hesitate to recommend.",1678,235,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035HSHBY

That's what I thought, anyway. Nothing prepared me for the truth.Do you remember the year 1995? I remember it a little. Irony was the realm of artists, not memes. When you said the word grit, folks still thought about John Wayne instead of grade school programs. Modernity had only partially wiped us of ourselves, the Internet was still only barely there. Social media was nowhere to be found, we still spoke to one another like people. It was a simpler time before we all became cyborgs, but a time of widespread ignorance as well. Sort of like the time before I found this dustpan.But also in 1995, AOL was king. America was coming online, but hardly anyone knew what that meant. No one could have predicted where it would go. The advent of the Internet was one of those world-shattering moments that changed everything. Sort of like a few weeks ago, when I ordered this dustpan.When it arrived, it wasn't packed in one of those matte finish, sleek boxes you get with Apple products. But it wasn't the packaging that sold me. Just a dustpan in a heavy paper jacket. It was like any other dustpan, or so it seemed. When you're holding a dustpan, you don't expect much. 2019, 1995, 1975, it doesn't really matter. It doesn't seem like dustpan technology advanced that far in 30 years. But then I used THIS dustpan.You've probably been using dustpans your whole life and never thought about what is too narrow or too wide, bristles that are too long or too short, the rigidity of the brush stroke, the angle of the handle, or any of that. You grabbed some random dustpan, probably the peasant garbage included with your broom, and rolled with it.But OXO had a different idea. They set out to revolutionize the dustpan and they did.Remember using a plastic or metal dustpan where all you could do was brush in about 80% of the material while the rest of it slid underneath?Say goodbye to that. This dustpan has a rubber edge that is just the right amount of firm and flexible. It meets the surface, conforms, and captures everything.As you draw your brush across the floor, the bristles are so soft and so gentle that you barely know when they touch, but an inch or two into the bend, the resistance is just right to let you know it's time to hold it steady on the pull. The result? No splayed-out bristles. No springboard-style kick back that sends your crumbs across the room.I could go on and on. The angle of the handle is just right. The way the brush fits into the pan feels like German engineering.I've never had a bad experience with this. Not once. It's a joy to use and I mean that. Bad day? Top off a cathartic cleaning session with this brush pan and you never lose that cleaners high.I thought this was just a brush pan. I wasn't prepared for this. It is a brush pan. But so much more.Five. Stars.",Why I now own FOUR of these!,"I love this so much that I now own four of them! (car, kitchen, workbench in garage, camper). The bristles are close together so that it even sweeps up tiny particles. Love that the brush fits tightly into dustpan for those times you cannot empty it immediately (Ex: spill in vehicle). Love the small size since many times you cannot fit a large dustpan where are cleaning. Love that you can rinse the bristles and give it a shake and the brush is clean again. I've had this for quite some time. This morning ""unfortunately"" I knocked over a very large ornate glass vase in my bathroom. It hit the tile and shattered into so many pieces. Also knocked over a 24 ounce glass of water so the tiny shards were in a lot of water. Needed to get the glass up before I could dry the floor and run the vacuum. So glad I had this little dustpan. Was able to get almost all the shards up with this brush/dustpan so that I didn't have to worry about cutting myself wiping up the water. This is so handy for quick clean up in my vehicle. The one in my kitchen is used ""only"" in the kitchen. Great for sweeping up crumbs before wiping off counters. Just wish I had discovered these sooner!",Great For Home & The Classroom,First of all - my kitten was able to balance the mini broom and pass NASA‚Äôs broom challange!I absolutely love my little broom. It is so functional that I ordered 3 more for my kindergarten classroom. My students love their turn to be the class ‚Äúsweeper.‚Äù,Better than I imagined a dustpan/brush could be!,"I love this little dustpan/brush combo! We have 11-month-old triplets which means I can often be found on the floor of restaurants picking up pieces of food and torn up napkins with my hands... or at least I could until we got this product. We keep it in the diaper bag and after a meal we whip it out and clean up the floor in no time. When I went in search of a whisk broom for cleaning up after our hooligans, I expected to get an awkwardly shaped brush that I stored in a grubby plastic bag, but this clever little brush (with the handle to the side so it's not huge - bonus) clicks tightly into the dustpan and does not shed crap all over the inside of our bag. The bristles stay nice and straight since they're protected, too. The rubber edge lays flat on the ground so even tiny items are easy to sweep up. I've rinsed the whole thing under water after a messy meal and it dried nicely and didn't hold water. I'd easily pay twice or three times what I paid for this, I love it that much. I might get another or three for around the house - I bet the triplets will love their own little brooms - my house will never be so clean! If you're thinking of getting a dustpan/brush and are on the fence, stop looking and get this one.",BEST BRUSH/PAN FOR TINY SPECS OF CAT LITTER!!,"I have cats with littler boxes on both tile and wood floors. They constantly scatter litter all over, even though I have a mat outside the boxes. Nothing worse than litter tracked all over. And I don‚Äôt want to keep a tall unsightly broom sitting out. I have tried many different small brush/pan setups like this over the years. BUY THIS ONE! Do not waste any more time or money on any other. I read a great review on this one and decided to try it, and they were so right, this one is amazing. I bought the bigger one. It never misses, I never have littler left because it didn‚Äôt slide over the rubber and into the pan, this brush and pan picks up every single tiny piece of litter the first time. I don‚Äôt have to try over and over to get the litter into the pan, it brushes right in without any effort - this is amazing. You will not be disappointed, best little brush/pan ever!",18758,2,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00940DUF4

I just want to share my experiences.First, WiFi antenna is not that good. Thankfully it comes with USB ports. so use USB instead. USB cable not included though. I think all Epson printers have the same issue.Second, Ink tank quickly drains than you expected. even while it's cleaning ink head you can see the ink gauge is decreasing quite rapidly. So, you should keep an extra replacement ink bottle. however you could see the ink bottle is all sold out from amazon. now you know why.Third. Paper is top loading. this printer is quite compact. width is just a little longer than 11"" letter size paper. (14.8"") but you see the depth is 22.8"" which is longer than the width. because this is the top loading printer, you will need way more space than what it says(I mean more than 22.8""). otherwise you will easily have some paper jam.Ah one more thing. You must to do paper alignment before you use it!!! if you don't do this you will see white lines on your printing. When you install the printer it will guide you to do it. just follow the direction then you will be fine.",The ins and outs of Epson ET-2720,"As I write this, the ET-2720 is new. It's a supertank (aka, reservoir) printers that's considered greener for the planet while saving big bucks for consumers. It's not perfect, but I think it's worth it.Most people want to hear the bad news first, so let's get that outta the way. The paper capacity is really small, for plain copy paper no more than 30 sheets. And here's how you load the paper. Flip open the narrow feeder guard from the rear of the top of the machine. Then slide the edges out. Take a look at the 5th product photo to see what it looks like with the feeder guard out.If you're a glutton for bad news, hear this. The stated printing speed for color is 5 ppm, and for black is 10.5 ppm. This isn't the best all-in-one for those with 100 page print jobs, in my opinion. Now let's offset this with good news.* You get started with lots of ink. For the average home, it'll be a long time before ordering more ink.* The ink is easy and safe to load. And it feels wonderful to be cartridge-free.* Print quality is excellent to say the least, with highly legible text that's appropriate for most businesses and personal use. Also, its color photo quality printing is superior to laser jet printers at anything like the same cost.* Long-term cost is widely variable depending on many factors such as humidity, and it's far superior to any printer that uses cartridges.* The control panel is intuitive whether one controls the device there or on a phone or computer, and easy to use, in my view.* This printer is well-documented with a 220-page user manual that's available as PDF online. This user manual is written in correct and plain language, demonstrating quality editing that's expected from Epson or any of its peers.* Originated (whatever that really means) in Philippines.I believe this color all-in-one printer is a very good choice for a home printer that everybody at home can learn to use. Epson concentrates its strength and targets this market segment, those who want a reservoir, or supertank, printer for a couple hundred dollars. It certainly beats any cartridge printer, in my opinion. It certainly beats printer models that use subscription services for ink cartridges, which I consider to be a bad deal for subscribers.It's better to go with a reservoir (aka, supertank) printer for economics and because they're greener than using cartridges. This Epson printer works well even though it has a small plain copy paper load capacity.",Amazing print quality,"Let‚Äôs start off with the fact that I am so glad I bought this printer. My whole life I have used an inkjet printer with those ridiculously priced cartridges and enough was enough. I am a college student in a STEM field so I print pretty much everyday roughly 10-70 pages depending on my assignments.Printer comes sealed and taped down very nicely and safely. It comes with the cord to connect it and turn it on, the packets with instructions and the cd, and the four bottles of ink. No the CD is not necessary for setting up via WiFi, also your WiFi needs to be atleast 2.4GHz in order for this to work. Setting it up through the computer didn‚Äôt work for us so we just did it through the printer, the manual entry was a bit tedious but only necessary the one time and now we can print from anywhere around the house.The set up is pretty self explanatory, follow the steps on the paper and you‚Äôll be set, don‚Äôt cut corners because the printer does need to register the ink and everything in order to work properly. Do the ink first before turning it on! While there‚Äôs ink in the printer do not flip it.When you fill up the ink you should be left with maybe 2-3 ml but after the whole setup is done you can fill the rest of it up and throw the bottles away. Once everything is being setup, for the best ink quality you‚Äôre going to want to do the setup which will use a bit of your ink but it‚Äôs worth it, it‚Äôs going to print out different boxes and ask which ones are the better quality. This is important for good printing quality!Printer quality is awesome, we did the setup and took our time with it and it prints great! I don‚Äôt see anything wrong so far with it, and like I previously mentioned it has been a very pleasant purchase. I‚Äôm glad I switched to this type of printer, If you‚Äôre debating it still...I think you should do it! Thanks for tuning in to this long but hopefully helpful review :)!",Best home printer!,"I struggled to find a ""con"" to this printer. I'd say - if you're looking for photo-quality printer, you need to spend more money, and you can only load like 20 or so pages of paper at a time. Neither of those things was enough for me to take a star of - I don't expect photo quality at this price point, and my previous HP held about the same amount of paper.So, Pros:Ink tanks! YAY! no more crappy cartridges that dry up and jam up and run out in a couple of weeks. These are easy to fill, and appear to be a lot less expensive per hundred pages than cartridges. Even going a week without printing, the quality on the first page was as good as it was the first time I printed.Setting it up was dead easy. It's much simpler to fill the ink tanks than to replace the cartridges on my old HP. The instructions are easy to understand and follow, and I had it set up and working in maybe ten minutes with zero cussing at the wireless connection. Connecting it to my laptop to print was just as simple, and worked the first time without any fumbling.The display is very straightforward and easy to use - but you can also control it from your cell phone.In all, great value, great price! Nice job, Epson.",Life Saver!,"I teach 2nd grade and I‚Äôm constantly printing for my classroom. I have printed over 1,000 copies so far and I have barely made a dent in my ink levels. Very user friendly and the print quality is amazing! Highly highly recommend this printer.",8533,849,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PW3Q92W

The rings started to get stuffed and it was getting harder to turn the pages. I couldn't figure out why. Then, it all of a sudden dawned on me. It was the 28lb paper I recently upgraded to in my planner.I came online and found this 18lb paper. I did some research and found a gentleman who used the 16lb to create more room. However, that option is no longer available. The 18lb did just as well. I absolutely love it! I reprinted all of my notes and inserts with the 18lb and I couldn't be happier. It created so much room. No, it doesn't have the silky feel of 28lb paper. But my planner is for function and to help me be productive. I highly recommend reducing the weight of your paper if you are running out of room in your planner.",Great For General Printing,"Sometimes you just HAVE to print and sometimes you just have to print a lot of pages. If just 1 or 2 sheets, 18 lbs doesn't seem like much of a difference from your typical 20 or 24 lbs. But when you're printing and having to carry 10 or 20 sheets, it adds up. Not just regarding weight, but also with how difficult it is to staple, clip, or fit into a sleeve or folder. Then there's disposal, thin paper is easier to dispose of as well. Tearing this paper also requires deliberate action, it's not going to fall apart on you. You can see the print on the other side a bit, it's about the same as any 20 lb office paper. Normal day-to-day printing, this paper is very good.",Good alternative,"I was looking for the thinnest paper possible to print books and avoid the overall size. This paper is satisfactory for my needs. If shipping, you will also pay less for shipping due to the lighter weight. I'm convinced. I will not buy regular bond paper again.

I ended up covering the front, back and spine with adhesive vinyl. I like it that I don't have to worry about the notebooks ending up gross.

Great way to be creative.",Firm paper good for mixed media bullet journaling.,"I really like this notebook! I am using it for my BuJo and am finding it to make a great weekly spread. I typically use watercolor before using gel pens or other writing medium to make my weekly spreads and would caution that it's not great for watercolor, since the paper is obviously not for watercolor painting. Nonetheless, I like the thick paper feel for a bujo, natural paper color and Kraft paper cover with elastic. Also, this paper is no good for alcohol markers - these markers bleed through the paper. (I rarely use them but had to test.) Good journal probably for mixed media and junk journaling.",Excellent!,I just started this journal and love how it opens flat.

You can remove a part from the dustpan and create a larger broom handle but then the dustpan is too short. I feel they missed the boat of having it come with 1 more extension to make it an option of a longer broom. Also the bristles permanently bend when putting it back into the dustpan and locking in place for storage. It is very annoying to have several bristles be perpendicular to the broom when removing it. Over time, more and more bristles become perma-bent proving to be annoying. I may just have to cut them off.UPDATE:March 2019 - I was emailed based on my review and provided a sturdier version of the product WITH extensions. I am extremely pleased.

I only have to sweep the debris into it ONE time, rather than the 'ole backup-sweep-backup dance. It's refreshing!One criticism is that the handle section of the pole comes unscrewed easily, but some threadlocker is a quick fix for that. They call the handle portion an ""extension"", but really it just brings the broom to a good height for a normal person. The dustpan handle is a little shorter, I'm 5'6 and it comes to my upper abdomen. Still plenty of height for easy use, but the picture makes it seem like the pan & broom match up, by treating the ""extension pole"" as an accessory (you're going to want it on).",16853,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CNQBPCG

I'm most impressed with the strength of it. It has three different strengths of vibration and I feel like the medium is more than enough.

Being tall nothing is ever made for you so I'm not going to ding them for it, just figured someone might find that information useful.Other than that, everything else seems pretty standard and works. It has a bunch of different modes where it does different patterns of vibration. You can also just turn on different sets of massagers individually to where they just run a solid vibration that doesn't change. That's what I normally use as the patterns just aren't my thing. I posted a picture of one page of the manual explaining the different modes with the remote. It shuts off after 30 minutes.The heat settings are just warm not hot. In the manual it states it's not meant to be a heating pad. I actually like that it's not real hot, but if you're looking for high heat out of a massager cushion I would say this isn't the one for you.I had a lot of muscle pain in my upper back and shoulder area the last couple weeks which is why I got this. It was one of those things I just couldn't seem to stretch out the tightness that was leading to the pain.

Sitting at my desk was excruciating and only got worse with time. I couldn't find any comfort no matter how many ways I contorted myself. My wife told me to purchase this complete massager/heating pad. Oh my goodness! I set the massaging and heat to focus on my lower back and posterior and felt almost immediate relief. Comfier makes the best built, most versatile seat cushion massager/heating pad I've ever seen. I highly recommend it's use both in the office and the car.",Your personal masseuse,First of all great upgrade to my car. My car seats are not heated ones and by simply adding this massager seat I upgraded my car seats to heated one! It works really well and different vibrator settings are great for your back and you can easily select your favorite settings using remote. I have been using this seat in my car from last couple of weeks and I would suggest getting this upgrade at such affordable price.,Best Bang for your Buck$ !,I just had emergency surgery In July.

With 5 preprogrammed massage cycles along with the ability to just isolate any or all of the 5 pairs of massage discs and your choice of 3 massage vibration strengths this product really gets to the source of your pain.

It's more then powerful to blow all the loose sawdust off of my wood working projects and equipment. The battery life is great, I have used it for at least 20-30 minutes without needing to recharge it. It's not quiet but it's not that noisy either certainly in the shop and around the house.","This may seem expensive, but well worth it.","I received this Air Duster first thing this morning and I‚Äôve been using it a lot. The first thing I did was blow off all of my woodworking tools as quite a bit of sawdust had accumulated in and around the machines. The air duster had no problems getting all that sawdust out. I then went to project number two where I am refurbishing an old loung chair that had been sitting outside for a while. I had already dusted and cleaned the chair, or so I thought. I used the air gun to blow loose all the debris in between all the little crevices and it worked great. I also used it to blow dust off some artificial flowers that we have indoors. The air compressor worked great and I ran it for several minutes continuously...never a problem. . In my opinion, it blows enough air with enough power to get the results you want. I would even say that it‚Äôs air power is just as good as the can version. The only reason the can version seems more powerful, is because it uses a very thin straw to blow the air through. The straw condenses the air and it looks like it‚Äôs blowing harder. The problem with the can version is that you can only use them in short burst before the can gets ice cold and it stops blowing. This little air duster runs for as long as you need it. I‚Äôm happy I made the purchase.",Nice size and exquisite,"This air duster is very strong and useful as my keyboard is kinda old so it is not water proof, I used to just use a q tip and wipe it which is very time consuming. Ever since I got this the whole process is easier.","You can ""double-click"" and it'll stay blowing!","I've had one of these at the office (accessible to IT techs) for a while and really liked it, just found it too expensive. At home I was using a more expensive, heavy-duty canister blower. Over time I realized that I really hated getting out the blower at home, plugging it in, selecting an attachment/tip, etc. It was just overkill for the simple tasks. So I bit the bullet and got one of these for home. It's great! Last weekend I had to unpack a UPS and move it to the wall at my teenager's computer/gaming space, while moving a larger UPS to the main rack. Usually this type of move, where I'm moving stuff around that's been sitting in place for a while, means I'll blow out the power supply and vent areas of any equipment, and dust off the stuff being moved, mounted or relocated. I actually reach for a can of compressed air before I remembered this item. Grabbed it instead and it was as convenient and practical as I hoped.Unmentioned in the item description or content list was a blower brush that was included and which was very useful.And I finally glanced at the little instruction booklet which I'd never bothered to even glance at because the thing has just one damned button to press to blow stuff - what's to know? Well, it turns out that one of the few minor issues with this thing was that I had to hold the button down for a couple seconds to start it blowing and then hold the button to keep that air going. Let go, no no blow. And guess what? There's a no-hold, keep-blowing mode! Just double-squeeze the button/trigger and it starts blowing immediately and stops with one touch of the button. Always read the **** manual.",stop wasting money on canned air,"I started to chafe at the cost of canned air for cleaning off the pictures and slides I'm archiving, as well as my desk and keyboard. I mean, aren't we surrounded with air -- it should be fairly cheap, right?! Not to mention the wastefulness of shipping cans and the slightly smelly propellant which might not even be good for you. Enter the rechargeable air blower. This was well worth the money. I have would have probably gone through countless cans by now, and this thing works like a charm. It isn't *quite* as powerful as the short blasts you get from canned air, but I use the brush adaptor to compensate, and am very happy. Thanks!",1864,173,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083GMMB5C

Car detailing, cleaning wheels etc","First. Traxion is a great company. I had the issue that some have reported with the hydraulic cylinder appearing to have failed after just a few hours of minimal use. I'm not a small guy, but we'll under the 400lb weight limit. I sent them an email late one evening, they called first thing the next morning and a few days later I had a newly redesigned seat bottom with lever and new hydraulic cylinder. The seat base on the new one appears to be made out of heavier gauge steel, and a redesigned lever. The problem on mine was the button on top of the hydraulic cylinder was pushing against the lever which was pinned against the bottom of the seat. It went up when I got up, but down as soon as I put any weight on it.Secondly, it's AWESOME. It's let me sit in my garage for more than just a few, not several minutes on my old round seat, craftsman. I have major lower back issues with a lumbar fusion and nerve root scaring and damage with no options but Pain Management. I only share this because for the past 7+ years I was unable to enjoy much of anything related to my passion for working on cars. I've found different tools that have allowed me to do different things, but this is near the top of the list, and probably my favorite thing. It obviously didn't fix the issue, but has allowed me some much needed time in my garage, or shop. I will buy another for my shop once it's cooler.It's easy to roll around on concrete, it will go over air hoses and extension cords, but it's not easy for me. I tried it once, but it's just easier to kick it out of the way with my good leg or cane. It actually goes lower than my craftsman with 2"" casters, go figure. The tray is helpful holding stuff, you just have to make sure it's not taller than the seat in its lowest setting if you plan to use the adjustability, otherwise you can ruin something, or make a big mess. I learned this the hardware with an expensive bottle of liquid. Luckily I had just cleaned the tray and was able to salvage most of it.If your situations is even remotely similar to mine, stop reading reviews and just buy it, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed unless you plan to use it on unpacked substrate or mud. I have not tried it on gravel, only fairly smooth hard material such as concrete and tile. BTW, i worked great inside the house as well, it allowed me to change a few cabinet hinges that HAD been broken for years. And my 7 year old enjoys it.",Quality - what a difference!,"Not only a quality product that's well made, it's properly sized (possibly a touch large), stable, plus comfortable. Replaces a very cheap $30 product that was totally the opposite, plus tippy, which had miserable wheels suitable only for glass-smooth surfaces. The casters on this unit are exceptional which is the key element toward functional use. A well designed product, an attribute that one doesn't experience often; far too many products of any type or stripe are over-hyped and in reality come up short on delivery. This Traxion product deserves a Six-Star rating. If the covering proves durable it should last almost a lifetime... and a pleasure to use each time it is used.",Useful for someone with mobility issues.,"I was looking for a low rolling stool because of mobility issues related to joint replacements. I have used it outside for working on our patio and flowerbeds and inside for pedicures, polishing lower cabinets and cleaning bathrooms. I left off the red tray, which does not need to be installed. That has made it more comfortable to roll around on and more useful in maneuvering in small spaces such as the bathroom. The wheels are very substantial which is why I can use it outside. So far, this has been an excellent purchase!",Brilliantly comfy,"We've been using an old basic mechanics stool for ten years and when one of the wheels broke off after heavy usage and abuse, I welded it back on. It is small and sad but still works in those tight spaces and when you kick it away, it doesn't fall apart. It just bounces off whatever it hits and secretly wants me to keep it buy being useful on the concrete. Needless to say its time to upgrade.I never knew what a luxury stool felt like until today. The old mechanics stool had lost its softness in the bum and I have actually slid off of it a few times due to no support and hurrying to get things done. NOW, thanks to this new stool, I wont be sliding off and it doesn't feel like I'm sitting on concrete.Keep in mind this is a larger stool so you won't be able to use it in those small hard to reach spaces but you wont regret buying this for a couple of reasons. One, its extremely comfortable and two, the large casters roll way better than the tiny ones from a smaller stool. The quality of the stool is great however I would probably use a thicker plastic for the tray as this one is a bit thin but if your not putting cinder blocks on it then it is certainly adequate. It has a smaller divider part in the try which is nice for nails and screws so that is a bonus as not everything on the tray is rolling around with the smaller bits.I'm holding off on the 5 star rating of the sturdiness and only gave it 4 stars bc I just got this last night and am using it today to start the new kitchen and want to see how this holds up.So far, WOW. My back and bum thank you Traxion!",Very well made and very well designed.,"Best creeper seat I've ever used. The wheels are large and widely spaced. It glides the best I've used, even over rough surfaces. The seat is very comfortable and of course adjustable. The 10.1"" dimension listed is for the 'unassembled in a box' dimension. That's the size of the box it comes in. The tool tray is the largest of any creeper seat out there. I read all the negative reviews and then bought it anyway. Turns out they are all full of s***. This is an awesome creeper seat. It is well made and very well thought out.",2833,642,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M2QMHK6

Just bought a another for my home office.","I do not understand why so many negative reviews. Yes, Neat offers a cloud scanning service, WHICH IS NOT REQUIRED to use this scanner! We have been using it for quite a while as a stand alone scanner, connected via WiFi, with just a Gmail account. Also have a regular private IMAP e-mail account set up, as well. Both scan and send by default to the e-mail WE PROGRAMMED with literally one button on the screen (which doesn't take a rocket scientist to do). Scans in great quality, BOTH SIDES in a single pass, and immediately e-mails to the preset address. You can also add or replace the destination address easily when preparing to scan.The instructions on the Neat website are clear, though not the easiest to find (I found them by using a search engine looking for ""configure neatconnect scan email"") since, sure, they put their cloud service first to try to convince you to use and pay for that service. BUT, you DO NOT NEED TO PAY FOR ANY SERVICE! Sometimes I think a lot of these negative reviews are competitor products, or just idiots that don't know how to use the scanner they bought. Actually, I think it might just be a lot of idiots that should get rid of their computers and go back to pen and paper. In the past I've supported Fujitsu Snap and other scanners in enterprise environments, and the NeatConnect is much less expensive, every bit as good of quality for the average office or home office, and so much simpler to configure and use on an ongoing basis.",Works great just as advertised.,There were a lot of negative reviews about the previous versions of the Neat scanner. I looked at one a couple years ago and decided not to buy it. I am very glad I waited. The new one is a very good product. I have used it for a few weeks and it was worked perfectly. Still learning about the machine and I am sure there are features that I have not found yet but I am very happy with the purchase. Its a little pricy but if you deal with a lot of paperwork I would recommend you get this product. If all you are doing is day to day bills for personal taxes its probably not for you. I deal with 4000 to maybe 8000 documents a year in my business and it is a great organizational tool. If your personal taxes can fit in a small binder you probably don't need it but even with that I am sure it would help if your willing to spend the money. Before you start you do need to give a lot of thought to how you want to organize your documents. Its not hard just think to save time in the future. I made that mistake and had to scan some of my docs. That is very important but it is very versatile. I was concerned about the speed it would feed the pages through the scanner and paper jams. Thinking about how the old fax machines would feed multiply pages at then same time and not feed each page separately. It has not done that once. It is very quick. 16 pages feeds through in seconds and they are very clear. I only use the black and white. I am sure color would slow it down. I use it for my business and color is not necessary but it in an option. It easily switches from one to two sided copies and still is very quick. To summarize it works and it a very handy tool. As you can see I bought the higher end model and that is what I would recommend. Hope this helps someone. Post any questions and I would be to glad to answer if I can.,Bought Mine as a Spare for When I Wear Out My Current NeatConnect,"I bought this as a spare since Neat is no longer manufacturing their own scanner hardware and I love my neat connect so much I want to have a back-up when I wear out my current NeatConnect. I anticipate another 2-3 years with my current one -- they are well built and I REALLY like the cloud integration -- I don't even hook my NeatConnect to my home computer, I scan them in straight to the cloud and then download the receipts and docs back down to my home computer -- creates an instantaneous backup of everything!",Awesome Scanner,"Timely delivery.

They enjoy stalking their wand toys within the crinkles and crevasses of the crumpled up paper, as well as lurking underneath it and then suddenly popping out when the other cat goes by. I went with this particular brand because another reviewer said she bought it for the same purpose and that it had plenty of body, good rustling sound and held up well despite the daily assaults of dive-bombing kitties. Not sure this is what the seller/manufacturer had in mind for their product, but it meets our needs perfectly.",I like it for wrapping presents.,"I have used construction type brown paper from Lowes-it is to heavy for wrapping. I also have tried the cheap brown from a Dollar Store-it is to light weight, tears easily, and not a good value for the small quantity you get. I recently bought this paper and am quite satisfied with the weight, durability, ease of wrapping and price. I'd recommend it.",Our cats love it!,Haven‚Äôt shipped or packed anything with it since we bought it for our cats to play with.It‚Äôs grade A paper though. Our cats are having a blast with it.,Recyled. good quantity. Multi use. very clean. economical,"I bought this to use as gift wrap for the first place as they advertised. However It‚Äôs a great value, we are using it for kids crafts, and it turns out that this roll can be used for multi-purpose as well.I like it because it is made of recycled paper and but very clean. It is a perfect size to stow away in the closet. My wife find new uses for this paper every time. Well worth the money. Good quantity and sturdy paper.","We went green... Umm, brown lol.",we bought this as an eco-friendly wrapping paper for this holiday season and it seems to have worked out really well. the paper is thick enough that it does not rip or tear easily and there is enough of it on the roll to wrap presents for three kids and then some with enough left over for crafting time.,2261,223,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079VQWKNT

I have a Samsung Chromebook Plus (V2) and it fits in perfectly, with just a little bit of space to spare. The handles are the main reason I chose this case, they fold down and out of the way when not in use, then velcro together over the opening, VERY handy when you are carrying more than just your Chromebook around! I have no idea what the inside is lined with, but it's very soft and I have no worries about it scratching my CB. The outside pocket is a bit stretchy and I am able to carry a huge 26,800 mah charging brick, plus some cables, accessories, etc. Zippers and seams seem to be well-sewn with a heavy thread. The zippers also slide easily, the front pocket zipper is pretty invisible. Anyway, for the price, it's impressive, and I'm pleased with the purchase.","Exactly what I needed, very functional","This was exactly what I needed for the small portable notebook that I purchased. It is lightweight but well padded. It has not only a zipper closure, but the handles also Velcro together for added security. There is a very functional pocket that zippers closed on the front of the bag which I am using to hold both the small mouse that I purchased as well as some papers. The zippers all work well and it is easy to carry. I wanted something functional but not fancy that would protect my Chromebook while making it portable and this has definitely done exactly what I wanted it to.","Very nice case, nice fit for 11.6"" Samsung Chromebook 3","I bought the case for a new Samsung Chromebook that I bought for a trip. I need a slim case that would fit in a small carry on shoulder bag for flying. The case fits nicely and is also works well for storing the Chromebook at home. It was important that the handles folded down to fit in the shoulder bag. Having the velcro helps make a handle with enough substance for carrying around home.I was a little concerned with the reviews that mentioned the horrible smell as I have pretty pronounced chemical allergies. I envisioned the case spending a few days in the garage before using it. There was a mild odor but I was able to use the case right away. Perhaps the product had been ""pre-aired"" since the previous complaints or I just got lucky with the one I received.I was also a bit concerned with reviews mentioning the lack of padding in the edges where the most padding is needed. I looked at a similar Targus Slipskin case in a larger size in the store. I found the edge padding about the same on both. I think I may use a larger used laptop case, if needed, with this case inside for general use. But to date with careful handling around home I have been very happy with this case alone.I cannot speak to either the durability or the water resistance as I have not owned the case long enough nor exposed it to water.Overall I am very happy with the purchase.",Perfect in more ways than One,I bought this for my daughter for her chromebook for school along with a separate case to help unsure if she dropped it it would be safe. As it turns out the case I purchased to keep it safe did not even fit so she used this daily. And as it also turns out she has dropped her chromebook while it was in your case and your case provided enough of a buffer for the chromebook not to break. She loves the handle to carry it around. This was an amazing purchase and I would suggest everyone with students or just for yourself get one of these. Thank you very much!!!!!,"Good protection for Samsung Chromebook 3, will go over a case","I wanted a neoprene-type soft sleeve case that would go over an Alapmk Protective Case Cover For 11.6"" Samsung Chromebook 3 XE500C13 for extra protection. This fills the bill. It's a snug fit with the case cover on the Chromebook, but if you put the thicker side down, the neoprene will stretch and zip over Chromebook 3 and case cover. See photo. I like that there are Velcro tabs on the inside of the 2 handles, so you can use the handles to keep Chromebook 3 plus sleeve case inside if you don't want to zip. The zippered compartment on the soft sleeve is best for small, thin items - user guide, e.g., but a micro corded mouse and OEM AC adapter will fit, with a little bulking up of the side of the sleeve. Durability, travel, and waterproofness [hope I don't have to test that!] - we'll have to see over time. I use a piece of rubber perforated drawer liner to keep the Chromebook from sliding around in use.",4047,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DUN2PBQ

The Beast, as the crew named the Golden Gate Yacht Club's trimaran, was a technical wonder. Its gigantic fixed wing sail towered at over 200 feet making it unbeatable. The author takes you through the entire journey from drawings and concepts to the Beast at the finish line. Reading Learning to Fly felt like I was Jimmy Spithill, careening over the water at breakneck speeds.",Richly insightful,"Got my copy yesterday and read it non stop cover-to-cover. As usual, Roger gets to the heart of the matter; this was a campaign of risk management piled on top of some of the most challenging design work ever seen for a yacht - but in the end it was risk management. In some ways it was a revisit of the Big Boat series on steroids because building the fastest boat was only one leg of the stool also supported by legal and survivability considerations. In my own mind, the most insightful disclosure in the entire book was the special blend of experience and engineering represented by Dave Hubbard supporting the new blood with cautious adult supervision ; the next generation ""wingnuts"".",Dragging the America‚Äôs Cup into the 21st century,"Flying was my vocation for 50+ years. Flying is about speed from A to B. Sailboat racing is about speed from A to B. Faster wins.. This book is about the America‚Äôs Cup, one of the world‚Äôs premier yacht races, and it‚Äôs transition from rules bound monohull boats to 21st century multi-hull technology. It covers the outsized personalities, legal wrangling, business acumen, team building, financial wherewithal, and logistical solutions required to compete at this level. I applaud the willingness to ignore tradition, to go out on a limb and affix a wing similar in length and mechanical complexity to that found on a 450 ton Boeing 747 to a light weight trimaran, then figure out how to tame ‚Äúthe beast‚Äù. Traditionalists may not endorse this new metric but the book will inform those who are, as I am, fascinated by the latest technological advances.",No one knows cup racing better than Vaughan,"Once again Vaughan has hit the nail on the head with a comprehensive view of Cup racing...In a manner that everyone can understand. It was fascinating to learn not only how these new machines work, but to then be put on board for hair raising rides.",Breathtaking read!,"If you are a sailor, enjoy racing, enjoy cutting edge design and engineering of fast boats, this book is for you. I couldn't put it down. The design, engineering, building, testing and re-building of USA17, ""the Beast"" is amazing. The work going from the original rig of traditional sails to a wing is over the top. The loads these guys dealt with are breathtaking.One of my favorite quotes from the book:""John Kostecki says ""terrifying"" is the right word.""Let me put it this way, I was more scared on this boat than I was at any time during the Volvo Race. It wasn't just a little scary, it WAS scary.""Like I said, it's a page turner!",19,7,https://www.amazon.com/dp/1733313524

I was searching a long time for one in both stores and online. The ones I found at the Apple store and BestBuy did not fit my requirements. If they were slim, they didn't have a handle. If they had a handle, they were way too bulky. I had initially ordered the 13-13.3"" sleeve which I found way too big. I should have payed attention to the measurements listed. It had so much space around my laptop so I returned it and ordered the smaller 11"" sleeve. This one fits perfectly. I don't know why the sizes are listed the way they are here but please measure your laptop prior to purchasing the sleeve; look at the inside measurements of the sleeves specifically. I would presume the 13-13.3"" sleeve would actually fit a 15"" MacBook. As far as the bag itself, I just received it so I cannot say anything about durability. It does however look very protective as it has thick padding on either side with a very soft material inside; the padding feels like memory foam. The quality is great too; bags of the same quality sell for at least 3x more in other places. Overall I highly recommend this product if you get the correct size.",Great quality bag.,"I was hesitant to purchase this item due to the lack of reviews but I'm so glad I did. It's made with great material and wonderful quality. I highly recommend this. I fit my MacBook Pro with a hard case in this bag snugly.

An extra inch or so sideways, and extra couple inches in depth. So I don‚Äôt love the fit for my computer specifically, but I‚Äôm not so worried about it. I love how it looks and feels, and really appreciate the handle and that its zipper is only on its side. I used to have a very basic sleeve that fit only the computer very snuggly, but this I know will work better for me to tote a couple extra cables with the laptop and the handle seems nice and sturdy, and will make toting the bag more steady than a plain old sleeve.",ULTIMATE SLIM TRAVEL SLEEVE - Used as my travel Sleeve - not my main sleeve,"When I travel I use this sleeve because I have the new Macbook Pro with touch bar. Like many other laptops, that has a very slim profile. This case allows me to fit my laptop, charger, dongles, iphone charger, headphones, and also an external battery. It is the ultimate slim travel sleeve. Even with all that in it, it is bulky. In addition, I LOVE the handle position on the short side. That make it easy to pull out of my backpack during TSA Security Checks. I am flying about every 2 weeks. I use this when I travel, and a different one as my main. My main sleeve is a felt one from Setton Brothers if anyone is interested",Just what I need!!!,"I ordered this for my 15.6 Asus Vivobook to protect it for when I put it in my bag to travel, and its fits better than expected, I thought it was going to be just enough, BUT it has a little extra space. I love the compartments to hold any chargers or other supplies you might need. The inside is soft, padded, and roomy, I could put some papers or my tablet inside if I need.

This means you‚Äôll enjoy higher quality products and greater ease of use, at a price comparable to the previous model. The SG500 is backwards-compatible with SG400 accessories, so if you already own a bypass tray for the SG400, you will be able to continue using it. This allows you to print on media up to 51Àù long (1295 mm). Like all Sawgrass printers, the SG500 performs its own automatic maintenance cycle for trouble-free printing. For complete peace of mind, the SG500 is now backed by a 2-year warranty, as well as unlimited tech support for the life of the product.","{'ASIN': 'B08C2FW6M1', 'Customer Reviews': '', 'Best Sellers Rank': '', 'Date First Available': '2020-06-29', 'Manufacturer': 'Sawgrass'}",",,Sawgrass Virtuoso SG500 sublimation printer.

As a whole I cant catch that smell and individually I can't smell anything, matter of fact leave an opening so you can smell your products through the plastic because once sealed you can smell ANYTHING.I dont know if there was a different lot in the past that was mess up, my experience is A+, value for your bucks.",Great product!,"I decided to write this review since there were several people complaining about the yellow hue to the shining wrap bags.

And I have a nice smooth surface on which to put printed labels (not pictured bc I haven't done that part yet.I was worried I'd need a heat gun but my hair dried works perfectly on the hottest setting. I followed one reviewers advice and snipped a TINY piece at each corner to allow the corners to seal tightly. And I really like the face that theres an opening so people can smell the soap.

It feels very sturdy, has not fallen out of alignment or settings, and is very comfortable. I do wish it had more of an S or wave shape to support my legs more, but for the cost, this was all right.

My butt bones needed more padding to sit on. Since this cushion seemed to be thickly padded, I gave it a try. It is a firm, but not hard, memory foam, and is nice to sit on. My sits bones now have some padding and I can sit longer. The tailbone notch is also a good thought, and keeps my tailbone from being compressed against the chair. The contoured thigh curves in front are also a good thought, to help your thighs extend off the cushion without going over a hard edge. This does create a round bump in between the thigh curves that prevent you from comfortably sitting with your legs together, not a big deal unless you're wearing a miniskirt... The cover is removable for cleaning, and there is a convenient carry handle on it. I have tried many cushions with memory foam that have been too hard to sit on, but this cushion's foam is both comfortable and supportive. It's not too soft that smooshes down, but firm enough to give you padding and support without being hard to sit on. I recommend!",Comfortable,"I have been working from home mostly these days, and my back is gettingtired as I don't have a proper ergonomic chair. This seat cushion is trulya life saver! It has just the right firmness that is very comfortable touse and yet giving me the support I need! After using the cushion for a fewdays, I can really feel a great relief for my back! I also love the factthat it has a removable cover so it's possible to keep clean by simplythrowing the cover into my washing machine. The non-slip rubber under thecushion is another great feature for keeping the cushion in place while inuse. I'm very happy with this product!",nice and soft,This cushion is nice and soft. I've had another brand that was like sitting on a rock. This one has a nice give to it. I weigh 235# and is ok for my weight but if you weigh more you might try something firmer. This help me with sitting after recent spinal surgery. It could be a tad wider so if your kinda big back there you might not be as happy with it as me. Overall I recommend this for most people out there.,"Well thought out design, quality foam","This seat cushion has quality memory foam in it that seems like it will hold its shape for a long time to come (time will tell). I like a few qualities: the space between your legs curves in so if you want to hold a cup or something between your legs, this cushion won't get in the way. The little raised curve that goes between your bum cheeks keeps you sitting straight forward. The underside has little raised silicone balls to grip the surface so it doesn't slide around and they work very well. There is a handle on the side that makes it easy to carry around with other things still in your hands. The cover is VERY soft and removable for washing, although I would do it on cold since the grippy balls may melt if you do hot water and you have to air dry it. What I don't like (minor)...The logo is pretty prominent, which detracts from the look. I don't think it helps you with better posture, as that is something that normally starts in the mid to upper back, not your butt. Overall, If you need a soft seat for sitting long stints at a time (car rides, office chair, etc) this is a great option and it is worth 5 stars for what it is.","Well Designed, Decently Crafted","A good chair cushion became more and more necessary as I work from home these days due to the pandemic. I can certainly echo the positive reviews of other buyers. This cushion has the right firmness that is comfortable, and it provides sufficient support. It is well built with decent quality. I would expect it to last long. It is well designed. The cover is removable and washable. I would recommend this to others.In the pictures are two different types I own. The bottom one is this product. They are of similar prices. Actually, this one has lower price lately. They are both good but this one is better.Picture 1. The front side surface is smoother and made of better material.Picture 2. The back side is black and has bigger rubber dots. The cushion won‚Äôt move around easily.Therefore I recommend the bottom one which is this product.",6992,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F1XLGB1

No, it does NOT come with a USB or any other printer cable. Yes, you can connect it with a usb cable separately purchased, like any other ink jet, and yes, it is wireless. And, yes, it is definitely a pain in the butt to get connected to wifi initially. I am a fairly competent hardware tech, and I came fairly close to packing it all up and sending it back, except for the nagging feeling that I was that close to getting connected. BIG HINT - use the setup wizard and follow each set of instructions like you have no mind of your own and keep going even when it doesn't work at first. The wizard has multiple ways to make that connection happen, and eventually, it does. Works wonderfully after that. Hey! It's a $40 printer, show a little patience! :)",BEST VALUE,"This review isn't about the one that I just bought it is about the one it replaced (Same exact product though). I had it for about 3 years before the power button quit working. I use it at work for scanning and making some copies and I worked it hard, over the course of time I've put 1000's of scans through it and it trudged on and never let me down. So when it came time to replace it I didn't even look at other options, this is the only one I wanted. At this price point it has to be the best value out there for what it does. Highly recommended.",Good Printer,"I bought this printer to replace the 3520 I had. Had that one for over 5years before a sensor went bad. Would have cost more to ship and fix it then to buy a new one. So I went with the 3620. Wanted the same kind so I wouldn't have to buy new ink cartridges for another model. Bought 3 color and 2 black a few months before the senor went in the other one. Was really happy with the 3520, so it wasn't much of a decision to go with the 3620. I print about 25 to 30 documents with pictures, a week, which is not that much really. The only thing I didn't like about the printer, is that it doesn't come with a power cord which is another reason I went with the 3620. The power cord from the 3520 works with it. It does have WIFI, but I am not crazy about using that so I don't know how that will work. I print everything from my home computer, but I use a USB power cord. Never had a problem with it except in the cases when the power was lost. That is my review of this printer. I would recommend it and would buy it again. Just hope I get the same reliable use out of this one as I did out of the 3520. The only other thing I will mention is, if you print a lot of photos, I don't think this is the right printer. Not that it doesn't print great photos, because it does. It is just that with a lot of color printing, the color ink runs out pretty fast. I print a lot of documents that has color words in it, and the color ink still runs out before the black does. I usually replace the color ink twice before I have to replace the black. But then again, I don't do that much printing. So you have to use your own judgement about what you print and how much. I can just tell you that I am please with it and it does what I want it to do. I can also mention that I have had it about 2 months now with no problems.",I am very happy with this printer,"I bought the Canon MG3620 printer because it's inexpensive and has the features I need. Consumer Reports calls this model a Best Buy, with a rating of ""excellent"" for both convenience and scan quality and an overall rating of ""very good.""In my home office I have the printer connected by a USB cable to my desktop computer, so I've avoided problems with Wi-Fi described by some reviewers. The printer is compact enough to fit in the space available on the desk. The white color is attractive. So far, everything is working just as it should - no problems at all. I am very happy with this printer.Many reviewers on Amazon give the printer only one star. This worried me until I realized that there are similar one-star reviews for comparable printers of all other makes, not just Canon. Just look and you'll see. On the New York Times thewirecutter.com website, the page about all-in-one printers states ""All printers are disappointing, particularly color all-in-ones . . . No printer is free of rough edges, whether they come in the form of paper jams, software glitches, clogged printheads, or flaky Wi-Fi.""One of the complaints I've seen is that paper sheets slide off the top tray after going through the printer. I don't think this is a problem if the directions are followed: pull out the extension on the top tray; on the bottom tray that holds the unprinted paper, swivel out the extension and lift up the flap at the end of this extension.As for complaints about the high cost of ink cartridges, this is how Canon (as well as other manufacturers) makes up for the low cost of the printer. I have no problem with this. If, in time, my printer fails I'll just replace it with another - at $44 it's a steal!",14226,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010A7TZ76

Right now, I have a single stem with leaves, that I'm growing roots from. To clean, you'll need a pipe cleaner brush, or just vigorously shake some dish soap w/water. I don't bother unscrewing the bulb from the holder. (Although, it originally comes unscrewed and you have to screw it in for assembly.)

The old pair that I had got worn out, so I set out to search for a better pair with a good sole (the older pair was a bit slippery, and I almost went flying quite a few times). After searching and searching, I found these.My criteria:- A solid rubber/non-slip sole- A back lip, so my feet don't slide out easily- Soft cushioning to stay comfortable in all day- All black (this is just a preference, because I prefer a neutral color to slip into with any outfit). I only include this because I found that adding this to my search criteria limited the results significantly.How these slippers turned out:- The sole is thick, solid, and a bit heavy. I actually appreciate the weight on the shoe, because they won't flop around like many other slippers do.- The back lip is just thick enough to hug your feet, but not too thick that it feels uncomfortable.- The cushioning. OH THE CUSHIONING. I slipped my feet into these puppies and I felt like they were hugging my feet like they loved me and wanted the best for me. I have slightly wide feet (skinny overall, but wide from side to side), and these slippers wrapped around my feet just right, without making them feel suffocated or stuffy.A couple of other things to keep in mind:- These slippers are THICK. If your feet get hot easily, these might not be the ones for you.- As many of the other reviews state, these do run a bit small. I wear 8.5 in just about every shoe, but these (I bought the L size) feel like they're just about 2 millimeters too short. I do think that they might fit perfectly over time, though, because the cushioning will form to my feet a bit, and it'll be less puffy than it is, now. Still, given the fact that the large size is for sizes 8.5-9, I'd say that they still do run a little small. I say order one full size up, just to be safe.Overall, even with the size issue (the reason for the one missing star), I do love how they feel and they're exactly what I was looking for!** EDIT, MONTHS LATER:I am now updating this review, and adding the 5th star. As I had suspected, wearing them around for a bit has molded the cushioning to my feet wonderfully, and the ""slightly small"" feeling is gone, as the lip on the back of the slipper now cups my heel perfectly. I've worn these shoes almost every day, Monday through Friday, 9am to 5pm, for several months now and I am SO glad that I found them.If my review has helped you in any way, please let me know, or hit ""Yes"" under this review. Thank you! :)",LOVE These Slippers! Comfortable & Well Made,"Bought these along with another more expensive pair of slippers a few months ago. Chose to wear these 1st and I LOVED THEM! Extremely comfortable, great amount of padding, great fit and very durable sole. I wore these indoors and out for months doing lots of walking and if my outdoor walking hadn't destroyed the soles, they'd still be in perfect condition! They're very well made and the soles (meant for indoors) stood up to 9K steps a day outdoors for months - pretty impressive in my book! The only unfortunate part of the story is that when I finally wore these out and went to the other pair I'd ordered, I was extremely disappointed with them in comparison with these Isotoners. The other brand fell apart after only a few days of strictly indoor wear and couldn't come close to comparing to these in regards to comfort, fit, form or function! And since these Isotoners were so great and lasted so long, the return window for the others was already closed :( Oh well, these Isotoners were worth it! Definitely recommend these slippers!",Slip into Slippers,"Super comfortable and warm. I am always searching for comfortable, but supportive slippers. I wear orthotics in my regular shoes, and look for a slipper that has a bit of a heel and arch support. These are the best ones I‚Äôve had in years! They are not heavy, but still secure my foot. Sometimes slippers are too warm, but these keep my feet warm without getting too hot. I don‚Äôt wear them in the summer, and when a started wearing them again recently I found that I was just as pleased with them as when I bought them last year.",A word on sizing‚Ä¶,"I gave the slippers five stars because they are exactly what I wanted. I love the color, I love the fit and the indoor outdoor sole. In my bare feet they are a perfect fit and very comfortable. However, I am returning these (no fault of the product), because I will wear these during cold weather with warm socks, meaning they are too small for what I want. But I gave the product five stars because it is exactly what I ordered, and if I wasn‚Äôt going to wear them with socks they would be 100% perfect. Just going to get a bigger size‚Ä¶",They're comfy!,After trying 2 other brands! I really like these! Who knew it would take so many tries to find house slippers that are actually comfortable.The only annoying thing is the back lip of the slipper that comes up behind the back of my heel... I often step on this part and have to keep pushing it out with my fingers. I think this part could have been eliminated for a better design or made stronger so that it sits upright and doesn't get flattened out by my heel.,19977,2,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015AGPD00

It's made of Plastic.They use High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and Steel.Other foldable tables use Resin (which can have a grindy/grating/dry feel) or a wood veneer (which often lead to sharp edges).For a commercial banquet table (or a rarely used party table) this doesn't matter so much, but for a table you plan to spend hours working on, your forearms will grow to appreciate the smooth curves and soft finish. This is a job WELL done by the manufacturer!2.) The Perfect Size.This is the Goldilocks of table sizes. Not too big, not too small, and not too skinny.I can roll up to this thing on the left or right without hitting my knees on anything structural (I'm 5-10).This is not a Team Table. This is a Lone Wolf Table!Here I may sit with a big mousepad, full keyboard (with numeric pad), squishy wristpad, TWO 24-Inch Monitors, a stack of papers, two big Speakers, my gaming pad (which I macroed for programming), a big cup for hydration, and still have room for snacks.I can even eat full meals at this station without needing to make room.3.) Mobility.You can fold this thing up, throw it in your little car, and go.I bought this as a Makeshift Command Center, so when I visit my business partner in another city, or a client out of town, I have a place to sit and hammer out some serious code in either my buddy's spare room or in the hotel while on the road.Disclaimer: I haven't used this in a hotel room yet. I've had rooms with big tables, some with small tables, table built-in's facing opposite the TV, and others with sadistic round tables, so it'll be nice to know this is laying in the trunk should I feel the need.It's also great having a portable table you can use while your buddy codes along side you in the same room (I've actually done this before with our tables facing a big window at night in Vegas while we worked there all week and it was awesome).I may now lay out my all my portable gear: a 17-inch laptop in ""Tent/Stand Mode"", full keyboard, mouse, programmable macro-pad, and USB monitor (as a 2nd monitor). In case you were wondering, this laptop does exist, it's the Dell Inspiron 17 7000.Suggestions:1.) Color Options.I would buy this again in a dark brown - anything dark, so it doesn't stand out like someone still has yet to break down the party from the night before. It's a bit of an eyesore with my black gear and wires running all over it in a dark living room.2.) Move the Handle.You cannot rest this thing anywhere while holding the handle because the two sharp circular thin hinges protruding out of the bottom will rip up your hardwood floor. You must always be aware of this and remember to set on its side instead.3.) Make it Easier to Open:I shouldn't have to summon the strength of 10 feral orangutans to open this thing.Cons:My first review of this table was harsh.I complained about the table: 1.) having sharp hinges sticking out, 2.) the placement of the handle so the sharp hinges scrape up the floor, 3.) difficulty opening, 4.) mine arriving damaged and cracked (I'd blame UPS for this, but just look at all the other photos people have posted - this is a serious issue with this table, so I'm thinking they need to do a better job protecting my purchase when packaging).Difficulty Opening:When I say ""difficulty opening"", I mean you need some serious he-man strength with construction worker hands to open this thing by yourself.It was embarrassing trying to open it in front of others before I had to give up and ask for help.What can I say? I have delicate little coder-hands that have never seen a day of hard work.It could be mine needs a few more open-close cycles before ""loosening up"", or maybe mine was manufactured with a tighter fit than most, or maybe (which is most likely) I'm a whiny little wimp!It's all about Leverage:Now, when I sat this down (hinges first) on my carpet, I was able to open it up with only my hands, like a man.When I try opening it on it's side (like you'd do when trying to avoid scratching up your hardwood floor), I couldn't do it.I concluded the force I was exerting by bending over to open it with hinges against the carpet, gave me the leverage needed to pry it open because I was pushing down on it hard with my elbows pointing towards the floor at 45 degrees.You don't have this leverage when opening from the side.Solution: Walk it over to a carpeted area or grassy patch and crack it open before setting it up on a delicate surface - problem solved!Compared to Other Tables:I decided to look for another table. That's when I noticed how mine is made of soft/smooth plastic, and others weren't.Then I noticed that those with the hinges that did not protrude while folded, had theirs protrude below while the table when open, so you might feel it with your leg or rub your hand along it while sitting.The arm of my chair or FitBit would definitely scrape up against it, if it were there - which I'm glad it's not.This is when I realized they designed it this way for a reason - to prevent the hinges from being visible or touchable when open.The reason why it closes so tightly is to keep it from opening up when you pull it by the handle.All of the tables I looked at (that were sturdy and could hold 300lbs) weighed about 20lbs or more - so this tracks.Then I noticed this foldable table size (which is really a ""Desk Size"") was rare compared to the square and 6ft tables.Summary:After this realization (and after using this table for weeks with no issues since opening it), I rewrote this entire review and changed my rating.At home I'm trying it out in the living room to work on while glancing at the TV and being in the middle of the goings on, but I doubt I'll be allowed to do that for much longer - as it is an eyesore to those around me.I recommend this table for the type of work I do.Thank you Best Choice Products for making this my... best choice.",Strong and well designed,"Table has well designed hinges at the center. Also has two auxiliary steel pins that slide between the center steel joins.I have 310lbs on the table in the picture. All the weight is supported by the hinges and center steel square tubes. The pins are not even loaded with this weight and can slide easily. I'd be comfortable putting a 600lb glass vase on this table....you'd have to be very talented to break this table with a 60lb vase.The underside of the table stores the leg extensions, axillary support pins, and folding legs.","A life saver for gatherings, and easy to put up and down.","Why, oh why, did I wait so long to buy this? We entertain frequently and to us, that means feeding everyone to within an inch of their lives. So, we wind up with every table and countertop loaded with food. I finally decided it would be worth shuffling a bit of furniture to put up a big table, and started shopping. I had no idea they made them that folded. I was picturing it having a huge crack down the middle that would be noticeable. I was pleasantly surprised. There's hardly a seam at all. When you throw a tablecloth over top of it, you have no idea that it even has a seam. It's sturdy as can be, and stood up to the heat of a half-dozen crock pots. So, it's a keeper.When it's folded, it has a little handle, and I can lug it one handed. Folds up and down quite easily. I did it on my own, and I'm only 5'4"", so I don't have long arms. Caps on the bottom of the table legs keep it from scratching up your floors, too.We store ours in a closet, up against the wall behind the clothing.",Very sturdy table,"I ordered this table to hold a group of plants that I had to bring home from my workplace due to COVID closing. I needed enough space to spread out the plants, and something that wouldn't collapse under their combined weight. They were on the floor at first, because I thought it would just be a week or so... Well, four weeks later, I got tired of bending over and tired of the mess on the floor. I found this table and I like that it folded in half, because when this is all over, I won't need it, except for maybe using it at family picnics. (Doesn't that sound like a nice idea?) but I digress... This is a really STRONG table. It is a bit heavy, and that made it a little difficult to set it up with just one person. It kept wanting to fold in on itself whenever I was trying to flip it right-side up on my own. However, that should be NO problem if you set it up with 2 people. But if you are on your own, be aware it might take a minute more and more muscle than you think.",A Pleasant Surprise,"After seeing all the comments about this table arriving damaged, I suppose I'm just lucky but neither the table nor the very heavy cardboard shipping box was damaged. The table perimeter in the shipping box IS surrounded by firm foam to protect it. I wouldn't have thought the surfaces could be cracked, but apparently they can.This table was just what I needed. It's substantial, weighs around 20 lb. The carrying handle is comfortable and doesn't cut into my hands. If necessary, the handle can just fold back inside the folded halves so it doesn't get broken off. It's easy to set up and substantial enough for what it is. I saw a comment by someone else saying that the manufacturer claimed 1500 lb. could be stacked on it. Of course not. I bought it to use at times alongside my charcoal grill and this will be perfect. Easy-to-clean surface and will store with very little required space.",7024,786,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D491T2W

A couple of other reviewers have mentioned this issue, but I didn't see their reviews before I made my purchase.The locking mechanism that secures the ladder in its ""deployed"" position is a plastic latch that dangles VERY loosely on the underside of the 3rd step (the large plastic step which you stand on). This doesn't appear to affect the safety of the ladder while using it. When the ladder is deployed, the latch does catch the metal cross bar which supports the black plastic step. Because the latch is loose instead of tight, there will be some ""play"" on the 3rd step when you're not standing on it. But there doesn't seem to be a danger of the latch accidentally disengaging, so it appears to do its job.Here's what I like about this ladder:* Extremely lightweight and maneuverable* Despite the loose latch, it does feel secure* Perfect height for reaching smoke alarms and light fixtures on a 9 foot ceiling* Very compact when folded up* Folds and unfolds very easilyI decided to keep the ladder because I don't believe the loose latch will be a safety issue. When standing on the 3rd step, the weight of the user will be applying downward force against the step and the supporting metal crossbar below, so there is no wobbling of the step while standing on it. And despite its looseness, the latch does appear to keep the 3rd step from disengaging from the cross bar unintentionally. You must apply light upward force on the latch for it to disengage.","Lightweight, yet amazingly solid and secure feeling step stool","I've had the same step stool in my home for the past 25 years, and it was falling apart. In fact, a couple people fell off of it recently, so it really needed replacing. I am so glad I found this step stool It is sturdy and has that extra third step that makes it so much easier to reach the high shelves in my kitchen and change light bulbs and smoke detector batteries.This step stool is well made and extremely sturdy. I am not a lightweight and it holds me easily and the top step is wide and gives me room to stand comfortably. There's also the little shelf at the top where I can put small items that I need when I'm up high, like the bulbs I'm changing or small tools and hardware. I am mid 50s and don't like climbing on ladders anymore, but I feel pretty secure on this step stool.Another great thing about this step stool is that it closes with one hand (there's a little handle under the wide step) and folds flat, taking up very little space in my closet. This one is a winner, and I'm really glad I found it. Step stools have certainly come a long way in the past 25 years.",2 step ladder is perfect for apartment use,"+Folds perfectly flat. Top bar stabilizes your legs while standing on large top step.- tool tray cutouts arent as helpful as anticipated, I thought there was a cupholder but its too small.Helpful Measurements FYI : (Open) tray is 37 inches high, top step is 19 inches, and lowest step is 9 inches.Standing on the top step an average height male will be almost to a standard ceiling height. Perfect! the 3 step will be too tall for indoor use.",Love Rubbermaid 2 step/3 step steel/aluminum ladders,"I bought a 3 step steel Rubbermaid latter (with project tray) many years ago and I still love it. When our old 2 step ladder needed to be replaced the decision to get a replacement made by Rubbermaid was easy. Now they also make their ladders in lightweight aluminum. 6 months ago I bought my mother the Rubbermaid aluminum 3 step ladder (RMA-3T) and man is it light compared to my steel ladder. She is retired and will have no problem lifting it. I like the large top step on this ladder (just like my 3 step steel ladder has) and there is a magnet in the center of the little tray, an unexpected nice touch. The red hook on the tray locks positively into place and will not pop open easily. The ladder is lightweight, sturdy, locks open nicely and closes easily. This ladder is so light I can carry it with 1 or 2 fingers. If you want/need the light weight, the extra money for the aluminum over the steel is worth it.","GREAT STEP LADDER, ULTRA LIGHT WEIGHT, PLENTY STRONG TO HOLD MY 180 POUND BODY","I live on a farm in Florida and need to constantly be doing things outside which require a little bit more elevation to reach something.I have a steel 3-step ladder I bought at a local hardware store, it is heavy and a bit unstable due to the way the rear foot is constructed. The heavy weight makes it a drag to carry it around to do small jobs. The instability is also a problem.Finally I went looking for a replacement because I have a bunch of tasks to do this winter on our 5-acre farm. This ladder arrived and I wondered if it was actually in the box, the carton was so light weight. I opened it up and found this step ladder inside.This is a seriously great step ladder.

Or you could use it to charge a USB device - such as a laptop - from inside the bag, by connecting a charger to the outside port.

My favorite thing is that it still looks nice enough to take to a meeting or travel or just to the hospital for work. And I don‚Äôt mind throwing it around when my laptop is in it because that laptop pocket is no joke! It‚Äôs stays true to form and is a nice snug feeling with almost a quilted lining.

It fits my laptop and any other personal items I want to take with me. I love how padded and ergonomic the straps are and how it has a charging cable and so many protective pockets. I really feel like I can travel safe and secure with my electronics with this backpack. I recommend it for anyone wishing to do the same!

Perfect amount of storage space with a wide range of available pockets.I was really impressed with the laptop compartment. My 14"" laptop fits with a bunch of room to spare. Plus, this is easily the most protective laptop compartment I have seen on a backpack. It is not just a pocket with a strap for the laptop, it is actually protective.If I could change anything, I would take away the zip feature for the side water bottle pocket. It is unnecessary and restricts the size of the water bottle that can fit in there (my 36oz Yeti fits in my Under Armor bag's pocket, but no chance it fits in this one).Overall, it really is a perfect bag for work or school.

Before you purchase one, it's important to understand how and why. It took me quite a while reading their site and reviews, and even then it took owning one for me to really understand. This will hopefully save you some time.Let me start by saying I purchased this machine on my own with no discounts or incentives. Bunn... you owe me!I purchased my first Bunn several months ago after considerable investigation and I am thrilled with it. For the past 10 years I've had multiple Mr. Coffee's and a Nespreso machine, and have drank coffee from various other machine's at friends homes. I thought all at-home coffee tasted bad and burnt and blamed the coffee bean companies. Only now do I understand it was the machine designs ruining things.To understand Bunn you must first realize the functional design of every other coffeemaker on the market is wrong. Those coffee machines wait dormant for you to indicate that you want a cup of coffee, and then go about boiling the water and channeling boiling water over the ground coffee. The result of this process is that you wait around endlessly... literally waiting for water to boil... for 5 to 10 minutes and then drink the result of boiled water poured over coffee grounds (bitterness).The Bunn approach is thata) you shouldn't have to wait for water to boil; andb) boiled water (212F) is the wrong temperature for making good coffee.Bunn's carafe (at least for my model) holds roughly 10 cups of water, but the water tank in the machine holds 20. And THAT is the genius of their design. Why does the machine hold twice as much water as the carafe can handle? The Bunn coffeemaker has a stainless steel water heater tank inside of it that ALWAYS has exactly 10 cups of water at the perfect temperature for making coffee. When you Fill the carafe and pour it into the machine, the machine uses the new cold water to displace the existing hot water. The result is that the existing hot water immediately starts pouring over the grinds. Within around 5 seconds coffee starts pouring at a steady flow into the carafe, and those first 5 seconds are the time it takes to soak through the coffee grinds/filter. It's immediate. The flow is also somewhat heavier/faster, and within 2 minutes (faster if you're not filling the whole pot) you're completely done. The speed of this machine will blow you away.Further, the temperature the machine holds the water at is around 195F... the correct temperature for making good coffee. Why does the coffee out of your existing machine always taste burnt? The design of those machines relies on the water boiling... that's how the water moves through the system. Boiling water is 212F, and at that temperature the water scalds the beans resulting in a bitter taste. No it's not the beans or even the plastic... it's the water temperature ruining your morning brew.Immediately all those bitter store coffees tasted amazing. Smooth... delicious... with flavors I had never noticed before. I suddenly had to go back and re-purchase every coffee brand/type I'd ever written off so I could re-evaluate them. It's literally changed my entire view on coffee. Now, not every coffee you buy at the store is going to be amazing... luxury beans will still be better, but by and large this machine significantly moved the needle on every one. Previously I'd rate every coffee I'd ever made at home from a C to an F. Now it's A to C, with even the worst cup of store-brand being nearly as good as the top luxury beans with previous coffeemakers.Between the speed of brew and the amazing results, this machine is AWESOME.There are some more notes with design points you should understand:- There is no ""On"" button for starting the coffee making process. Remember the water is already hot and waiting, and the process uses displacement, so nothing electronic needs to happen to make a pot of coffee. There are two on/off toggles (they glow blue when on) that do other things as follows: a) In the way back of the machine there is an on/off toggle that controls the water heater on/off. This should always be set to on, unless you're going on vacation (and even then you could just unplug it). That's likely why they stuck this toggle so far back. You won't even see it unless you're looking for it. b) On the front of the machine there is an on/off toggle which everybody will think starts the coffee making. It does not. This on/off toggle simply controls the hot plate below the carafe. You can turn it on if you want, or not... it doesn't matter unless you're trying to keep the coffee already-made hot for a long time.- The coffee making process starts by closing the lid to where you pour in the new water. I haven't opened up the machine to see exactly how it works, but it appears the lid pushes down on a small lever which opens up the inner mechanism allowing the new cold water to push out the existing hot water. This is the hardest part of getting use to this machine. First off you'll want to be pressing some button to start the process... it will feel awkward not to. Seconds... you have to remember not to close the lid until the carafe is in place or coffee will start pouring out.- However much water you pour in, the machine will put out the exact same amount, to the drop. The machine always has precisely 10 cups of water in it... if you pour in 3 more cups, it will dispense exactly 3 cups of hot water. I've tested this and the accuracy is spot-on.- Remember what I said earlier... the carafe holds 10 cups and there are 10 cups of hot water already waiting for you in the machine, but the internal tank holds up to 20 cups. So you can fill up the carafe completely and pour it all in at once, and the machine will not overflow. Also... the pour-in area of the machine is great. Right up front and easy to access (unlike the Mr. Coffee) and the water just goes straight-in with no splashing, missing or over-pouring.- About 5 mins after your coffee is done being made, the machine will automatically kick in heating up the new water to the necessary temperature. It's not overly loud or annoying but you can hear it if you're in the same room. It's another 5 minutes or so to heat the coffee up.- The pour-over on the grinds is great. The flow is very fast, and yet when you take the grounds basket out there is no ride-up of grinds on the filter. I've never seen a single ground make it through into the coffee pot. Also, I should turn the basket upside down over the garbage and the used filter/grounds come right out clean. I usually pour a spritz of water over the empty basket out of habit... but I probably don't even need to do that. There is never residue.- The manual says to pour a minimum of 4 cups of water into the machine for any batch. The carafe also has a minimum indicator at 4 cups. This worried me as I often just want to make a single cup. I fill up a mug of water everyday, pour it in, and then put the mug where the carafe is supposed to go and the machine works flawlessly filling it with coffee to the exact same level. I don't know why they said there is a 4 cup minimum and maybe I am somehow slowly damaging the machine by not obeying them, but it works just fine to do it.If I had a complaint about this machine it would be the hot plate. The hot plate gets too hot (just like every other machine on the market). The result of leaving it on too long is... you guessed it... thick dark bitter coffee. I recommend using the hot plate only for short period of 20-30 minutes max. Also it would be great if the hot plate turned off on it's own after some amount of time.Overall I cannot recommend this machine enough. The coffee is so smooth and delicious you'll never go back.",Fast isn't always good.,"I got my bunn in the mail last night, I was looking forward to it as I've had a Bunn for 20 plus years and have been using a Mr. Coffee for about four months. I am so so disappointed. My whole house smells like burned plastic and my coffee is very weak. My coffee was ready in 2 minutes flat, but maybe there's a reason it takes a few minutes longer with another coffeemaker, more flavor? I had to pour my cup of coffee out and double my coffee grounds to get a good flavor. Sadly, I will send this one back.",Fast Hot Coffee,"Unpacked, wiped down, rinsed, and set up PER INSTRUCTIONS. Tasty hot coffee instantly. As soon as you pour in water, replace coffee carafe on warmer and close the lid, coffee starts flowing. Follow the instructions. Do not plug it in first. Do not turn it on first. Pour in 2 full carafes of water, let overflow water release into carafe, empty excess water, then plug in and turn on. No plastic smell, no burnt tasting coffee. Would be nice if there was just a tad more stainless and not as much plastic but water basin is stainless so that should help with clean taste and durability.",Best brand of coffee makers ever.,"I love the style and design, simple operation and DEPENDABLE.

A no-frills, idiot-proof (if you follow the one-time 10 minute setup process) well-designed coffee maker. No programming required, no timer, no clock, a semi-permanent tank heater switch (turn off when you leave for vacation) and a carafe hot plate switch that stays on until you turn it off, keeping your coffee left in the pot always hot. Ever had a power outage and your coffee maker loses all it‚Äôs programming features, leaving you frustrated with trying to remember what buttons to press to get everything back to your preferences? No more hassling with that anymore, as this is just a genuine nuts and bolt design that serves only one purpose, a super quick pot of flavorful hot coffee at just the right temperature.I drink coffee all day long and have done so for the last 40 plus years. I don‚Äôt care for Starbucks or any of that expensive fancy designer fluff. I prefer the old-timers Diner coffee served hot and black and this one delivers. Though I‚Äôm sure the coffee artists out there can satisfy their own taste buds to their delight. Currently, I use a 32 oz insulated coffee mug that keeps my coffee hot until it‚Äôs emptied. My only complaint is that this Bunn Coffee Carafe (pot) is only 50 oz, but that is easily compensated with the super-quick remake process. Just adding a scoop of coffee grounds (I only change the filter for the first morning cup) and fresh water, you have a full pot of hot coffee in only 3-4 minutes. There is an easy-to-read fill marker just under the fill lid but whatever amount of water is added (after the initial tank setup), that is the exact amount that fills back into the pot. The water reservoir always maintains 50 oz (full pot) of heated standby water at the ready and you can‚Äôt overfill or under fill. The control switch for a fresh pot to dispense is fixed on the lid of the water fill tank where a continuous electrical current keeps a full pot of hot water ready to go at all times. By closing the water fill lid, the process immediately begins. You only need to remember to turn the hot plate switch off when you retire for bed or had your last cup of the day. Though it was left on overnight once, it didn‚Äôt burn what little was left in the pot, it just needed a quick rinse and was ready to go. My lovely wife usually places a new filter with grounds and fills a pot of fresh water in the tank before bed, then flips the fill lid closed first thing in the morning. And while there is no ‚ÄúSneak-a-Cup‚Äù feature, this machine makes a full pot so fast, you don‚Äôt need it! And it has never overcooked or boiled grounds back into the pot. I noticed one reviewer claiming such an experience but I don‚Äôt see how that is possible. This utilizes an angle spray feature that hits the lower sides of the filter always keeping all the grounds soaked and at the bottom.Having tried so many different coffee makers over the years with gimmicky programming features, a hot plate that automatically shuts off after 2-4 hours, I‚Äôve at long last found the perfect solution with this Bunn unit. And the bonus is that this is made in the good ole USA with a factory 3 year warranty. That alone should stand as the critical selling point today. If this one holds up beyond the warranty period and fulfills the only requirement that I ask, it‚Äôs a sold 5-star rating for me! Perhaps a little on the pricey end, but at least my money isn‚Äôt going to an enemy nation who seeks our destruction!",2838,451,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B9BNLHM

I use mine in the house, but only because I don‚Äôt have concrete in the barn yet and it wouldn‚Äôt roll in there.I do A LOT of craft projects, and tend to have a lot of items out at once. That means I have to move around a lot to gain access to them. This stool is perfect for my craft area, because I can just roll over to the other side of the table or whatever.I especially like the shelf on the bottom of the stool, because I can store tools or small items there for use off and on, without them cluttering up the work area. And, it moves easily up and down, so it works great for the different levels that I work on. I‚Äôm currently working on a dollhouse, and I go between working on the first and second floor or roof, while also putting together small parts on the table. Being able to adjust the stool makes it so much easier!Assembly couldn‚Äôt be an easier. Take it out of the box, put the top on the bottom. That‚Äôs it, end of story. No need for special tools or trying to figure out instructions written by someone who can barely speak English.","Need better assembly instructions, but otherwise great.  Perfect for detailing your car.","This stool has been a life saver. I have orthopedic issues, arthritis, spinal problems etc and continuous bending over can be painful. I wanted to keep the bottom of my car clean obviously but there is also black trim around the bottom edges which requires a different treatment. The treatment to keep the black plastic looking good, is really good but after you apply it, you have to buff it, much like you would with waxing a car. After doing it once, I realized that first I did a less than good job and secondly that I would soon skip that part because it just made my shoulder and back hurt too much.This stool once assembled has been absolutely wonderful. I just scoot all around the car. I can even put the spray bottle of product and the cleaning cloths on the bottom tray. It is comfortable when compared to an all metal seat. I mean seriously they are not expecting you to be setting on it for hours and hours! For a half hour or so, it is absolutely great.My only complaint was the assembly. It just sit to put the three pieces together, nothing else, no trouble shooting or further explanation provided. Luckily I was able to pose my issue, which was that the seat didn't attach no matter how often I tried to turn it on the pole which I thought made sense. Answers from other customers came quickly telling me to sit on it and your weight would cause the seat to attach to the pole at which point you can raise and lower it also. As the seat was just balanced on the pole, I had my doubts and had a chair near by should it come off drropping me to the floor. But the guy who answered was correct. I don't know why or how that works to attach the seat to the pole but it definitely did. I may still end up on my behind because I have been zipping a bit too fast around the car, but that is all on my shoulders!I would definitely recommend this to mechanics, detailers and anyone else who has to regularly perform a task located at knee height or so. The range of height has been more than adequate for all my car needs and in terms of functionality it is better than 5 stars! I do note that seats which look identical which are offered by some of the detail companies cost a hundred dollars or more and the only difference as far as I can see is that the company name isn't printed across the seat.UPDATE: This is a blessing. I recently did big time house cleaning and everywhere I had to ""go low"" to clean, I sit and scooted on this rather than continual bending. The screened in porch has brick floor and I thought it might not work as well to clean the lowest glass that starts at floor level, but little issues. I had to put a bit more umph in the push, but worked great.If bending over to clean makes your back hurt like mad, then this is the best $$ you can spend. No more bending, can adjust to the most comfortable level and gives you a chance to clean sitting down so your feet get a break too.",Must have for the garage!,"Great deal on a garage chair. If you're looking for an inexpensive rolly chair for your garage/shop then this is the one. I know this is not the absolute best, but for what you pay this is a great deal. I am 6'3 225lbs and I have no issues with this chair. It is built pretty solid. I use this chair for washing/waxing the wheels and lower parts of my car. It's not the most solid built garage chair I have sat on but it does not feel like it is going to fall apart like some chairs I have used before. I wish I could still find the Goodyear Racing shop seat. On the Goodyear chair the bottom of the actual cusion was a metal disc which kept the seating very solid. This pro-lift chair has a little flex if you sit on the edge of the seat, but not much. I think the bottom of the chair is just like a stiff cardboard or plastic disc, that's just one little detail I don't like but I suppose I could lose some weight to fix that too. I still would buy another one of these chairs if I needed one.",Just what I needed and didn't know I did,"I recently injured my knee and have been having some problems sorting, cleaning and taking things off shelves at lower levels, and walking in general. I saw this when I was just looking for a stepstool and decided to try it. It makes a huge difference. I can move about freely on it, working at low heights, then can hydraulic it up to where standing and getting off is easy. I can carry things easily in the tray as well. It's just handy in the house for all of the things my bum knee has been making difficult for me. I love being able to get off of it at a higher more comfortable height and then lower myself to do the housework I need to do. The seat is reasonably comfortable, and the only thing that requires some real attention to is making sure I am stable and able to hold onto something when I get off of it as it is very mobile and would be easy to knock away while lowering yourself to it. I am in my sixties, 5'4"" and 135 lbs so well within the maximum weight limit.....mentioning that because there are some comments about problems with this from taller bigger folks. I hope it wears as well as it works. Love it...feels like freedom and more efficient housework.",Great Garage Addition,So over the years I've been detailing my car and most of the time I've used nothing to sit on or a small chair that is upstairs in a closet that I bring down and move back being a huge pain. I read the reviews on this stool and it seemed good enough and cheap enough to buy. One thing I was leery about was one review had issues with it tipping. So far I've used this quite a bit and have had no issues with it tipping. I'm an average size guy 6' 200lbs and don't have problems moving around the garage or car while I'm cleaning it. My garage is small and I leave enough space to get around the front bumper and back I have to hang out or go out of the garage door which means going over the lip buy the door entrance. Still no problem. I'm fairly athletic and just hold one or shift my weight with my legs and move it where I need to. I don't need it to be much higher than the lowest setting. I'm sure that you raise it and heighten your center of gravity it will obviously effect that. But for me this is a great product that helps me better clean my cars with out killing my back or knees. I recently bought some ONR Wash and Wax and I've used it to clean or wash my car without a lot of water and this help tremendously. I don't have tools but the tray below is plenty big and would work well to hold anything small you need. There are five wheels which to me is more stable than the other four wheel stools that I've seen. The wheels roll smooth and again I'm in a nice smooth garage but while I'm cleaning the back bumper I'm rolling around on the more course concrete and they roll fine. Overall I'm pretty happy with this purchase I'm sure it's a must in some professions that work on cars or detail cars on a daily basis. As for occasional need for me it's great and I would highly recommend.,6241,858,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009EUA0M

I cut a piece to roll up some 70mm film (on a 116 film spool) and marked the frames with a silver Sharpie. A couple of things...the paper is at 4 mil (0.004‚Äù), just like the Kodak film backing paper, except, there is no coating on this paper, which I only see as a negligible inconvenience because the paper won‚Äôt readily retain that ‚Äúcurl‚Äù, but after leaving it curled up on its own for a few weeks, it keeps some of the curl. The next thing, it looks great, like it will do the job and it held up well on the prototype roll. I shone an LED flashlight directly, point-blank, onto the Kodak paper and it did not bleed through in subdued daylight (indoors), but doing the same with this paper, even though it is the same thickness, the light did bleed through, at that point resembling very very dark parchment paper. By then I had already shot the roll of film and developed it. I haven‚Äôt had the time to make prints, so I can only attest to the negatives at a glance - no apparent fogging. I did notice no LED light bled through with two layers of this paper, so on the upside, while rolled up the film is safe. I did anticipate fogging, so when I would advance the film I turned my back to the sun to protect the number viewing window. In the end, I wish it was coated, and a bit more ‚Äúfilled-in‚Äù so that one layer of paper will not allow light to pass, but for what is readily available these days, this is a viable alternative to proper roll film backing paper.

So after I bought the variety pack I thought I would post this for all to see. I found the 24‚Äù strap was the best length for me so bought this pack of 10 as well. The first image is the chart of all five straps. The first row of lengths is the resting strap length hook to hook as it would be connected. The second row is the strap stretched to the max length I would use it at. The second picture is the 24 inch strap adjusted to be the length of the 18 inch strap. This is to show that, when in doubt, buy the longer strap because it can easily be adjusted shorter. The third picture is a closer up of how the strap adjusts. It basically slides to any length until you pull it 90¬∞ and pinch it between the plastic forks. Hope this helps!",How I ever did without these I don't know,"These are PHENONENAL. I've had lots of bungee cords, had I known about these would've bought them long ago. Top quality, awesome hooks, look great, and best of all the hooks are detachable and the cords adjustable- instructions not needed, a monkey could do it (but see below for how I did it and an alternate, quicker method, with photos). I bought a tarp to partially cover my motorhome and shield it from the hot sun (great if you're looking for one:¬†",These are heavy duty!,"I needed bungee cords to keep my outdoor table cover from blowing away during a New York winter. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that there is such a thing as an adjustable bungee cord. These work amazing! Because they are adjustable, I was able to get a very tight fit around the cover of my table. These are worth every penny. They are well made, and the cords themselves are substantial. The hooks and the part that attached the hook to the cord are plastic, but it seems to be high grade. I wrapped velcro straps around the hooks just in case, as the wind can be quite damaging in the winter and I didn't want to worry, with the ice and snow, that an attachment would snap from the cold and ice. These are way better than the cheap ones you get in the dollar stores, and they are adjustable!",Best Bungee Cords Ever,"These are probably the best bungee cords that I have ever used. I've used my fair share of bungee cords over the years. I usually get the cheapest ones that I can find, and am subsequently disappointed by how fast they wear out. I am a huge fan of these cables because I have had them 6 months so far and they still have an incredible amount of elasticity. Most cables would have been stretched out so that they are only elastic at near max length. Not only do these cables have superior elastic properties, you can adjust each end so that you can have the maximum amount of applied force. They are super stretchy though and blow away the kind that you find at harbor freight. Although they have faded a little since I got them, I am pretty sure that they have most of the same elasticity as when they were new. The ones that have been under tension for 6 months only feel slightly less elastic than one that has been used periodically. I use it to strap down boxes in my work van and I have never had one fail on me, or had the locking mechanism slip.I would also like to point out the amazing value to quality ratio. These are definitely worth the price I paid, and in fact I bought another pack of them recently. The straps are very long, and even if you do not need all the length you can shorten an end. This is way better than buying assorted lengths IMO. They are only about $1.50 a piece so if you need long bungee cords these are the ones you want!",Secure,"Bungee cords, like rope and twine, are an indispensable part of the home supply kit. We use our 24-inch set outdoors to tie down tarps and secure our garbage, recycling and composting bins (see pix). In eight months of outdoor use - through bitter cold, searing heat, rain and snow - the cords have lost most of their color, but have retained their tension. Likewise, the thick, plastic hooks have maintained their gripping power showing no cracks or warping from the elements or constant pressure from almost continuous use. The housing, through which the cord length can be shortened, still allows smooth passage and secure holds. We are pleased with our purchase. The Kotap cords are an outstanding, all-purpose indoor/outdoor product at an attractive price (less than two bucks per cord).",7021,907,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UW5BM9Q

Because ""right angled"" plugs do not have a 90 degree to them at the wall socket, nor do they necessarily angle the cord to the right. Most flat angled plugs come angled to the right, but Woods is one of the few that actually makes them angled to the left. The pictures advertised show that the ""right angled"" plug is actually angled to the left. Well I just so happen to be looking for a 'left angled' plug, so I was hoping the pictures were correct. After a quick search on the web for the same model, all pictures confirmed the 'left angle' so went with it. My search also revealed one other brand that made a 'left angled' plug, but not many places carried the item, and when they did it was expensive.I was actually looking for a 360 degree rotating plug extension cord when I came across this one, and those are 3-4 times the price of these for the same length.There's not much to say about these really, they're 8 ft as they claim to be and they're UL Listed which means that Underwriter Laboratories (UL) has tested representative samples of a product and determined that the product meets specific, defined requirements. These requirements are often based on UL's published and nationally recognized Standards for Safety. Oh, and they're certified for Canada too.The extension cord is your standard 16/3 gauge cord. It's 8 feet in length, it's white and the plug is flat at the socket with the cord angled to the left. I trust Woods will not lie about the specs and I used it to power indoor Christmas decorations. They were perfect for what I need them for, and despite the description of ""right angled"", they're 'left angled' as depicted in the pictures.Fulfilled by Amazon has never let me down. Packaged nicely and shipped quickly.Updated 2020-04-25.Someone had recently asked if this is in wall rated, meaning, can I run this extension inside a wall (to hide cables for flat screen TV's and the like. The short answer is NO.Extension cords are not designed or made for use inside a wall or ceiling, not even heavy-duty types, due to National Electrical Code restrictions. Extension cords sold in retail stores in North America, have labeling specifically warning not for use inside walls or ceilings.No matter what you may be told, or how long you search online, there are absolutely no type of extension cords manufactured anywhere in the world rated for in-wall use for North America.",This is an excellent choice for a good extension cord..,"I am very happy with this extension cord. It is heavy duty and it doesn't block other outlets which is really important since we have so few outlets in our old house. It accommodates three different plugs (2 or 3 prong) and is long at 8 feet. I thought the head looked weird and would be hard to plug in but it's super easy and it stays put. I am going to purchase a few more. I am so glad I didn't run to the dollar store to get a cheap one outlet extension cord. This one is worlds better. Two can fit together on a wall outlet, giving me six outlets without the bulk of a heavy box. Do know that the head is three prong so you must plug it into outlets that accommodate three prong plugs. Most do but I have some that don't. I am n need of an electricity overhaul, I think!",Nicer than your average extension cord.,"Very nice extension cord. The part that goes into the wall is flat and to the side, so you can easily have furniture or whatever in front of it without a plug sticking out from the wall. The portion for other devices is long with 3 plugs side by side rather than the normal front and back extension cord. It almost looks like a very simplistic surge protector. Nice buy.",Extension cord for behind the furniture use,"I've used these before and when they showed up for a discounted deal, I stocked up on a couple more.The plugs are flat and fit easily behind furniture without having to leave space or risk bent/cut wires. Also, the plug is designed to go diagonally on the wall leaving the other socket open for something else.Cable itself is sturdy and well made. The plug-in sockets have sliding locks to disable accidental connections / shocks.These are different from the ones I ordered in past. All 3 sockets in this are on same side. Previous versions had 2 + 1 making the overall profile smaller. This is bigger on the end but since most of them are buried out of sight, it does not matter.Would recommend !","Slim extension cord, perfect for extending power behind furniture","I bought this to access power outlets from behind cabinets when I ran out of outlets in my kitchen. They fit on an outlet behind cabinets. I then ordered more to have an extension cord come from behind my dresser. Normally this calls for pulling it out some for the wall. I was able to return it just as close to the walk for before. I went to look at slim plug cords at local brick and mortar stores, but none were slim enough, not as much as these. They have been reliable with regular grip on plugs so nothing falls out. I can‚Äôt recommend these enough. I am only ordering these from now on, unless I need a surge protector.

I‚Äôve used battery cases for years to be sure I won‚Äôt run out of battery for my phone when I‚Äôm out for extended periods. I live in Western North Carolina and do a lot of motorcycles riding in very remote places in the mountains. I need to have long battery life for my mapping program or should I get stranded.The weakest component I‚Äôve seen on the previous battery cases I‚Äôve owned is the jack. They tend to be wobbly and fail to make good contact after a little while. The jacks on these cases feel like the jacks on my iPhone. The plug snaps in place and is held very firmly.The only downside I feel is that the back surface is not rubberized like the rest of the case and it can slide if set on a smooth angled surface. I put a piece of non slip tape on the back which easily solved that potential problem. I liked the case so much I bought one for my wife‚Äôs iPhone.,"Love this battery case!  Great product, great price!","I needed an iPhone battery case for my new iPhone SE and Apple doesn't make them for that model. I found this battery case on Amazon for about 1/3 the Apple price so I didn't expect it to be a good choice. I was wrong. Fits perfectly, lighter than the iPhone battery case I had for my old iPhone 6, solid feel. One problem I had with the Apple battery case is that, if there was anything else in my pocket, i.e. my wallet, the soft rubbery texture of the case would accidentally pull my wallet out of my pocket at the same time; almost lost my wallet a couple of times. The texture of this case is not tacky so that's not a problem.Unlike the Apple battery, this battery case does not automatically kick in when the phone battery is too low; when you get that phone message, you have to press and hold down the button on the back of the case until the phone powering indicator appears (lightening bolt on top of the battery icon at the top right of the screen. Your phone will then start repowering just as if you had reattached the lightening cable. So this case works a little differently than the OEM Apple battery case but: 1) it's 1/3 the price, and, 2) Apple doesn't make a battery case that will fit the SE so getting a case from Apple is not an option.In short, great product, great price.",Seems a solid product for protection and recharging,"First off, I have had this product for only a week. But if I don't review it now I will likely never get around to it.So far I give this product high marks. The product was delivered within two days which was quicker than expected.For the product; as compared to a prior model I had purchased:Batter life recharge looks to be on par with most. It provides ~1.25 times the full phone charge (iPhone 8).Design is similar (fat back) to most battery cases I like. Ergonomic.The case material is made of harder plastic rather than a previous model which was more rubberized. This seems to me to reduce grip-ability and possible shock absorbing but the prior model cracked and began falling apart so maybe this is a better design.The strong benefit to this model is that the lightning cable fits tight. In a prior model this connection often did not work and the phone did not charge. This does not seem to be an issue with this phone. Immediate connectivity when I plug in for charging.Overall, this model is comparative in price, recharge ability and size. The downside may only be less grip leading to more drops but the tight connection when charging makes that a good trade-off.",Comfortable & Slim Case for a Great Value,"The case is very comfortable with it‚Äôs smooth finish over the battery compartment. I‚Äôm running iOS 14.0 which allows for the double and triple tap functions on the back of the phone. Those functions operate without issues even when the case is on. The case almost doubles the thickness of the phone, but this is a very thin phone to begin with so it‚Äôs not that big an issue for a battery case. Great value compared to other battery cases. Highly recommend this value-price phone battery case.",Not a mophie but it works,"When I first got this case I wrote a bad review: (Case does not allow the phone to charge while the case is charging. The battery life seems extremely short compared to other brands. If I could find a Mophie case for my phone again I would not buy this one.)BUT, after using it a couple months it seems to be getting better. Now it does charge and will recharge my phone. Not just once, but a couple times. Also, it fits snugly and easily slides into my pocket because of the narrower part at the top. Its all one piece which is good and I like the fact that the charging card is the same as my phone. I've also dropped it on concrete a few times with no damage to the phone or the case. So, after living with it a while I would recommend this case.",1596,195,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P5YK942

I've been through one package and the paper works great. I don't notice a tinted blue color as other reviewers mention. It is thin, but it works flawlessly in my printer and sheets pull individually without getting stuck together. If you're using this in a copy machine or for work purposes and require a certain weight/thickness or color, then maybe this isn't for you. However, I never would have noticed a single issue if I hadn't read the reviews beforehand. For the price, it was worth taking a chance.

It's an attractive extension cord with three outlets and a little bit of surge protection. There are better surge protectors, but this one is an inexpensive everyday choice.Incidentally, I am using it with a powerline adapter, and the fact that it has no voltage regulation and relatively brutish surge protection actually makes it a better choice for me.",Need an indoor extension cord?,The Good:-15 foot is great length for most uses-Durable-3 sockets-Good valueThe Bad:-NoneThe Bottom Line:I needed an extension cord and this 15 foot length one is great. I would recommend 15‚Äô over any shorter length because it‚Äôs nice to have the extra length even if you don‚Äôt need it. Overall I would highly recommend as it‚Äôs functional and a good value.,"Looks well done, build and designed. Awesome performance.","NOW NOW NOW these are some awesome power cords. Upon opening the package and feeling the build quality of these YOU KNOW they are built to last. 1600+ watts mean even a fridge would do nothing to these. 13 amps can pass through these and a fridge can use 3-6 amps! The cable is flexible but has stiffness. I hooked on one (got 4 of these) a 55' 4K TV from TCL, a ROKU model, my gaming PC (i5 6500 and RX 470 in a 600 watts power supply) and an Apple TV switching sometimes for a Nintendo Switch. This thing is awesome. The only thing that you can see is the grey cable piece and the beautiful squared angled plug in the wall. Looks so well done and does not get in the way making the setup look ugly or something. Looks well build, done and designed. Will DEFINITELY buy more of this same one when needed.",Extension Cord With Surge Protection,"An extension cord with surge protection, what a terrific idea! No longer do you need to buy a huge surge protector, you can just get this and it gives you three convenient outlets.The low-profile prong is great when you want this plugged flat against the wall, and the braided cord is good at keeping this tangle-free.I think my only question is: how do we know this cord has done its job of protecting your devices from a surge? Does it stop working? It would be great if the manufacturer could clarify.I got two of these and they are very handy around the house. Recommended.",Really very nice.,"It's funny how a little thing like a cloth wrap on the cord can make a product seem so much nicer and higher end. It does slide over itself and across shelf corners where a rubber/plastic cord would get stuck or tangled, so it's practical too. Really, the flat, angled plug on this this is half of what makes it so excellent. I use it behind my turntable/record shelf, and it would probably not fit if it were a standard straight plug.I do really wish that this thing had a master on/off switch like bigger power bars do, but that's a pretty minor gripe. All in all, really nice product.",35995,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BBGM5WH

Colors are decent but not the most saturated overall. I prefer Colorplus 200 for that. At times, some photos can look highly saturated, clear, almost digital. The grain in those moments are very beautiful. Bad for night photography. Best for sunny weather and very soft looking in bright overcast. A forgiving film in overexposure but not for underexposure. Therefore please rate this at iso200, and expose for shadows. If you are in the shade you may consider overexposing by one more stop (increase that aperture), trust me it really holds up well. Great for beginners. The way I see this film is it is great for family events and moments, the way that Kodak gold used to be.",Colorful as EVER!,"After realizing the film I ordered for an event would not arrive in time, I decided to purchase this film and hope for the best. It arrived the day before I needed it. (Yay for Prime!)I've been very impressed by many other Kodak films, but I had never used this particular one. For background, I've been shooting 35mm film for nearly 7 years and have a good understanding of the range of films available.WOW this film is colorful! It was perfect for capturing this already saturated set. There is obvious grain, but it's not overwhelming, and I actually like the vintage aesthetic it lends the photos. It's what you'd expect from 400 ISO film. The price is great as well.I'm happy I bought this film in a pinch, and I plan to use quite frequently from now on!",Wife is happy!,"My wife found her old SLR camera from the 90's and really wanted to take some photos for nostalgia and fun, so I ordered her this film. The film came well packaged, and does not expire until 8/2020. I would recommend getting a a film sighing tool to pull out the film tab from the canister is you only use half the roll, then swap out to black and white, I used to work in a photo lab in the late 90's, and totally forgot that when you rewind the film to use again later is swapping out film types, the end gets pulled into the canister, and you have to fish it out with this little plastic tool they make.",Very good quality film and hard to find in my area,Came in 4 separate boxes instead of one as pictured but that doesn't matter to me they come right out of the boxes into the camera bag anyway. Very good quality film and hard to find in my area. I photograph motorsports events and it has a high enough speed for that and excellent clarity.,Realistic Colors,"I have been shooting color film for about 50 years and have always trusted Kodak to give me realistic colors. I have many very nice film cameras as well as digital cameras, and like the way film has a broader dynamic range than my digital cameras. Living in Vermont I do a lot of scenic photos and pretty much want what I see. Also, with the added expense of processing, I do not like to spend $12 for a roll of film. Granted getting a competent film processor is important for a great photo.",2134,219,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZH40QU

Works via 5V phone plug, doesn't drain power from your computer!","I have a mid-2015 Macbook Pro Retina on which I run Bootcamp to play Windows-compatible games.

Unlike every other laptop pad I researched, this one features fans that SPECIFICALLY RUN FASTER on AC power, rather than by plugging into your computer's USB for power. It only makes sense not to burden your laptop with supplying power when you're trying to keep it cool! Just get a 10-foot male-to-male USB cable and plug it into your iPhone plug (or any plug that's 5 volts), and then plug that into your wall or power strip, and voila, there's the power for your cooling pad.In addition to approving performance, the computer performs better whilst running Mac OS for work, etc., so I use it all the time!

I ordered four to create a LEGO table with LEGO drawer storage and it's perfect!!!",Wonderful!,"Read reviews on this product, good and bad. I took a chance and ordered three cabinets. I assembled them myself. After the assembly of the first cabinet, my husband went out and bought me my own personal electric power tool for the screws....lol. The assembly was easy (for me) especially after I put together the first cabinet. I laid all the wood pieces out, all the screws, cams, what have you, and went to town. I am so impressed with these cabinets. They are sturdy and look nice. The only thing is it won't fit my 12 x 12 craft papers, as the width of the drawers is not 12 x 12, and the height of the cabinet drawers is only about 2.6 inches, which was the only disappointment. I am using these drawers for my craft room. My husband was even impressed at how the finished product looked. Also, they were delivered intact, tightly protected by styrofoam and plastic coverings. No broken pieces, all screws intact, instructions, etc. I would highly recommend. I love them. I will be ordering more products from this company. My advice is to read the instructions carefully or view the pictures carefully. The only things that are labeled are the drawer guards (which will have a RG and LG), but you have to look hard to see them, which was nice. The other pieces are common sense. Just make sure nothing goes on backwards; put the right pieces on the right boards. Also the price was reasonable (I caught a lower price).",Stylish Organization at an Affordable Price,"I Purchased these as a dupe for the Ikea Alex drawers - I am trying to create a custom vanity because my makeup is taking over! They were not hard to put together, although after putting together a few I have some helpful tips:1. Separate into different piles the parts for the drawers.2. The rail systems comes in packages of 4, split them out right side/left side drawer and right side/left side cabinet3. Install the rails to each side of the cabinet before putting it together, trust me on this one!4. Put the cabinet together top first then flip over to put the bottom on. Install the casters, if applicable, at this point5. I put all of the drawer rails on first before putting the drawers together - it made it easier6. Put the drawers in starting from the bottomThe quality of this unit is great,it is a bit smaller than the Ikea version, however, they are also considerably more cost effective (especially considering I have purchased 6 of these so far). I kept the casters on and locked them in place to give the additional height I needed for the vanity. The drawers open and close well, the wheels when not locked down make the unit easy to move. They also have a 7 drawer unit for under $100 (way too high for a vanity), but worked well for other storage. I used one for nail polishes and one for hair product.

This almost discouraged me from purchasing, but I'm glad I did anyway. At first, I couldn't get it to work. But after a few attempts, I came up with a method that works great!Here are instructions for how to use this product:1) Wrap the wire connecting tightly about 6 or 8 times around2) Cut the end of the tape with scissors to leave a clean edge3) Singe the cut end of the tape with a lighter. This will soften the edge and make it sticky.4) Stick the singed edge down onto the tape. Now it should hold together.5) Using a heat gun on LOW setting, blow heat onto the tape.6) As you heat, you will see it go from a flat/matte color to a gloss.7) Continue heating until the whole thing is softened up.8) Remove heat and let it cool. As it cools, the tape will harden upHere's what people do wrong with this product...- Complain that the loose edge doesn't stick (fixed this with lighter trick)- Complain that it doesn't shrink (it does, I laid out an 8 inch strip and it shrunk by 1/4 inch when using the heat gun)- Try to shrink it with a lighter or a heat gun on HIGH (which is too hot and will melt the product)Note that this stuff is much thinner than heat shrink tubing.

A couple of decades ago I was using this stuff by the roll and not giving a thought to it. Insulation was insulation, tape or varnish so what?With the space of time and distance, and a shop of annoying [chuds/clods/kleps], repairs must be made. When that special someone chops the jacket on a tool cord for early release, a few moments and you're handing back the good as new connector. Troubled by draping lines or trip hazards? Wrap and fuse.Never again try to guess AWG or bundle diam. Just wrap and heat. Need cheap insulated tools? Wrap with std tape and overwrap with this.

The cord is broken at various places showing bare wires. I used small pieces of double sided tape to tape both ends of the tape to the cord, double wrapping it around the bare wire areas. Using a heat gun at high and heat shrink the tape to a glossy state and let it cool down. Its result is just like a heat shrinks tubing. Another thing, it is made in America and it works. I highly recommend it.",Works if applied correctly,"The tape does not have any adhesive on it. You have to wrap it around tightly so it stays in place. Apply heat to it and it shrinks up.

When I first unpacked it I didn‚Äôt think it would work because I couldn‚Äôt feel a difference when pressing my hand on it. I put it under my fitted sheet and it really does work! If you place it just right you will always have a cool spot to shift to. It does get warm after a few hours on the same spot but just by rolling over you can find a cool spot. Last night was the first time in a long time that I didn‚Äôt wake up sweating in the middle of the night. If you sleep warm and especially if you have night sweats, this mat is life changing!",Best thing I‚Äôve ever tried for hot flashes,"I was a little nervous when I read the earlier review but was waking up several times every night with hot flashes so I decided to try it anyway. This amazing thing has changed my life ! I don‚Äôt understand how it works but it really works - cold to the touch when you put pressure on it and no wires or batteries. I fold it in half the long way and lay it next to me on my mattress at night. when I start to get hot I just roll over onto it, cool off for a minute or 2, roll off and right back to sleep !",993,121,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MGN0FE0

It's like sitting on a sofa chair, except on the floor.10 out of 5 stars! I highly recommend this floor gaming chair to anyone who are playing video games on the floor or watching TV on the floor. This floor chair will make it more comfortable than sitting on a couch and you can lean by for even more comfort and better viewing angle of the TV screen. The chair is very sturdy and well constructed. A great buy!Hope this was useful... and if it was, please click on the helpful button below. Thank you!",Worth every penny!,"I'm bougie and always ballin on a budget. These were Better than expected! Highly recommend. I ordered these specifically for spiritual healing and gatherings. I had visited other temples where they had similar chairs but they were on the thin side and many of the people became uncomfortable because the chairs were to thin either because of padding or width. These chairs are built really well, are wide enough for a plus size adult and are padded enough that my kids have used them to sleep on. Also, my toddler has used them to jump on/off so I can attest to the fact that they're also very sturdy.",Perfect for playing video games!!!,I bought this fun floor gaming chair for my son for Christmas! We tried it out before Christmas when he wasn‚Äôt around. It is perfect for him because he likes to sit near the floor when he is playing his games! It is soft and just the perfect perfect size for him because he is only 14. It is adjustable to a bunch of different Heights for the back of the chair and it also lays flat! Now we might need another one for dad or friends! Awesome Chair! My son LOVES it!!!!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è,"Comfortable chair, machine washable!",I bought this for reading! It‚Äôs very comfortable. You can adjust it between 0 to 90-degree angle as you want. And then sit in it for a whole day without back pain!The price is lower than the others. But the quality is good! The most important is that you can wash it! I love it! So strongly recommend it for you!,Great for kids!,Bought two of these for my kids reading nook. They work perfectly for lounging and seem pretty sturdy. We even used them for an indoor camp out to sleep on. The cover is a giant PITA to remove to wash with a ton of tied ribbons... BUT it did wash up fine.,269,26,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KL3MRKP

Generally, the most common attributes looked for are Type/Behavior, Actuation Distance, Operating Force, and the Sound Level. What is the difference between Linear and Tactile? Tactile switches have a small tactile bump that provides resistance which can be felt at the point of key actuation. The switch itself is practically inaudible, omitting the click sound present in clicky switches. Tactile switches are versatile performers that cope well with a variety of different typing tasks. Linear switches are coveted for their quiet, smooth action that‚Äôs free of any interference from tactility. Linear switches themselves are close to silent, but easy to bottom out depending on the actuation force required from the spring strength.","{'Product Dimensions': '11.5 x 4 x 1.2 inches', 'Item Weight': '1.2 pounds', 'Manufacturer': 'Matrix Keyboards', 'ASIN': 'B09HG8J12H', 'Item model number': 'KB-ES-WHT/YLW', 'Customer Reviews': '', 'Best Sellers Rank': '', 'Date First Available': '2021-09-28'}",",,PBT Doubleshot Backlit Keycaps: The keycaps are designed with durable PBT material that is resistant to wear, friction, and solvents.

Now the trick is, you need to screw the bars together SUPER TIGHTLY or the drawers will be a little loose. The black washers have a straight side and a curved side. Curved side goes flush with the vertical bars, straight side flush with the shorter horizontal bars.",Be sure to put the washers in the correct place!,"I am so glad I finally purchased this! My 2nd photo shows it empty, but I've since added a lot of craft supplies and I love how I can roll it out of my closet and up to my work table, and then back in place when needed; I have a small craft area so this was important. I was hesitant to purchase this because of the videos showing the drawers ""shaving"" as they were being pulled out and pushed in. But I think I know why this is happening! When I first assembled mine, I forgot about the washers, and I struggled to get the drawers in and they were shaving. Realized what I did, added the washers (easy peasy) and the drawers work perfectly. But that got me thinking... looked at one the videos again, and sure enough, the washers were there, but they were on the outside of the pole, not on the inside which adds space. So if you purchase, be sure you add the washers, and put in the correct spot, see my close up photo. I'm surprised Seville hasn't caught on to this and asked customers about it when leaving a negative review about the drawers not sliding in and out.",The Versatile Large 6-drawer Storage Bin,"The Organizer Cart is perfect for my needs. My bathroom does not have a vanity below the facebowl and I was overcrowding my linen closet with toiletries. Every time that I need an item I had to constantly leave the bathroom to go to the linen closet. The drawers are nice and roomy and you can see the items through the frosted finish. I noticed in the reviews that I read prior to my purchase that some reviewers stated that the cart was difficult to assembly. I am 80 years old and assembled the cart in 20 minutes once I confirmed that all the parts were enclosed in the packaging. Also, it was stated that the cart was wobbly; once the screws are put into the tubes you have to tighten all the screws as tight as they can go. The drawers go in evenly and open and close correctly. Stand it next to a straight line such as a door frame, if it aligns straight it should not wobble. I push mine around when sweeping and mopping and find that my cart is sturdy.",Better than the craft store knock offs.,"This is why you shop around. I see these all the time at Michaels or Joanns for $60-$80, for craft storage (ouch!) for their in-house brands. And their drawers are thin, cheap, + usually come with warped legs.The Seville Classic is much better.I use this item all the time, in my office - It's the same design, same size, at a much better quality and pricepoint than the retail stores. Prime Delivery, sturdy design, and more color/drawer options to choose from. I like the black for a more professional setting, and also gradient gray or steel options.I got mine on a lightning deal, and it was well worth it.Pros: Original price point is still cheaper than Retail Craft Stores. And it goes on sale fairly often online.Perfect for organizing office supplies, with easy access. Color drawer quality is true to life - (which is a real problem with a lot of listings that hike up the saturation in photos to make them look nicer) very vibrant in person, as in the pictures. Can be used free standing or with the wheels. Drawer shelf knobs optional, and easy to customize if you want to switch them out. I actually put in my own which are crystal, for an extra highlight.Cons: If you need to pack it up, it is not easy to disassemble, for moving. Or using on-the-go. Once you've built it, you just have to keep it, as is. It's usually just for a 1 room purpose. But, added mobility to take on the go would have been nice (Maybe just my personal preference).",Company has great customer service üëçüèº,"So, firstly I should say that I rarely take time to leave reviews. I ordered this cabinet to store paint supplies because I thought it would be fairly decent looking and roll easily if need be. It was easy enough for my husband to put together. I will say however that once together the frame seems that either it is straight and the drawers are not, which does not seem quite likely, or the frame is not and the drawers are‚Äîeither way‚Äîsomething is not quite right so now that it is all together some of the drawers do not quite slide in and out easily. Hubs plans to spray with some sort of silicone something or another and see if it helps. Anyway. I will say this, one of my drawers was damaged in transit‚ÄîI do not hold this against the company, so I emailed them to give them a chance to replace it. They asked that I provide proof of purchase which I did of course and they immediately mailed me another drawer. The piece fits in the space well, the drawers are useful, I like that it rolls, and I like the top being metal. It lends to the ‚Äòindustrial loft‚Äô aesthetic I was wanting for the space.",11684,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08R5X3L71

First I had to confirm what I had wasn‚Äôt any of that black market shady stuff that‚Äôs been infiltrating the market. I mean how dare the kids of today not know what true real paper is. I remember when I was a kid..... alright enough of that next I‚Äôll be saying I walked uphill in snow both ways to school, but we had real paper.... ok sorry back to my fact finding mission. So I decided to go find old books. Feel, smell and against my better judgment (if I have any) taste test some to see what the quality‚Äôs were that I so desired in my basic everyday needs of white paper to print on. Well one thing I can say is don‚Äôt eat old paper it taste gross, I mistook them for those cool Candy dots on paper things when I was a kid many many years ago. Anyone remember those and Somehow you‚Äôd always end up eating some of the paper, but wasn‚Äôt an issue.... hmm maybe I should visit that factory to see what they desireD in paper to put candy on.In conclusion I came to the realization of why am I writing a review for paper at 3am on a Saturday instead of sleeping, so since I am, I will make it long as possible to see who actually reads this all oh yea and Amazon reviews all reviews not sure if they got a basement full of gremlins just sitting their reading what we type or some computer system that picks up on certain things and rejects based upon that? Either way if they have gremlins doing the work, I wonder if they print out their review decisions and what they think of normal basic white paper???? either way have a great day whenever you read this wherever you are and if you need some basic white paper to print on, I guess this should fit your needs.","Excellent paper, good value.","I‚Äôve seen a number of negative reviews on this product for a variety of reasons, mostly for damaged shipments. In my opinion, that problem doesn‚Äôt belong in a review of the product. That complaint needs to be addressed to Amazon. I purchased a 5 ream box of this paper, shipped in a well padded over box, and received undamaged inside or outside.The paper is very good in quality and weight. It works perfectly in my Canon laser printer and never jams. Be sure to pay attention to the instruction for which side to load up in your paper tray. It may make a difference in how the paper works in your printer or copier. For quality prints, this is a great paper at a good value, including two-sided printing. The only paper I will ever use in my printer/copier.",Excellent for printing both sides with an inkjet printer. Photos don't bleed through.,"I just took on the responsibility of publishing the monthly newsletter for my astronomy club. I wanted to print the newsletter on both sides and also wanted to include lots of photos. I'm using an inkjet printer, and most printer papers I've used would bleed through the paper wherever there's a photo. This paper does not bleed through. Excellent",Best paper for inkjet printers,"My inkjet printer paper of choice for 10 years. The 24-pound weight greatly cuts down on jamming, as inkjet rollers get a better grip than they do on standard 20-pound copy paper. The bright white finish makes color images really pop, and there's far less ink soaking when duplex printing is used. There are brands with equal quality, but cost way more. Hammermill gives me top paper at a better price.",Good & Plentiful,"I'm loving this choice. The paper is sturdy and bright and the five reams are a great choice because I use a lot of paper. Printing on this paper is a total upgrade from the regular 20-pound, flimsy paper I used for years. Watch out for price changes, however, but still, the cost is lower area stores, and delivery to your home or business is a much better option than transporting a somewhat heavy box.

I use it for all my home printing needs...letters, documents, photocopies, faxes, etc. But I also use it to line our 10 bird cages. No joke. While most people think newspaper is the obvious choice for that, bird owners may disagree. My female lovebirds are notorious paper shredders and they regularly make confetti of their cage lining. I don't like the idea of them chewing on ink or any kind of color print. And we have two cockatoos who also shred their cage paper and then roll around, playing with their toys, at the bottom of their cages until their snow white feathers would turn a dingy grey from newspaper print. Although newspaper might be less expensive, cockatoo shampoo ain't cheap and wrestling them in the shower on a weekly basis isn't a whole lotta fun either.

The fit is good thanks to the tips angle and the curved cord connector and the flexible fit thing (don't know what it's called) keeps a solid and comfortable fit in the ear.The sound quality is also impressive, highs and lows are very clear and pronounced as is expected with Skullcandy and the mids aren't too bad either, but not to the quality of Symphonized in ears.

Mic works perfect. I've had these for a while now and literally the only thing I could say about them that isn't necessarily positive is that after you wear them for an extended period of time, and I mean like 3+ hours nonstop, they do start to make your ears sore.

Produces 220+ degrees while drawing approximately 17 watts and has plenty of cord.,Used as directed...Warms beverages perfectly!,"I took into consideration 2 specific reviews. 1.) The person who intentionally left their warmer on overnight, unattended with the end result of the warmer melting and burning into their counter (duh!) and 2.) Another who suggested using a silicone beverage cover to retain heat. That being said, as a precaution I placed a stone coaster with a cork bottom under my warmer and also purchased a silicone beverage cover from BBB (they also sell them on Amazon) as to deter loss of heat through evaporation. I the conducted an experiment where I filled my coffee mug with room temp coffee and creamer from the fridge and placed my mug with cover on burner. Within 45 minutes my coffee was comfortably warm, not scolding but perfectly toasty to cuddle up with and drink with easy. Beats microwaving. I recommend for those who always get to their drinks after they have cooled. And for the price, I bought 2. One for the living room and one for my nightstand.",Works great! Just add a foil mug topper.,"Prior to purchasing this mug warmer, I read the reviews, and I wasn't sure if this product could my coffee hot enough. I have a large stoneware mug (16 oz. capacity). Turns out, the mug fits fits nicely on the warmer, and my coffee does stay hot. I made a little aluminum foil cover for my coffee mug, to keep a ""film"" from forming on the top of my coffee (I use heavy cream in my coffee). Not only does the foil cover keep a film from forming, it prevents heat from rising from the mug. My coffee stays nice and hot for as long as it takes me to finish it, which can take an hour or more. When my coffee is partially gone, the mug warmer makes the remaining coffee almost too hot to drink! Get this warming plate and make a simple foil cover for your mug; your coffee will stay hot! Another thing: There is no heat buildup under the warming plate. I have it sitting directly on my desk top and the wood feels barely warm from the product.",Had it over a year!,"It's going on a little over a year since I got this coffee warmer & I felt I needed to let everyone know that this is the best coffee warmer I've gotten. I work 7 am to 5 pm and it is on the entire time, 5 to 6 days a week. It keeps my tea at just the right temperature. Not scalding or room temperature like other warmers I've purchased.The 60 inch cord is long enough to go across my large desk. The hot plate is 3.25 inches in diameter, making it the right size for even my large bottomed coffee mug. The entire warmer is 5.2 by 8.6 inches, so it's not cumbersome having it sit on my desk. This was a great purchase, I'm glad I got it.** I did not receive this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my review. I do not anticipate any problems with it's performance in the future, however, should I experience any adverse issues I will come back and update this review accordingly.",like all the others I see advertised too,"OK, I read a number of the reviews posted here before purchasing this mug warmer, and did a little research to check what the power used (wattage) was supposed to be. The manufacturers seem to want to keep this a mystery for some reason -- all of them. There were reports that this Mr Coffee device had the same wattage rating as other similar mug warmers that had decent feedback ratings. So, I decided to try it. The power number mentioned was 17 watts, which sounds about right for a device this size. The watts of power generated is THE most important characteristics of any heat producing device and this Mr Coffee mug warmer seems to live up to the purported 17 Watt rating.They don't put any power or energy information anywhere on the packaging material and there is no information in the small instructions pamphlet either but the bottom off the device says: ""120 V 60 Hz 17 W"", so, 17 watts it is.Now, if this electrical device consumes around 17 watts, you can assume some of the heat energy is lost to the table and the edges of the plastic housing and if you put your hands around the device, there is some loss there and my desk beneath does get a little warm. So, clearly 17 watts is not going into the cup. But for such a simply made device, like all the others I see advertised too, it appears to generate a majority of the heat energy at the indented area where the cup will sit.And by the way, the heating are where a mug sits is 3-1/4 inches in diameters -- which will accommodate some pretty big mugs.The depressed area where your coffee mug sits gets noticeably warmer than the sides of the device. It is hot but not so hot I can't touch it. I wouldn't want to hold my fingers there for very long but it's not like its glowing red. It's touchable.So, I took it out of the packaging, plugged it in, set a cup of coffee on it, and did a little work -- like maybe twenty minutes.The coffee was a bit cold to start, not even cool, and when I picked the mug up a little later the coffee was warm, the mug was warm..The mug warmer doesn't heat it to a hot coffee temperature but check it's name -- it isn't supposed to. It ""warms"" the coffee.As a couple of reviews pointed out, the manufacturers are skirting the boundary of generating enough heat to make it dangerous to be left heating on a desk. You can't have a relatively small, inexpensive plastic device have a red-hot burner on it, not when it's intended use is sitting next to my monitor amidst piles of note and maybe near a textbook or two.If you want really hot coffee, clear a space on your desk and get a true hot plate with which you can also fry bacon. Or get a small stand to hold a microwave. After all that, I was quite pleased with how effective it was in ""warming"" a drink.If you want it to make your coffee hot hot, you will be disappointed. If you want your coffee to stay warm, it does it's duty.",39381,6,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000CO89T8

I probably won't be able to use it as much as I thought because it's so strong. But it's so good that I don't mind, because this is the type of massage I would normally only go out for once or twice a year, and I'll use this much more often than that.The air option on the back and sides is HEAVEN.

Heat: AWESOME Overall...if you suffer...Get. Period.I looked for almost a year for a massage chair pad thing. My back issues are so severe...I'm not jumping. I did a lot of research on these things...and after many days of going over reviews and prices, and haggling within myself... After a year of being very careful, I bought this.I have severe back pain. There are days I cannot walk. After all my kids got past 10 months, I could no longer pick them up. I am allergic to every pain med available. This thing is a true and precious miracle in my life. It is not a cure...but it is beyond words ....amazing. The rollers can go clock/counter clock wise...which I prefer. I ADORE the heat...which does take a few to get nice and warm...but it REALLY works. It all really really works. Look...I only write reviews on things that are so so very bad...or so extremely awesome, I really have to share. If you're like me...and have a painful 'sweetspot' in the epidural area...this thing is just a miracle. Thoracic Outlet, cancer surgery down my back, 2 near death csection, bucked off horses, working my body to hell and back to pay bills...Get it. I have never been without pain, to see how much I was actually in. The air seat features, to which you can set intensity, feels like a hug around the lower back...a secure, wonderful hug. The only con...no timer....and its a good thing, or I'd live on this massage pad.PS: I am 5ft 2in. Im not a skinny by anyone's standards, and it works. My husband is 5ft 8in and it works for him too. It Really Works.",This is better than a personal masseuse !!,"I have had an aching back for years and the last few years I have been waking up with cramps in my neck that make it almost impossible to turn my head for a few hours after waking. My wife has been harping on me to by a shiatsu massager and so I went online to read reviews on various brands and ""COMFIER"" had by far the best reviews and lots of them, so I sent off for the ""Comfier Shiatsu Neck & Back Massager ‚Äì 2D/3D Kneading Full Back Massager with Heat & Adjustable Air Compression"" which is model CF-2309A. I was excited when it arrived and had already set my couch up, (where I sit with my dog), and quickly unpacked the massager and set it up on the couch and plugged it in. (I am sorry but I did not even read the instructions at first because I just wanted to test it out!) WOW! This thing is amazing!! It has got so many bells and whistles that I had forgotten all of the different massage functions, but WOW!! The shiatsu balls that run up and down your back are positioned exactly where you need the massage, on either side of your spine, turning and rolling up and down and massaging your whole back in a way that is so relaxing. The massage balls can be changed to just roll up and down without turning around, which copies the motion of a massuese rolling their hands or fists up and down your back. I could do it for hours on end! (Though after actually reading the instructions they state that you should not use it for more than 15 minutes at a sitting so you won't overstimulate your muscles and nerves. Next let me tell you about the neck massager part. I am not the tallest person out there but the neck massager massages my neck perfectly because it can be raised or lowered at the touch of a button. So I set it for the lowest height. The shiatsu balls rotate either clockwise or counter clockwise at the touch of a button and the heat (which is in the neck and the back massage balls) helps your muscles to expand and release any pinched nerve that I have. The other thing that the Comfier Shiatsu massage does that I did not see on ""any other neck and back massager"" is air bladders that inflate and press on the sides of you back that feels so good and gives me the feeling of sitting in a super expensive sports car seat that fits you so snug and tight. To sum this up, I could go down the street and pay a professional massuese $45.00 per half hour or use the ""Comfier Shiatsu Neck & Back Massager ‚Äì 2D/3D Kneading Full Back Massager with Heat & Adjustable Air Compression"" model CF-2309A and get better results without spending an arm and a leg, and the added benefit is you can get a massage whenever ""you"" feel like it. In the morning, noon or before you go to sleep. In one word, WOW!!",Easy use,"I‚Äôve been using this massage chair for almost a month, and for five minutes a day , the pain in my shoulder has eased . It‚Äôs easy. I like it so far. Recommend it to those in need!",Comfy and Relaxing,"Great massager that relieves my soreness from sitting by the computer all day. All functions work just like described. I love the neck part of the massager because I can move it up and down to adjust it to where my neck is as well as massage the top of my shoulder. Personally, my back doesn't bother me that much, so I don't have the best say in how the back massage works. However, I think that it is excellent, it has three different modes to choose from and also has heating. Overall, very comfortable and relaxing. Don't regret buying and would definitely recommend this product to others.",13712,4,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JH7GS76

I used a micron in the wrong place and would have had to do the entire project, about 9 hours worth, completely over. Not only did the eraser arrive on time, it came early when I desperately needed it. I prayed it would work and sure enough! It cleaned off ALL of the ink! And, it did not damage the paper so I can easily re-create that part of the drawing. I will be purchasing a two pack just to make sure I have a spare.

This was the reason I bought this white sand eraser after it was recommended by Jennifer McGuire in one of her crafty videos. I highly recommend!!",Handy set of erasers!,"Great set of erasers!

I think this was a great deal for two and replacement erasers as well.",You'll never go back.,"If you do fine, detailed drawings, you won't know what you ever did without these. Mono plastic erasers are the best, cleanest erasers on the market by a long shot. Definitely order a few of the chunky ones too, because they'll take out a whole area of pencil without leaving a trace or damaging the paper. The pen-style erasers are a level of insanity beyond even those: they're so good that they're drawing tools in and of themselves, not just drawing-removal tools. Want to delicately draw highlights on your pencil drawing? Need to put a glimmer on a few individual strands of hair? I've been using the round one for many years, but now the rectangular tip has proven indispensable as well, not only because it bridges the gap between a block eraser and a fine tip, but again for the actual shape of the highlight. It's like a negative chisel-tipped marker.This is at least my fifth time buying these erasers, because I plant them in all my bags, pockets, and work spaces, lest I should need one when it's not there. Nothing else works.",Erase with pin point accuracy. Even colored pencils.,"I finally have had some time to really try these out. They work amazingly well, getting into the tiniest little places. There is a learning curve, you have to be patient. Very much like erasing typewriter ink from onion skin copy paper, back in the day. You go slowly stroking the paper gently, too much pressure just wears down the rubber & slides over the pigment. I did find more thorough results were to be had if the pencil mark is fresh, but even day or two old pigment, will come off light enough to be covered by layering the color you want over the shadow. I've been using them on my oil based pencil sets, so I will have to test my theories on my wax based pencils. They await the arrival of a Can of fixative at this time. These pens were on a deal at the time & I scored on a refill deal, & I am so glad I did, they are worth every penny & the short delay to get here. (from Japan) I love them, thanks to all the positive reviewers for persuading my they would be a good investment, and the guy who advised getting extra refills at the same time. I recommend these, even for coloring, for those little slips you make when tired. They do work best on the spot & are quite successful. They really are great & very comfortable to hold. MaryAnn Coy-Schuerger.","Very precise erasing & highlighting, love them!","Love these, how have I managed all these years of art without them!I bought the set of two, a round one & a rectangular one, & use both of them quite a bit, in sketching, drawing & coloring. The eraser material is stiff enough not to be floppy, but not hard enough to tear through the paper. I can get very precise with erasing & use them to add highlights as well. I usually use an electric eraser, but these are MUCH better for closeup & controlled work. There isn't much eraser in each, & the refills are small too, so I try to use them only when needed. This would be my only issue with them. Other than that, I love them!",A must have for any pencil artist!! But maybe not this seller.,"UPDATE- September 2019-I have always use erasers and have gotten exceptional results. I ordered these erasers in February 2019 and didn‚Äôt use them for a while as I still had an eraser or two to use up. when I did open the pack and start using them it took me a while to realize that the issues I was having was my eraser. Before my Tombow erasers were always form. I could use sandpaper to rub them to a point and make fine lines. These new erasers were very soft making it very difficult to get fine lines. This is just about ruined a portrait I‚Äôve been working on of a tiger. As I always do my drawing first and come back in and erase my whisker lines and my fine ear hair, this did not work with these new erasers. This caused me to try several different techniques to make this work which was very difficult as I was trying to erase very fine lines from very dark graphite. I still have not figured out how to fix this and it is very upsetting as this was up till this point looking to be one of my best drawings yet. So I don‚Äôt know if this is a reflection of Tombow, or the seller. But I won‚Äôt buy from them again.I absolutely love these erasers! They are amazing! I use them almost exclusively. Use the round one on a sandpaper block to get a real nice tip and you can use it to make fine whiskers, hair, etc. Doing the same also allows you to erase and clean up even in the smallest nooks and crannies of your drawing.The only time I do not use a Tombow Mono is if I am erasing large portions, in which I use a kneaded eraser.

I decided to give the standing desk thing a try, but I wasn't going to spend $250+ on one. So I came up with the idea of just having a high desk, and a high stool to change my position throughout the day from standing to sitting. My old desk was very cheap and small, it needed an update. This folding table is a lot more durable, and it gives me enough room for my things. I bought a side table and put it underneath, where it holds my Mac mini and my CPU tower is on the floor. I have a floor mat for when I stand, and my high stool is tucked in under the table for when it's not in use.Keep in mind that the highest this table will go is 36in, I'm only 5""3 so it works well for me.

At first I did not like the fact that it could not be hung up on the wall with the charger plugging into it like my previous dustbusters. I didn't have extra tabletop space to store it flat. But once I found a spot for it, it is nice to just rest it on its base and not deal with wires and decisions -- to connect to charger or not. It just is always fully charged. I have not yet experienced it running out of power during a pickup session -- altho I do tend to just use it for quickie pickups. I plan to push its limits in the future to see just how long it can run on a full charge. The fact that it is Lithium Ion is great that it should last longer and perform better than previous nicad batteries. After a few years, the old style dustbusters just don't take a charge well.FYI, I used two fat J-shaped hooks mounted a few inches apart on the wall to create a platform for the vac.

I wanted something rustic for some of the more glamorous pieces around it. It was fairly easy to assemble and came packaged well.,Worth it!,"This piece is prettier than I originally expected and much more substantial. I didnt use it for my bathroom, but it works for a small seated corner in my living area. I wanted something that looked nice but was still small and unobtrusive. This fit the bill.It took roughly an hour to put together but t that was only because the back panel had 10 screws and no predrilled screw holes. That wasn't fun, but the instructions were easy to follow and it was well packaged and seems solid and sturdy. No complaints!","Very cute, sturdy bookcase!","Love the final product.. looks classy, rustic and solid in person. *Hurt my fingers when scewing in some of the hardest parts because I had to press soo hard, so not the easiest thing to put together, hence the missing star.. I just took finger breaks and then wore gardening gloves which helped.. Altogether it took about 3 1/2 hours to assemble.Also I had a problem with the bottom left shelf door- it was lower than the right door, making the whole thing look sloppy and cheap when set up straight and closed.. so I got creative and tied a small hairtye around the bottom round prong on door that fits into the hole on the floor piece and that actually worked to bring its height up to match the right door so now they are even!So after conquering these challenges, I am happy with it. The bottom doors shut and open easily with the magnet. Overall good quality, stylish product! Thanks",Perfect for small bathroom!!!!,This little cabinet is perfect for a small bathroom with no storage. Fits snugly against wall and it is unbelievable how much storage it offers. It is smaller than I thought but it is my fault I didn't pay more attention to measurements. Any larger and it would not have fit. Beautiful white finish and wooden top.

This is perfect was able to see at a glance what I have and need.,Great for storing your batteries.,"If you have a bunch of batteries sitting in boxes, blister packs, or an open container, this will help you organize them and find them later. The case is big and provides a good AA-heavy storage setup. The included tester is a great addition, and let me know which ones to throw away or recharge instead of just storing them. It holds the batteries securely in place but still keeps them easy to extract. The plastic feels well constructed and tough, but I can't speak to long-term yet.There is space for a few small improvements though:1. There's only one place where you can put coin/watch/button cell batteries: a small sealable spot about the size of a deck of cards. I have multiple types of button cells, and it would be nice to have some ability to organize them better.2. Most, if not all, of the slots on the ""front"" have a hole on the bottom. if you accidentally drop something small into one, it can easily fall through and start rattling around inside, and would be difficult to extract. If the bottoms were sealed, this wouldn't be a problem.Also, in our house, we use way more rechargeable AA batteries than disposables of any type, and have virtually nothing that uses C or D cells. If I were redesigning this to make it perfect for me, I'd get rid of about half of the C and D storage and provide a spot to hold one of the many 4-cell AA chargers available.",39542,3,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089F9YDFC

The reviews are true about this one!,"I prewired my new construction home for 14 speakers. I moved in December and since then have been doing tons of research on in-wall / in-ceiling speakers. I was ready to spend about 1.5-2k on more commonly known brand name models (Polk, Boston acoustics, Klipsch, etc..). Then I came across these on Amazon and thought i would gamble with a set of 5 to see how they would sound in my living room. I have 10ft ceilings so i went with 8' 3-way speakers while using 16 guage speaker wire. Needless to say, this is one of the best, and a bit lucky purchases i have made in a while.My only gripe is installing the cover grill once you have secured the speaker to the wall. The first speaker took me about 1 hour to install, but the rest went by much easier once I got better with the drywall saw and knew the exact size the hole needed to be. Reinstalling the grill cover was a challenge mainly due to the fact that after you have mounted the speaker to the ceiling the plastic frame may have warped ever so slightly. If your hole is too snug it will warp the frame just enough to make the grill hard to fit. So, I grabbed a pair of needle nose pliers and made a crease on the lip of the grill cover (the part that's folded up that wedges into the housing). I just grabbed about 1/4 inch of the lip and turned about 90 degrees and repeated on 4 sides. this reduces the circumference by some millimeters to make the grill fit in a little easier. Be careful not to twist too much.After install was complete i hooked up my speakers to my onkyo receiver and played some tunes on stereo mode so i can stand below each speaker and was immediately impressed. Good bass, mids and highs. I added a 10"" sub to give the movie effects that added boom factor.Im looking forward to buying the other 9 speakers i need at the fraction of the price of the higher end brands. I will save about 1.5k with these speakers!",Pleasantly surprised by price and quality!,"I bought these for an in-ceiling surround sound install. They were a fraction of the price of a set of speakers I had already bought at an electronics store.I saw these on amazon, read the amazing reviews, did some research online, and decided to take a shot on them. I am glad I did. These are great speakers and I don‚Äôt know how they are sold so cheap but believe me, the reviews are honest.",Bang for your BUCK!,"These speakers are simply bad ass! for the money. We have a home theater in which we have a name brand speaker system installed, which cost $700+ for (5.2). These speakers produce sound that is up there with the much more expensive set. We installed these in the patio and are absolutely enjoying these! Paired with a Sony/Yamaha 5.2 Receiver these work awesome. The sound is not lacking ever, when you are listening to music is perfect and when you are watching a movie its even better!.!! Crisp 3 dimensional sound when watching a movie outside is simply awesome. These are rated for both inside and outdoor use I am glad we choose to give these.",Seriously understated sound and quality performance.,"The speakers sound way better than I ever expected. Being an 8"" three-way speaker, there is a great full bass and great highs as well. I have a 5.2 surround sound system and I don't have my subs yet. I set up my Sony receiver for 5.0 because it was an option and it sounds very full. I may not even bother with a sub for a while. For this price or any, the value and sound performance is greatly underestated. I would recommend to anyone. Build Quality is good too. The only con I would say is that there is no sticky strips to help grilles stay in. I just bent mine out slightly so they would have more pressure in the opening.",I decided to move forward with installing them and I'm glad I did,"I hooked these up to my receiver to test the audio quality and wasn't impressed.

Would be extraordinary if the long sides were sealed like a tube.,Good product. Solid value for the money. Very easy to use. Does the job.Improves:1. I was looking for a 100 gauge but had to go with the thinner 75 gauge instead. The 100gauge has a little more rigidity then the 75.2. The roll is a fold over (which I was aware of).

I'm sure there's no issues with the window sealer and that it will do what it is intended to do if the right tool is used.I just wanted to share with anyone interested in buying this item to invest in a heat gun, so it can do what it's intended for; stopping air leaks.",Great Quality and Value,"Exactly what I was looking for to fill a void in my shrink-wrap needs.

Wow, a great scanner.","Works, works well and pretty intuitive to use. OCR a big upgrade from my Epson scanner.","TLDR; Works, works well and pretty intuitive to use.First of all there is a version without the touchscreen, if you use it often, the touchscreen is worth the extra money.Works with 2.5 and 5 GHz or you can connect with USB too.As a teacher, I have found these scanners to be very useful during remote teaching. I have an Epson, but it has some issues with scanning anything that is not a regular sheet of paper.This scanner has been a huge upgrade, mostly because the software, both the one for the PC and the software in the machine that you control from the touchscreen are such a big upgrade. After you get it set up from the front screen you canScan to folderScan to emailScan business cardsScan receiptsSend to the cloudSometimes I need to scan a doc and upload it to the web. The OCR recognition is also a step up from my Epson, and this means I spend less time fixing errors in stuff I have scanned for students. I am actually not sure why, the software ABBYY Finereader is the same, but this scanner makes about half the errors of my older Epson.Folded up this has a pretty small footprint, you do need room to extend the holder for the scanned paper vertically and horizontally for the paper after it is scanned.My Epson tends to shoot the paper out and off the scanner, this one does not. Paper stays on the scanner.When you open the scanner it turns on (the top part)It will mark blank pages so you can either delete during scanning, or if you prefer do it yourself.It detects if a page is in color, even if mixed in with black and white pages!In theory it does 40 pages per minute, and this is really close in real life. I got about 42 pages, 36 pages and 43 pages in three trials. Set on ‚Äúbetter‚Äù mode. You can set normal, better, best or excellent (this noticeably slows it down, I got about 9 ppm on excellent mode).It does better with crinkled pages, but will still jam occasionally if the paper is not flat and smooth.You can save to PDF, searchable PDF or JPEG.You can set up what they call profiles to send whatever you scan to a specific folder, so for example receipts could go to one file in the cloud while business card go elsewhere. You can choose you own icons. You also can set up for up to 5 people having their own set of icons.Cons:Not really for things like photos. They look ok, but nothing like the original photo in quality. This is for docs, for practical usage.No ethernet port.Does not support TWAIN / ISIS","Fantastic Scanner, highly recommended.","I bought my first one of these about 12 years ago, and it lasted this long, trouble-free. It has enabled me to be essentially paper-free from all of the miscellaneous documents we have to deal with in our everyday lives - bank, financial and insurance records, invoices, receipts, medical records and authorizations, and on and on. I kept waiting for my original to break down so I could get a new one, but it just wouldn‚Äôt die üòº. Finally, it stopped feeding properly, so I was able to get the iX1600. This appears to be as well built as the older model, but is noticeably faster. They are great little workhorses for personal and small business uses. The only criticism I have is that there are multiple options of scanning, document management, and OCR software applications to choose from and their web site to make it less confusing to find and choose the appropriate one. The main ones are ScanSnap Home, the all-in-one doc management system, and ScanSnap Manager which basically does the scanning using different profiles you set up, and works with separate apps to do the OCR and other ancillary functions, such as business card reading/management. It leaves you to set up and use your own document management system. The latter works best for me since I already had a useable system and workflow set up.Before I bought this iX1600 unit, I got the previous iX1500 model. I had to return it because it froze up after a firmware update, that wasn‚Äôt easily rectified. That did give me a chance to use their support services which I can now say is excellent.",A quantum leap improvement over its predecessors,"This is the third ScanSnap I‚Äôve purchased in 11 years. I love these scanners for their compact size, high quality and convenience. But the ix1600 is the biggest improvement I‚Äôve seen over its previous generations.It scans at remarkable speeds with minimal jamming and amazing smarts (detected a piece of paper that was thicker than the rest of the pages scanned and asked me to confirm that it didn‚Äôt skip pages by taking in too many at once).And I love being able to share this scanner with multiple computers in my household, although the ScanSnap Home software could be slightly more intuitive to use with a Wi-Fi connected ix1600.",Best scanner I've ever owned,"I've owned scanners from Visioneer, Canon, Epsom, and Brother over the years. I've been eyeing the Fujitsu Scansnap for years due to the rave reviews. I finally got one -- and wish I'd done this years ago!The Fujitsu Scansnap ix1600 is an astonishing device. I‚Äôve been scanning historical estate-related papers from a 100 year span‚Äîoddly-sized, wrinkled, all lengths and widths, and awful quality originals (faded, smudged, etc). The result? Effortless, lightning-fast, and the scans are more-readable than the originals!My setup is an iMac on Catalina connected via the included high-speed USB cable. Scans can be started either from the scanner itself (using the front panel) or the Mac. Both methods work with no issues. I've also tested the WiFi scanning, which works fine, too. It might have been document-specific, but it seemed like Wifi scanning takes a little longer to process at the end of the scan than the wired connection, so I've left it wired.The only possible area of improvement is the outfeed after scanning. When scanning large documents (eg up to the maximum of 50 or so pages), the papers on the outfeed holder do no line up neatly. If you aren't paying attention, the scanned document pages may shift around and get layered out of order. This isn't a problem for me, as I shred everything immediately after scanning, but might be annoying if you're retaining the originals afterwards.I expect that this may be a lifetime scanner. It's clearly more-expensive than the usual mid-market MFC inlet/laser versions. I think it is more than worth it! Highly recommended!",1552,269,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PH5Q51P

The difference in the build quality is obvious. These also have a reduced visual impact because they have a clever full coverage magnetic grill (Polk has a plastic bezel around the edge which is more noticable). Yahama has also enclosed the electronics so no concerns with insulation dust impacting performance (Polk electronics are exposed). Yamaha uses gold plated high force spring connections (Polk uses cheap tin plated push ins).The sound is clear and crisp on these Yamahas with plenty of punchy depth. These speakers are capable of generating quite a bit of bass which is most notable in the floor above. Upstairs it sounds like a subwoofer when the volume is cranked up. I've experienced zero distortion at loud volumes. At the same time the sound quality is not sacrificed at lower background volumes either. I'm also impressed with how efficient these speakers are. They are much louder at the same volume than the theater solutions in ceiling speakers at my last house.A couple of tips for installation. If you are doing a new build get the rough in brackets. Not only do they make the drywall cutouts a breeze but they also distribute the force of the toggle screws across more sheetrock area. I feel this makes a difference in the longevity of the sheetrock with all the vibrations. Get the brackets from HTD for $10 each. They are the best and cheapest you will find and they fit like a glove on these Yamahas.For new build I also recommend building an enclosure in the ceiling with joist sized dimensional lumber. Then stuff with mineral wool insulation to limit noise transmission to the floor above and to smooth out the bass response.Overall I'm very pleased with the Yamahas. It's a huge difference in sound and build quality from comparably and cheaper priced speakers. I'm sure there is some difference with B&W and other brands selling speakers for $300 each... but I wasn't willing to spend the time or money to find out.,the home theater guy sold me some ARIA IC614 in-ceiling speakers and told me they were fantastic. They were OK but I always felt,"In my previous home, the home theater guy sold me some ARIA IC614 in-ceiling speakers and told me they were fantastic. They were OK but I always felt something was lacking. I paid around $160 per speaker back then.In my new home, I resolved to not cheap out. I decided to get the NSIC800WH 6 speaker set. Could not believe they ended up around only $100 a speaker and I would have a spare to boot.I played some music and I was absolutely shocked that these speakers could actually pump out some bass. There was some thump!Coupled with my Polk subwoofer the sound fills the room very well and is extremely cohesive.Extremely satisfied.",Why buy anything else?,"I bought these for our new construction home that we had pre-wired for speakers in several rooms. Installation is easy as other reviewers say. The clamp system to hold the speaker wires made it a simple task to connect to the speakers. I used caution when tightening the tabs that hold the speaker in place, since I had read that other brands easily break. No problems here and the process to secure the speaker in place was better than expected. I try to be handy and usually take longer than most DIYers but I surprised my wife with the small amount of time it took to put these up. The magnetic grill holds strong but is easy to remove and place. It provides a clean look without any logos and since our ceiling is white, there was no need to paint them (which I think you can do). I did a quick set up with the receiver and they sound great. I even had to lower the initial volume level for the receiver because it was so much louder than the set of Sony Floorstanding speakers I previously had. Once I find my microphone, I will go through the optimization process with the receiver and see how it really performs. This was just the family room but I may end up using these speakers for the rest of the house. So far I am happy, but will have to update after these are broken in and optimized.","Amazing sounding speakers, made it through their first winter!!","I'm writing this review after about 10 months of having installed these on the ceiling of my front porch. These speakers sound fantastic, and have held up through one of the worst Pennsylvania winters in recent memory!! I fired them up again a few days ago and they sound just as good as when I installed them last spring.I have worked professionally with music and audio, and the detail you get from these is top notch. These are easily on par with cheaper studio monitors used for critical listening, which is amazing considering they have plastic cones that are made to withstand the elements.I made a little WiFi streaming setup for my porch with these using a Lepai LP-2020a+ and a Dayton Audio WBA31 from Parts Express. (The amp is not actually the best choice out there anymore, I just wanted to hear the original standard for Class D mini amps.) You could also run a Bluetooth amp like the Fosi BT20A or AIYIMA A03 on its own if you just want Bluetooth connectivity and don't care about streaming Spotify or Tidal. And you can run an Echo device to stream audio instead of the WBA31, and use the aux output to run to an amp of your choice.Hook up these speakers to an amp like the AIYIMA A07 or Topping MX3 or Loxjie A10 and you'd have a pretty bumping, reasonably high quality outdoor setup for not a ton of money.",Superb Audio Quality,"I bought two pairs of these for my living room surround sound. I have a dedicated home theater, but we of course use the living room the most. When the house was built, speaker wires were ran in the ceilings already, but not to the walls. The holes were about 20 inches away from the wall.Not wanting to run wires to the walls or mount speakers on the ceiling, I opted for the in-ceiling route. I was able to pick these up on sale for $99 per pair. If you can wait, wait for the price to drop, which it frequently does.Installation was easy and mount very flush. The cutout template they provide is very sturdy and makes it easy to trace the hole. Our 2nd story is above the ceiling I mounted them in, so there was no way to see where the joists were. I used a thin knife and make holes ever 90 degrees around the template to make sure that it was clear. The tabs lock securely in place and grill is magnetic and snaps flush with the ceiling.Overall the speaker seems very well made. The binding posts are the push spring type which I love. They hold the wires securely and make installation a breeze. The tweeter can swivel 15 degrees in any direction as well. Not sure how much of a difference it makes acoustically, but it‚Äôs a nice touch.The sound quality was above what I was expecting. The range is broad and full, hitting highs and lows well, and transitioning smoothly. I turned my subwoofer off to see how the bass sounded with Bob Marley and it sounded great.

My previous maker made it 6 years. (Manufactured in 2013 and went out 3 days ago) it probably would have lasted longer but I have very hard water, never filtered it, and never cleaned the maker, NEVER. After taking it apart to see if it could be fixed I had a very good view of what that hard water did to my coffee maker. This time I will be using filtered water and will be cleaning the maker once a month. Now, with all that said, I did read all or most of all the negative reviews and seen where people said‚ÄúThe filter basket will overflow water and coffee grounds‚Äù-‚ÄúThe coffee maker smelled like burning plastic for 2-3 days from initial use‚Äù-‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get the maker to make a strong enough cup of coffee‚Äù-‚ÄúThe coffee temperature is not hot enough after it finishes brewing‚Äù‚ÄúBunn coffee makers use to be great now they‚Äôre junk, don‚Äôt wast your money‚ÄùNow as far as all of the complaints above I‚Äôve experienced none. I like real strong coffee so I fill the filter almost full of coffee(it‚Äôs strong trust me) it doesn‚Äôt overflow on me. It‚Äôs hot enough that if you pour a fresh cup and try and take a big drink you‚Äôre going to scald the inside of your mouth. No burning plastic smell at all. Completely brews a pot of coffee in 3 minutes. Oh yeah, I read where some said you have to fill up the water tank after every pot of coffee brewed or remember to turn off the water tank switch or you‚Äôll burn up the heating element. That‚Äôs completely wrong because once you get enough water in the maker that the water begins to come out into the pot there‚Äôs always water in the tank unless you turn the maker upside down and drain it. I gave this Bunn 5 stars all the way across. My only and last question is how long will it last. If it goes out before 3 years I‚Äôll let you know. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope it helped you out on your decision.",You‚Äôre gonna love these Bunns baby...,"If you‚Äôre like me, and I don‚Äôt suspect many of you are, but if you are, this is the ONLY coffee maker to buy!I am one of those guys who yells at the microwave to hurry up. Even remembering the days of TV dinners that you had to heat in the OVEN. Back when the TV remote was the closest kid to the TV and everyone in the family knew the sweet spot in adjusting the rabbit ears to get good reception.Back to the Bunn. Before there was Mr. Coffee, the sexist misogynistic jackass he is, there was Bunn. Think COMERCIAL coffee maker. In the days where it took fifteen minutes for Mr. Coffee to even show up to the race, Bunn has me four cups in. I say, and take it from me as I‚Äôm a professional coffee drinker, there is no better coffee maker out there unless it produces IV bags and a drip that lets you just mainline your coffee. Until that is invented, Bunn baby.",Clean often!,"Let me start by saying how much I love this machine! Coffee in three minutes‚Ä¶ What is not to love? However, I want to recommend that you clean your machine often! I‚Äôve had this machine since January, use it daily, but decided that maybe it needed a thorough cleaning today. I ran a pot of bleach through it, and this was the result. I have been having some stomach trouble for the last month, checked online and saw that other people have thought that maybe it was their coffee maker. After looking at this pot of brown water, I think maybe they are right.",I found the negative reviews funny after I got mine and used it for awhile,"I did a lot of searching before buying the Bunn and read all the reviews on Amazon. I found the negative reviewsfunny after I got mine and used it for awhile. The first negative was about how noisy it is. I remember as a kid the sound of the old percolator pot telling us the coffee was about ready. I'm a little off track here but I'm comparing the sound of the old coffee maker to the Bunn. The sound is very little louder than the percolator style, I just don'tknow why they would find it disturbing. Some people complained because it didn't have a timer, they should have bought one with a timer if that was a problem. I don't drink coffee throughout the day so I bought a ten dollar timer from Ebay. I know that adds ten dollars to the cost of the Bunn but that wasn't a problem for for me. I bought the cheapest model because apperiance is not important. I understand the inside parts are all the same on all themodels, the outside is cosmetic to please peoples difference in taste. I think there some people that just like tocomplain. Over all I am very, very happy with my Bunn. I use Cain's coffee in it and that is a good combination. JUST MY THOUGHTS",Only coffee pot we'll ever use,"We've owned Bunn coffee makers for 20 years now. This is the third my family has purchased. The replacements are not due to the coffee maker, but our water. Our water is extremely hard and after awhile, even with monthly cleanings, the minerals take their toll on the insides of the maker.I don't need autostart in the morning, or fresh ground coffee every morning. I just want a good, hot cup of coffee. Bunn does the job.",9804,2,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FFRZ26

Thanks for the great little bundle!!",Seems very protective,"I had 18 really important papers that I wanted to keep together in the same place. I also wanted them to be protected so that they would not be easily bent, folded, or otherwise compromised. I took these folders out of the box and removed the yellow one. I opened and closed it a few times to make sure that it would keep the papers safe. I then added 9 papers to each side of the folder to give it a test run. Nothing was wrinkled in the slightest. Each paper looked exactly as it did when I inserted it into its pocket. I was ready for my important papers. After some hesitation, I put them in. Nine on each side as with the practice run. I was going to just put them away for safe keeping, but I peeked once to make sure that nothing got wrinkled. Everything looked wonderful. I got the folder and then was ready to put it away for safe keeping. But I peeked one more time to make sure that nothing was wrinkled after the last closing. Thankfully, nothing was damaged. As I mentioned earlier, these are important papers.I have 5 other folders so I could conceivably store 90 more important papers if the need should arise. I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my choice at this point.

Since I had so much to buy I did not want to spend a lot of money but I did want it to hold up. These folders fit the bill. They are made of sturdy plastic that seems like it will hold up well to use. The metal clasps function well and line up with the holes created by a three holed puncher. I like that it can hold things in place with the clasps and for the stuff that I need access to I can put in the pockets. If I have to get something out once clipped in it is easy to get papers in and out. The folder can fit a lot of pages and the clasp works when pushed to the limit of what it can hold.,"Durable, colors for various classes/necessities","Very strong material and I like the bright colors. It helps keep my sons classes in order and tidy. I imagine these will last for years.

I just got the massage cushion BUT I got it an hour ago and I had it set up and ready to use in less than a minute. I am now sitting down and in ABSOLUTE HEAVEN. I have serious pain in my lower back and hips and MAN! This is such an awesome item!1) It's easy to set up (and I DO MEAN EASY).2) The remote control and it's options are fabulous!

I've taken a picture so yawl could see for yourselves exact what it looks like RIGHT out of the box.You can choose which area of your body you want catered to. You can choose the the INTENSITY of the massage. You can have heat with it. It has a timer that you can set for 15, 30 or 60 minutes. You have six setting that include tapping, kneading, pulsating, rolling and an auto feature (that actually is very cool) AND it's not bull manure either! Each option is DIFFERENT from the next selection. In one case the difference is minor but it IS different.3) IT LOOKS NICE TOO! I thought it would look like hell but it doesn't.

It never made it to her car, because she enjoys it so much at her computer chair.In my opinion, this device takes too long to produce heat. It's comfy, it can vibrate a little and is easy enough to operate. I was expecting the heat to quickly jump into operation, but it takes about 10 minutes to get it even feeling warm in a room at about 70¬∞ F. If you extrapolate, it could take significantly longer to warm up in a cold car.It takes about 5 minutes to feel warm, and about 10 minutes to feel hot. It does reach ~100¬∞ F (checking with laser guided thermometer). It //seems// like it takes even longer with both heat and vibration active.For what it's worth, you'll be hard pressed to find a comparable product that heats AND vibrates, AND can be used via DC car socket or AC adapter. AC adapter is rated 12V@2.5A, in case anyone was wondering. DC connector uses standard 12V DC size (2.1mm x 5.5mm).UPDATE:After learning more about the product, it turns out there are 3 heat modes: OFF, ON HIGH, ON LOW. It is quite difficult to tell at first. Additionally, for what it's worth, I decided to get one for myself. Wife and I both have one, and we're enjoying them (daily so far).",Feel that vibration.,,Best massage & heat cushion!!,"OMG this one is so awesome. The vibration & heat massage work great, and the timer is right on!! I highly recommend their product to buy 100%. Their website was down as far as sending the warranty forward, and I called customer service right away. they told me to send an email to support@snailax.com customer service # is 1-734-709-6982 I'm in Ann Arbor, Minnesota I'm located in Florida and do not work for this company just in case you think I work for them. My photos probably aren't the best, but I definitely wanted show some kind of photos",Everything about it is incredible,"This massage cushion has saved me time after time. I've probably had it for 4 or 5 months now. My office chair that I use to work from home was giving my hip and lower back terrible pain, even with a $40 cushion I bought on Amazon.The massage and heating functionality of THIS cushion is incredible for the price. It has saved my lower back from countless injury (most recently from moving). After a few hours in my chair, a 15 min massage (settings: high intensity - kneading mode) and i'm ready to sit another 3-4 hours no problem.I had hurt my back when on vacation, and this cushion allowed me to still be able to sit for no problem 8 hours a day. I even think it helped the recovery process (no way to know for sure). I used this cushion in my car to pick up my parents from a nearby city about ~1 hour away - and I was super worried the drive would make my back worse, as long trips in my car can cause that. I tried out the car function - and it worked just as great as in my home office. I was actually surprised the vibration was as strong.Disclaimers - my back pain is not from trauma like slipped discs, just muscular, so YMMV depending on your condition. Also, this is not medical advice - i'm not a doctor. Also, I was not paid, given a discount, or asked to write this review.",8382,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MGRDWB5

Many people get hot when they sleep especially with the new foam mattresses. They don't tell you when you buy those mattresses that they will trap heat. I go this for my dog a long haired Shih Tzu. But when I looked at those expensive ""cooling"" mattress topppers and what they were made of it was the same as this mat. So I tried it and now I use it more than the dog!",I am sold!!,"I am sold. These work great indoors and in the shade. FYI, They do not work directly in the sunlight as they absorb heat and become extremely hot.",Glad I ignored other reviews,"When I came across this gel mat I thought it was the right size for my dog but I was reluctant to order it because of the low rating. I read the 3 reviews, first lady was upset it didn't come with instructions!?!! Second lady complained her puppy chewed it. (puppies tend to chew things). Third lady said her dogs had no use for the mat, OK all dogs are different.My older Maltipoo loves it. He sniffed it, then pawed it a little to get it the way he wanted it, then he laid down on it and got cool. I was kind of amazed he was able to do this since the mat did not come with instructions.",Kitty loves this!,"I was pretty worried at first because of the other reviews about this pad getting torn easily. But I've only had it for a few hours and my kitty LOVES it. I plopped him on after I took it out while he was nosing in curiously. He just laid down on it and didn't move for a while. I bought this because it's been a brutal first summer for him, especially since he was born in late autumn. He huddles near the front door of our apartment to get some of the draft under the door when the AC isn't on.I do cut my kitty's nails regularly so I'm hoping it holds up against his nails. He went a little nuts during play time and skidded around on it, and the pad seemed to do fine without any tearing.Also, when I apply pressure to it, it definitely is cooler than the floor and is a soft gelatinous material.If my 11 year old cat likes it too, I'll most likely buy another one for her as well.Attached in the picture is him on it, with a mouse toy for scale. I bought the Medium size one as my younger kitty is about 7lbs and has a small body frame. My older cat is almost 9lbs and of medium build, and I think the Medium size mat will fit them both just fine.","Great product. Does what it says. Lightweight, maintenance free and great price!","I have 2 of these in medium for my Cavalier King Charles who's really bothered by heat, even in Winter. . I leave one in the fridge while he's using the other one. They're very sturdy especially when you consider how lightweight and slim they are. This is the second set I've purchased in 3 years because it seems the gel loses its ability to maintain a cool temperature. I've used several other brands that are more expensive and start to leak after 6 months or so. For what these pads do, the price is terrific and I think 18 months of constant use is a more than reasonable life span. Such a small price to pay to make my pup so happy!",8219,1,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007JT4P88
