So far it’s great. We had an Oyster brand for 7 years. It stopped working so I decided to get another Oyster. It’s a 4 slice and the lever on the left side wouldn’t stay down after about one year. After reading tons of reviews from the most expensive toasters to the really cheap ones, I found that it didn’t matter the price or brand, you were taking a chance on getting a lemon. I bought the Cuisinart 4 slice because it’s the one that I was comparing the Oyster 4 slice to when I bought the Oyster a year ago. Since this Oyster didn’t last as long as my old Oyster I went with the Cuisinart this time. So far I noticed that the coils in the Cuisinart light up a lot better ( more evenly) than the Oyster. I’m no longer getting toast with one side darker than the other and light & dark spots because some of the coils didn’t get hot on the Oyster. The other thing I noticed right away is the Cuisinart’s leavers went down with ease and stayed down. I had to snap the Oyster’s leavers down hard and fast to get them to catch. That’s probably why one leaver on the Oyster stopped catching. The Cuisinart was 3 &1/2 times pricier than the Oyster so Im hopeful it’s a case of you get what you pay for. So far I have no complaints about the Cuisinart. If I was LOOKING for something to complain about on a personal level, it’s so quiet that when it’s done toasting I don’t hear it pop. Also, (this goes for every toaster on the market) it’s hard to toast pop tarts without loosing them down the sides. I’m not a fan of and don’t buy beagles or thick bread. I would pay 10 times more for a toaster that would toast normal slices of bread and pop tarts without the hassle. I will give an update after I’ve had the Cuisinart a while longer.",,1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZ3P6AUN4PRFNDINGDAY4CLJLOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0000A1ZN1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Cuisinart,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18DQF35LQM4WV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000A1ZN1,B0000A1ZN1

I have always owned the basic two slice one setting toaster and never really gave it much thought. Then my husband decided he wanted to update our appliances and talked me into this toaster. I will admit, I was apprehensive. Let’s be honest, it’s a toaster, it just toasts. I was wondering why we would ever spend more than ten dollars on something that just toasts but I relented and the toaster was purchased. It arrived in great packaging and undamaged. I took it out of the box and was instantly in love. The toaster looks so adorably retro and the symmetry of the handles and levers on both sides of the dual toaster is very nice. It is a very sleek stainless steel with black accents. The toaster not only has different number settings for the level of browning you want but it also has four settings; bagel, defrost, reheat, and cancel. Since buying this toaster, I have started purchasing dessert breads (in an amount that I’m too embarrased to mention) and freezing the excess when they are discounted. Whenever I feel the desire to have a sweet treat, I grab the bread out of the freezer and use the reheat setting. I swear to you, it tastes just as good from frozen as it does fresh. Another feature I love about this toaster is that it has separate crumb trays for each side of the toaster. I don’t know why I like that, but the thought that the company went that extra little step is just a nice touch. Overall, though I initially resisted, I absolutely love this toaster. I would recommend it to anyone and would buy it again.

I only use it for plain toast, not bagels or other fancy stuff. But it toasts very uniformly and consistently from one toast to the next. Only caveat: if you are toasting 4 slices at once, it pulls a LOT of juice. In our kitchen we have to run this thing by itself; if we turn on the microwave or coffee maker at the same time, it blows the breaker. That probably says more about the crappy wiring in our kitchen, but just note that this toaster pulls a lot of amps and if you have substandard wiring and your breaker box is on the other side of the house, you might come to hate this thing.

Buy it now,"I bought this two, maybe three years ago, and it is honestly the best hair tool I've ever owned. It works incredibly well, heats up super fast (and has a temperature control so you don't fry your hair), doesn't noticeably damage your hair, it's consistently worked for the last three years, and as far as high quality irons go the price is pretty reasonable. As someone who curls her hair pretty much every day and has gone though a lot of curling irons, this is the best one by far. I also do hair and makeup backstage for my school's plays, and so I've tested this iron on many different types of hair and it's consistently worked on everyone. Other people often bring their irons in, too, and this one works better than all of them, people are constantly coming up to me and asking where I got it and if they can use it. I know people who claim they've never gotten their hair to hold a curl before, and this iron has made their hair curl. It's kind of magical. The only annoying thing about it is the cord can get really tangled up, but that's not a huge deal. Seriously, buy it. You won't regret it. A couple of things to note: I have pretty long hair (about elbow length when wet) so the 1 in barrel works perfectly for me, but I have friends with much shorter hair and it's too big for them, it only flips their hair out and doesn't curl. If you have a bob or short hair, go for a smaller barrel size. I'd recommend not using the clip, too, because you get more natural curls if you don't, but if you do want to use it it does come with extra springs if the spring breaks off, although I've never had to use them.",,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEH7YYLEP4OTIFJXXPIRI4OWVMDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0002L93N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,HOT TOOLS,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13ZIAGTR9FVHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002L93N2,B0002L93N2

My hair is very tough to curl so normally I have to crank up the heat and leave it on my hair for several minutes. I was really impressed with the nice big bouncy curl and volume that the wand produced. It held pretty well too after I sprayed some hairspray onto my hair. There is also a nice long cord and a swivel at the bottom of the wand so that the cord doesn't continually get tangled up. Really fantastic product for the price!

I am loving the Hot Tools iron for the exact flip of all those reasons - my hair now holds a curl for nearly the whole day and the varying temperature settings are perfect. The curling iron is heavy but not in a negative way, more in a high-quality way. I always hated curling my hair because it took so long but this past weekend, I wore my hair in beachy waves for nearly the entire time because I am in love with how this iron curls. If you've never curled your hair before or don't feel confident doing so, watch some tutorials (Youtube) before attempting anything too complicated and definitely do not turn the heat up to the highest setting at first. I bought this in the 1 1/4"" size and am likely going to purchase one in the 2"" size when I have some extra money laying around.

It definitely took practice to get to use well (I burned myself a couple of times), sometimes the curls would fall nicely sometimes not. Overall, I felt the 1"" barrel was too thin for my personal tastes, but I could make it work if I tried and had a lot of time to work with it. I don't hate the iron, and I'm keeping it just in case (it can make some nice looks too!), but I wanted a new iron that fit my needs better. I bought this for myself for my birthday, so I could dress up a little and feel fancier while going clubbing or going to special events. I always wanted to curl my hair but didn't feel a curling iron was worth the investment [normally $50-$60 for a better quality iron] for me personally, as I can't imagine curling my hair often. The price of this one was just so great (a little less than $30), I couldn't help myself. Pros: --1 1/4"" barrel The curls are exactly what I wanted: voluminous and sexy. If you leave the curler in you hair for less time, you can have cute waves, too. Some styling and you just look like you worked so hard. Having all of the sections in 1"" curls was not always flattering on my long (mid-back level), slightly layered hair. It could look a little like a lion's mane haha, if I wasn't careful. Oftentimes I'd pull some back to do a half-up, half-down to make things look better. This 1 1/4"" is just so much more ideal for me. [Maybe check Youtube videos and see what girls use when they curl their hair for examples?] --Clip The clip prevents you from using your hand to wrap around the barrel and is therefore relatively safer imo. I would sometimes not use a glove with the clipless (not recommended), but lightly burned myself once. Still, you have to be careful with either--both are safe as long as the user is safe! The clipless effect does look a little different--The main difference is the slight crease where the clip holds onto the end of your hair--but I don't mind. To me it's a little too much effort with my long hair to deal with the clipless iron. --Heat settings Talking with friends of mine who curl their hair far more often than I, I heard a couple of times that a better quality (read: more expensive) curling iron with heat settings is really worth the investment. And normally higher quality ones have heat settings. According to some previous reviews I chose not to use the highest setting right away. I generally keep this one around the same heat: A mid-level makes nice looser curls on my normal (not too thick) hair. --Aesthetic I love black and gold together, so this just looks so nice to me. The gold is also supposed to be a good material to make a barrel out of! For smoother curls. --Value $30 is not bad for a Hot Tools curling iron. Cons: --Can't think of any yet!

This product is perfect for achieving loose curls that last all day. Evaluation Criteria This product evaluation is based off of the following criteria: 1. Price. This curling iron compares to others that cost less than $100. 2. Heats quickly. Curling irons should be convenient to use and require little time to heat. 3. Produces long lasting curls. A good curling iron should be one that produces long-lasting curls. Overall Assessment I have used my Hot Tools Professional Spring Curling Iron (1’’) for a few weeks now and each time I have use it I been even more pleased with it than the last. I chose to purchase this curling iron after doing some research online and finding many articles had rated this curling iron as the best. At $31.80, this curling iron seemed like a steal since it was ranked better than curling irons triple the price. This curling iron does what it says it will in the product description. It heats up quickly and produces curls that will last all day. There are variable heat settings you can choose from. The directions included with the curling iron recommend three different heat settings depending on whether you have fine, regular, or thick hair. The highest setting is 430 degrees, which is the one I use for my thick hair. It heats to temperature in under five minutes, making it convenient to use during your morning routine. One drawback of this curling iron is that it does not have an automatic shut off timer, but if you are careful about shutting it off and unplugging it after use, then this shouldn’t be a problem. Curling your hair is quick and easy with this curling iron. Within minutes, you can change straight, boring hair into beautiful loose curls with volume. The curls are soft and shiny, not frizzy. They will last all day and sometimes into the next if you use hairspray the day before. For the cost of this product, I feel you get a tremendous value. So far, it seems very durable and like it will last for years.

I have shoulder length hair and normally use a straightener to get my beach waves. After seeing a beauty blogger, whose opinion I have come to trust, post about this on her website, I figured why not give it a try. I like to think of myself as curling iron challenged and can never seem to get it quite right. I always end up with spider legs no matter how many tutorials I watch. For some reason, with this one I didn't. I loved that the cord twists so it wasn't getting all wrapped up around my head and I loved that it's really long. I set it at 400 degrees as some other reviewers suggested and it worked for me. I have semi thick hair and I could probably go a little higher. I used a heat protectant on it and my curls lasted all day. I got the 1 1/4"" barrel and I thought it would be too small when I saw it, but it gave me the messy relaxed beach wave I was going for. The only downside I could see about it was that it wasn't smooth when I was sliding it down my hair. The edges of the clap made it a little difficult but it didn't affect my curl in any way. It was more about the flow of curling it. I tried wrapping my hair around the barrel, but found it was a little too loose for the look I wanted.

Since it would be my first time trying this brand, I decided to go for this slightly more inexpensive, slightly smaller barrel & I couldn't be happier!

I think I could even go to a lower temperature next time to achieve loose waves. This is the perfect iron for me & it will definitely be a great replacement as my go-to curling hair tool.

A social media influencer I follow briefly mentioned this product in one of her videos and said she'd had it for six years, and that it was far better than any other product she had used to achieve the same wavy look. I went ahead and ordered it without much thought because it was so affordable, relative to other products I had seen. It arrived in a day and a half (2 days max?) and I ran straight to plug it in. Without so much as reading any instructions, as it was pretty self-explanatory, I was able to curl my entire head of hair, and without any hairspray or product, they still look like I just put them in six hours later. This is unheard of for me, as my straight hair refuses to hold curl...ever. This was arguably the quickest I've ever been able to curl all of my hair too, and with minimal effort since there's no spinning of the wand or wrapping hair around a barrel.

Transporting it to places like those is not an issue, but I wouldn't try to take this hiking. The hinged door, auto roll windows, and LED lighting system are all very nice features. This is easily best tent I have ever owned. I read plenty of negative reviews of the Coleman CPX power pack and did not want to deal with additional batteries for this thing. I already take my Milwaukee power tools and their batteries along on camping trips, so I wondered if maybe I would be able to use them instead of the CPX system. Turns out, it is possible! The CPX 6 system is rated for 6 volts and 2.6 amps. Milwaukee, DeWalt, Makita, and probably other popular power tool manufacturers all have adapters for their Lithium Ion batteries that provide a USB (5 volt, 2.1 amp) output. Knowing that a 6 volt system would be considered dead around 4.7 volts, it seemed like 5 volts might work. For $1.09 I bought a male USB to female 3.5mm x 1.35mm DC power jack, which plugs right in to the existing tent wiring, and powers the LED system perfectly. Power tool Li-Ion batteries are far superior to the NiMH batteries in the CPX 6 system. Might be the best $1.09 I ever spent.",,43,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG3RQBHYCNMPTQ7KJ7T4ZDJS7VWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001TSCF96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Z9V6HC2SZ58J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TSCF96,B001TSCF96

We used this tent in Garner State park area (Texas). When we arrived there were 15 mph winds with gusts over 30 and minimal trees to block wind. Assembly would have been much easier had the wind not been such a factor. I needed extra hands to help secure while I placed stakes. (Purchase the Coleman Stake kit additionally!) Once the tent was raised and staked with about 10-12 stakes the wind would not affect it. The tent looks amazing and functions equally as amazing. The features such as the hinged door, tool up windows and center LED light were well worth the money. The first evening the wind continued to blow in excess of 20 mph and we had a pretty decent rain added to the mix. We kept all the (3) windows fully opened and although it sounded like the wind was going to take us away... we stayed 100% dry. I was blown away by this tents ability to keep the rain out in those contortions. Granted, a harder downpour might have warranted putting windows up. Overall, this tent is incredible. If I was forced to make a single complaint or suggested to Coleman; I would say mark the rain fly better as it is very confusing how to put it on when you’re fighting the wind.

Took it on our camping trip to ...,"Loved it. Took it on our camping trip to Arkansas, in mid July. Needless to say, it was HOT and humid. Let me get the bad out of the way, as there really wasn't much to complain about. CON- Not a lot of ventilation. That was most noticeable in the hot and sticky weather we camped in. The roof is complety netted, and the sides have about 18"" domed windows, but it just wasnt enough to allow a cross breeze. I highly recommend bringing a fan to offset that issue. Note- the tent has a power cord access hole by the door. What I loved- the space. The tent is very good size. The left and right ends of the tent fit one queen size, double thick, blow up matress on each side PERFECTLY. I slept on one side and 4 children slept on the other (vertically). We had a little over 5 feet of room in the middle, between mattresses. I am 5'8"" and could stand upright very comfortably. Also, kids can reek havoc on a tent zipper so I loved the easy access door. The set up- took me about 30 mins, in the dark, all by myself. I was HOT and irritated, and probably wasn't the best scenario to put the tent up for the first time. I highly recommend staking it down before starting. A standard 2-4 person tent you can get away with not doing so, this one is defiantly not one of those. I cannot speak to how well/easy the tent fly works, as it was too hot to put on. I like how the directions are attached to the inside of the tent bag itself, so you do not have to worry about losing them for the next go around. In all, loved the tent. Poor ventilation would be my only complaint. Relatively easy set up, lots of space and an overall kid friendly design.

I bought this tent in 2012 and after reading several of the bad reviews on it thought I would put in my two cents. Some background- I am an Eagle Scout and have done a lot of camping. If this tent leaks its because you did not put it up properly. every thing should be tight, the rain fly should not touch the tent wall and you should have a tarp on the ground that is slightly larger than the tent with the extra curled under toward the ground so that when water runs off your tent it rolls around the tarp and to the ground. So on to the review. I bought this tent to go camping with some friends in northern Alabama. we were going camping and rock climbing on top of a mountain. while we had check the weather and saw a hurricane developing in the gulf it was supposed to head for Texas so we decided to go and have some fun. the next day we spent all day rock climbing and forgot to check the weather again. that night we noticed a storm rolling in and pulled up the weather . A cat 3 Hurricane was headed right at us. we didn't have time to leave so we prepped the best we could. that night my friends tent was leaking all over the place so they stayed in mine. There was a 12"" river running under the middle of this tent. you didn't need an air mattress it was like sleeping on a waterbed. at some point in the middle of the night a small 6 in tree fell on the tent and it just brushed it off almost like nothing happened. It only broke one pole. If you put this tent up properly it is a beast. and worth the money. All tents are only limited by how good you are at setting them up. Research, Practice, Fail, and try again! Good luck and happy camping!",,15,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFFJJI4ODHTZNCLLMO5WSJWLYMHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001TSCF96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2M4146XDKWMAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TSCF96,B001TSCF96

I used waterproofing spray on the tent (i would highly recommend this for ANY tent) before we left for the trip, and I had no problem at all with leaks. I would never recommend using the tent stakes that come with any tent, I didn’t even open the bag that came with this tent - do yourself a favor and get some heavy duty stakes. I loved being able to stand up, lots of room in this tent. I’ve been camping for 32 years, this is my favorite tent so far and cost about 1/8th of what I paid for my rei tent.

I was thinking of given it 4 stars because it had a little leak during the rain on day 1 while camping. Many persons complain about tent leaking but understand this. Which tent is really truly fully waterproof? They are water resistant up to a point. Get some water repellent spray or solution and you are good to go. After the rain I applied some Dry Guy Waterproofing Spray and voila, no more leaking when it rained again every day for the next 3 days spent camping. Since it was just me and two boys sharing the tent, it is pretty roomy so I can't really comment about accommodating 8 people. I love the extended awning at the entrance way. I can store my shoes outside without worrying about them getting wet in the event of a downpour of rain. Love the fact that I don't have to zip up the door, that swinging door worked like a charm.

Can easily fit 3 queen size air mattresses plus gear. The downside of the tent is that it does require two knowledgeable adults to set up but it is fairly easy to do so. We have used it to camp in Denali National Park (Alaska) in the summer and it holds against the winds very well. If it weren't for the actual movement of the tent we would not have known there was wind outside. Also experienced heavy rains during the night and while our neighbors were flooded out we woke up to a nice dry and cozy tent. The actual rain fly does have condensation that can drip into the interior of the tent but it is one of the downsides of the vent. We have sprayed ours with water repellent to help the water flow down the rain fly faster and not pool at the top. Another downside is if you have a toddler the door is quite difficult for them to step over as it is higher. Not a big deal since you will most likely be assisting with taking off shoes anyway. The cover is AMAZING for keeping shoes dry; would not recommend sitting with camp chair as legs would most likely get soaked.

Several of the others have REI tents. Which always end up wet inside. (So now they set up tarps over them). This tent has NEVER leaked. The only time anything was ever wet, was when a sleeping bag it was pushed up against the side, and the water seeped in that way from touching it. A family of four with air mattresses (2 twins and a queen or 4 twins) can fit comfortably with space for luggage as well. There is a hook on top for hanging a tent light, and two hanging storage pockets (to hold your water bottles and flashlights for easy reach). The unique door flap is great.

We did get rained on twice, but not a drop inside. It is super larger. My daughter slept on one side on a twin air mattress and I slept on the other on a queen air mattress. Definitely enough rooms for mom/dad and 3 young kids...or maybe 3 - 4 friends. There was still a nice area in the middle for clothes, food, and a place we played games while it rained. Because of everything between us it felt like we each had our own bedroom in there. I suggest setting up once before its needed and used. This is also when I sprayed water sealant and gave it time to dry/air out. Partially stake the 4 corners before putting the poles in and trying to erect it. We did fumble a tad on the 1st setup, but for the 2nd, my 8 yr old daughter and I quickly set up and it was getting dark when we started/completely dark by the time the poles started going in. We did it with only flashlights, and it still only took 20 minutes including staking the ropes etc., and remember, with an 8 yr old! It's a bit on the heavy side, but that doesn't matter for campgrounds. My biggest complaint is that there are only 2 pockets on the inside. Also, the unzipping and zipping of the door every time you go in and out gets old fast, but that is true for most tents. I thought I may regret only having 2 windows + door/door window for a breeze, but it was fine and allowed the breeze in. Overall, I'm happy with the tent for my specific needs.

I came across the Coleman Montana 8 Tent, and as I always do before I purchase an item, I read the lowest rated reviews to see what could be potentially wrong with this item. it seemed that the biggest complaint is that the rain fly doesn't keep rain off and that the floor of the tent ripped easily. Other than that, there were great reviews for this tent, notably, that it was roomie on the inside, which was a feature I was really looking for- as I hate being crammed into a little tent and waking up with my sleeping bag feeling damp from the morning dew. Anyway, it was 50% off so i figured, what the heck? so i bought it. I must say I was very impressed. i had read a review that said it could fit 3 queen size air mattresses inside, which was not a lie. The width of the tent is litterally 3 queen size air mattresses long. the middle of the tent is tall as well, both myself at 6'0 and my boyfriend at 6'5 are able to stand up in the middle of the tent. The rain fly is pretty cool, because it gives you coverage when you first walk out of the tent and adds an overall asthetic look to the tent. however, as every seasoned camper knows, you will need to add a tarp over the tent if you happen to get caught camping in heavy rain. This brings me to the floor. The reviews were that the floor can easily rip. Yes it can-just like any other tent's floor can rip if you don't lay a tarp down before you pitch a tent. Every seasoned camper knows to do this. So overall, I have to say I am very pleased with this tent and would defiantly recommend it to anyone.",,24,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFXR3IGIGT4BTBOUWJE53YDULE2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001TSCF96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33OG56K2FHS7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TSCF96,B001TSCF96

We had 2 XL cots, 2 toddler cots and and old style fold up cot with mat. With plenty of space to still move around and get dressed! For a family of 5, it worked great. As the kids get bigger we may need an upgrade, but it will be great for quite awhile! Take down wasn’t too bad, especially since on our trial run we marked the folds with a black permanent marker as we unfolded it. It’s on the bottom, so never seen, but a huge help in putting it all back!!! It was still windy at take down, so it took 2 of us. One to hold and one to fold. Very happy with this tent. In the sunlight it warmed up nicely with the fly on and windows shut. It was easy to wipe down when my son threw up in it, curse our luck! Only suggestion, don’t actually stake it down right away.

The instructions were written well. I did buy some 10"" metal tent stakes to replace the stakes that came with the tent based on other reviews. The temps were in the 90s and I was worried about ventilation because there are small windows in this tent, but the mesh roof seemed to allow adequate ventilation, and we slept fine with our battery operated fans. Our second night we had major thunderstorms. The tent performed exceptionally well under high winds and sideways rain! We did have to close the side windows, but we were able to keep the screen on the door open because the overhang on the rain fly kept rain out. We got 2.5"" of rain in a couple of hours and not a drop inside. I did lay a tarp under the tent and I had water between the tarp and the tent floor, but absolutely no water on the tent floor. We used a queen air mattress and it fit perfectly with room to spare on the sides. When we camp with the kids we will put another queen mattress on the other side and still have room for bags and gear in the center.

I checked out reviews on Amazon and CampMor, and talked to as many camping enthusiast friends as I could. My first year in scouting, I borrowed a Eureka 2-person tent from our local boy scout troop, which came up to (maybe) my waist, and just barely fit my full-sized air mattress. After struggling to change clothing while lying down (I could barely kneel, let alone stand), and suffering through a fairly sleepless/stuffy night in the Eureka tent, I decided that the following features were necessary for comfortable camping: 1. The ability to stand up fully. This meant that any tent I chose had to have a center height of at least 72"", preferably more (my husband is 6 feet tall, and if I ever want him to join us camping, the tent needs to work for him too. The Montana 8 has a center height of 84"" (7 feet). 2. Room for gear and at least two full/queen sized air mattresses. Although the Montana 8 states that there's room for 8 people, the diagram shows these 8 people sleeping in mummy bags very close together. From a comfort perspective, this tent will hold 4-5 people (and their gear) at a maximum, without feeling overly crowded. For the three of us, this fits the bill nicely. 3. Intuitive and easy to set up and take down. While I like camping, I am not an avid camper. Finding a tent that can be set up (and taken down) with only help from a 9 year old was key, and this fits the bill nicely. 4. Good cross-ventilation. After sleeping in a stuffy tent once, I didn't want to repeat the experience. Three windows (the two side windows and the door window) can be rolled down to allow for good air flow and ventilation. We rolled the windows down 1/3 of the way, which provided a very comfortable cross-breeze while sleeping. 5. Waterproof with a bathtub floor. Many of the reviewers stated that they had no problems with leaks along the seams without using any waterproofing sealant. After talking with others and reading some recommendations, I used the Kiwi Camp Dry Heavy Duty Water Repellent to spray the seams prior to our first use, as added protection. We had some light rain during the evening, and much heavier rain the next morning, and the inside of the tent stayed bone dry. 6. Quality. I wanted a tent that would stand up to occasional car camping trips, without having to be replaced on a regular basis. Coleman is a recognized brand, and after talking with folks who own Coleman tents and reading the reviews, I was convinced that this tent would be a good one for our family. So far, I'm pleased! 6. Price. Given that we don't do a lot of camping, I didn't want to spend hundreds on a tent. I purchased the Montana 8 in Blue (not the Elite) from Amazon in mid-May 2015, and paid $136.48; a surprisingly low price for this particular tent model/size. Some nice features that this tent offers (that weren't on my list of must-haves): 1. A port for electrical/extension cords. While this tent does not have electricity, it does include a port near the door that allows campers to run an extension cord into the tent (for use with lanterns, fans, etc.) 2. A covered entry area. I looked at tents that had screened in areas, but opted for this one instead, choosing to have the extra room inside the tent rather than in a screened area. I had two camp chairs outside - in the evening, when it started to rain, I placed the camp chairs under the front rain fly ""awning"", on either side of the door. Despite the rain, the chairs stayed mostly dry, with only a few drops of water on them. 3. A ""D door"". This door has a pole that threads around the D curve, and another one at the hinge axis, which means that the door can function as a real door in terms of opening/closing, rather than a door that must be zipped open and closed. While there are Velcro closures around the D curve, we found that to keep insects from getting in we still had to zip it shut. However, we liked the easy entry! All in all, my family and I are very pleased with our new tent, and look forward to many years of use!",,43,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGFHI7STPJCZWRVZO22PBIZTMXEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001TSCF96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IBAYFFW58VI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TSCF96,B001TSCF96

Our family needed a tent. Our other one was a hand-me-down two personer. We have 2 kids now so it just wasn't cutting it. I am not a camping lover, so I am not looking for a tent that can withstand the elements, so I cannot state how it holds up to rain. But it was CRAZY windy when we used it and the tent did fine. As for the easiness to set up, this tent was a dream. I don't camp, but still was able to put up this tent by myself, with a toddler helping me. The tent only has a few poles to push through. The hardest set up part was actually the frame for the door with was VERY tight so needed to be zipped up before putting the ends where they needed to be. The framed front door made it easier for my toddler to hold open and get in. The size of the tent is dreamy. We have a queen air mattress, a giant dog bed, a baby rock n' play and a toddler mattress and still have room for my son to run from bed to bed. With all the screens, it made withstanding the wind no problem. It just rolled right through. Putting the tent away was a little bit harder. Just trying to figure out how to package everything back up. I think we had the tent put back just fine, but I don't think we got the rain fly back in the bag.

It rained on us off and on for 24 hours. About 10 mph winds. Pretty heavy rainfall led to pools of water all around the OUTSIDE of the tent. Being an avid camper I know that on any polyester tent when it’s raining it doesn’t matter what kind of water proofing the manufacturer boasts that it’s best not to actually touch the tent. Touching the tent with water on the other side enables the water to bleed through much like a glass of ice water does when it creates condensation. I instructed my three kids not to touch the tent any more than they had to while it was pouring rain. We stayed bone dry! We had plenty of room for two small cots, a crib, and air mattress, and games in the center floor. At the price point I’m extremely satisfied with my purchase.

Size: it fits four people well with air mattresses at either end. I can see fitting 6 people in a row lengthwise, but it's hard to see how 8 people could fit unless no one used air mattresses and you were side by side like sardines. Interior space: The center has a good amount of head space, if you put the sleeping bags at either end, it makes a comfortable space. There is a side pocket on either end to store things and a light hook at each end and in the center. The zip opening for an electric cord is handing, although it would be nice to have one on the other side as you either have to orient the tent towards the outlet or have a long extension cord. I really like the structure to the door. Set up and take down: it's easy to put up once you know where everything goes. There were a couple of steps on the instructions that were a little confusing, basically everything connects to the silver rings. Once you understand that, it's easy. The take down only takes about 5 minutes. The hard part is folding it to get back in the case. The first time we used it, I was able to get the tent back into the case, but there is no way the rain fly was going back in. The second time, I couldn't even get the tent in and zipped. There must be a trick to getting all the air out and it flat enough, but I haven't figured it out yet. Weathering the elements: We've used this twice. The first time, it stood up under very windy conditions. The tents of people around us were collapsing, but this little tent held up to the winds. We haven't used it in rain yet. Edited May 2018: We took this out on a trip in some Houston rains and I didn't notice any leaking at all. Packing up, I asked another camper the trick to getting a tent rolled up tight enough to get it back in the case. The trick is the tent poles. Lay down your tent pole bag at the end of the tent and fold the tent in thirds so that the folded tent is no wider than the tent pole bag. Then place your pole bag at the end of the tent and begin to slowly roll up the tent, allowing the weight of the poles to push the air out of the tent. The experienced camper told me it was important to go slow and not force the air out or it could damage the tent. Since the tent is a rectangular dome, there will be more tent in the center, so you have to be sure to keep folding in the extra as you roll up to it. The trick is when you come to the other end. Since it has a tub bottom, all the air will be pushed ballooning up that waterproof (and airproof) area. There will be no place for the air to escape. To get the last bit of air out, roll back the end you've been rolling over the stakes until you come to the end wall window. Next roll up the end you've been trying to reach, which is ballooned up. So the pole end is just unrolled to the window and the opposite end is rolling TO the window, pushing out all the trapped air. Unroll the end with the poles to the opposite end again. If there is still too much air, repeat until the whole thing will roll flat. I had to do this three times, but in the end everything fit. I was able to fit everything back into the case completely with room to spare.",,7,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEPRY45DDNWV7QGB2FNCHH5WFMSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001TSCF96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OFB38JCB9DT9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TSCF96,B001TSCF96

The LED light and switch is also very nice and a convenience I would choose the elite over the regular to have, as are the quick roll windows. So far we have camped in good weather so I can't attest to the tents handling of wind or rain. I have only a few very minor complaints or observations about the tent. First, setting up the tent itself is fairly simple and quick; both times I even managed to do it myself with no assistance though a second person would be helpful. The rainfly however is a tad tedious; it is hard to get on the tent as it is so tall, I'd almost recommend putting it over the tent before raising it. The fly also has about a thousand Velcro straps to tie it down with. Once I located them all the second time I put it up I was much faster but it's still a chore. I would skip the fly if you know the weather will be good. As others have noted the Velcro holding the door shut doesn't always fit well; we mostly use the zipper unless coming back through the door almost immediately. Our other tents all had zippered doors so this isn't a huge deal. It would also be nice if the door had a catch so it would stay open if you wanted to. I also found it inconvenient that there isn't any sort of hook at the top of the tent to hold a fan; my other Coleman tent has a clip to hang a tent fan and the Montana elite just had the light there. Again, a very minor thing but if you camp in hot weather a lot it might be an issue. Over all we are very happy with the Montana elite 8. It has more than enough room without being too bulky or unmanageable. It's straightforward to assemble and seems built to last. I would recommend it to anyone looking to move to a bigger tent that could easily sleep 6 with everyone on there own air mattress with room to spare for gear.",,4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHAS37IAAIBDBIU6WWPW65ZHP5TA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B001TSCF96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R1F2MNAX0FGN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TSCF96,B001TSCF96

This year we needed to replace our previous tent and decided to go with a Coleman tent because of the ease of ordering replacement parts if need be. Originally bought the ""Coleman Red Canyon 8 Person Tent"" and one of the poles broke on the first set-up. Decided to try this tent because we liked the idea of a door. The tent goes up easily if you have ever put a tent up before. The poles seem very sturdy and the tent is spacious enough for 2 full size & 1 twin air mattresses with very little walking space. In my mind, tents are made to sleep in or get out of the rain if need be. This tent has very adequate airflow even with the rain fly on, literally no condensation on the walls through the night. Without the rain fly you have a great view of the sky. The hinged door is a truly nice feature. It is held in place by several large pieces of Velcro attached to the tent and door when you close it and works very well for small children (5, 7, & 8) to get in and out of the tent without help. We camped at Mammoth Cave National Park for 7 nights recently and honestly could not have been more pleased with a tent. It was very hot and muggy during the trip but the air circulation in the tent was nice. We only had one small thunderstorm during the trip and the tent showed no signs o leaking.

It's really nice to be able to stand up straight in the tent and the hinged door is a great bonus. Only negative thing I currently have about the door is that it is a big step to get over the side of the tent to get in. So if you have little kids or mobility issues, it will be a struggle until the kids get bigger. But it wasn't really that big of a deal for us. I have set this up 3 times. Once with another person and Twice on my own. Easily doable on your own. Doesn't take that much more time either. I looked at the elite version for a long time before purchasing this tent. I didn't think the extras were worth the cost. We purchased our own lamp that we hung in the middle of the tent on the hook and it worked just fine.

Looks like I got a new version with the silver letters that don't have the little r logo. I was alarmed to say the least given all the negative reviews about fake products. But having checked Bushnell's site, they have this version on there so not gonna worry much more. Everything checks out for me, and to be honest didn't at first. Definitely they are cutting costs in various ways to keep this price point, but comparing this to a 2013 (gold letter) model I got new (and just returned), it looks like my silver letter modern version is better quality than that, with some minor not so important differences in details. I don't care if it has an etched dot vs a printed one for the setting indicator. I'm not worried if it doesn't have the two holes on the front lens cap Doesn't bother me that the battery cap is slightly shallower on the threads. My lenses are clean; nothing, but what's supposed to be in the inside is there, and the windage and elevation turrets are solid while being easy to use (don't care that it don't say something on the underside of the cover caps- clearly shows an R with an arrow and up with an arrow on the knobs). The setting dial is firm yet smooth to turn. I like how they have the circled B logo behind the setting indicator dot. So far, thing shoots accurately as far as this amateur can tell; will see how durable it is and update. One person mentioned that the older versions were brighter and I found that to be the opposite, which is also worth mentioning: on settings 9-11 (at least for me) it's too bright and has a glare that is annoying, but with shades on I found even setting 3, in really bright sunlight, is plenty bright enough with a crisp dot. I feel lucky because of all the negative comments, mine works well and hopefully will continue to. End of the day, solid budget entry level Red Dot Optic. Edit 3/20: Went to the range today and have learned things. 1.) Do not mount this partially on your handrail, keep it on the receiver 2.) Use blue thread locker to make sure everything is nice and tight/won't loosen after some use. 3.) Removing the sticker on the battery cap is a pain in the butt 4.) After 190 rounds through my firearm with this scope (and once I used blue thread locker), this thing is zeroed and stays zeroed. My buddy, a first time shooter, shot a 1 inch group @ 50 yds with 4 solid center bullseye hits. Needless to say he's a champ! And so is this budget optic.

I considered several open red dots, but for under $50 and all the positive reviews, I mounted this TRS-25 to my rifle. It is small and compact - you can almost close your fingers around the entire unit. Briefly, I feared it was too small, but once on, I realized how quickly I could site with a flat M-4 style stock. Unbelievably, the dot was right on target after mounting. I haven't done any precise shooting, but the first few hundred rounds were accurate and target acquisition was quick.

One of the first things I bought after getting back into target shooting was a cheap scope(I'm more about the Iron Sights), and it was pretty amazing and it was familiar tech to me. Bought this Bushnell just to see what all the red-dot hype was about. After sighting it in with far too many rounds (learning curve) this thing is absolutely spot-on accurate. Being stuck at an indoor range, 40 yards out was a tight group and lots of key holes. Looking forward to 200+ yards at the outdoor range. There is a bit of a downside though, the accuracy is so tight with a red-dot it does take some of the fun out of target shooting. With iron sights there's more of a challenge to shooting, each shot has a little uncertainty to it- more of a skill challenge. A red-dot at 40 yards is kind of like hitting a hole-in-one every swing on the golf course. Reward vs challenge just isn't the same. Though I won't be taking it off my AR any time soon.

I bought this for my Ruger Charger, and it works quite well. My 5 year old daughter is able to consistently hit a 10 inch target at 25 yards. The dot is less bright than my Trijicon MRO, but they are otherwise quite similar. I actually like the blued-type finish on the Bushnell better than the easily-gouged rubbery finish on the Trijicon. The Trijicon appears to be more solid in construction, and I'd be much more comfortable relying on it in an emergency than the Bushnell. However, for a plinker, this is perfect. The red dot is about as crisp as the Trijicon.

I got this for my M&P 15-22 as the price was good and I've had good luck with Bushnell in the past. I didn't want to spend a huge amount of money on a red dot for the 15-22, but I wanted something that would work and last. My friend got a cheap $30 knock off and you can really tell the difference. His brightness nob has very weak detents, so it rotates very loosely compared to the Bushnell. I had ordered the TRS-25 and received it a couple days before picking up my 15-22, so it was ready when I went to the range right after picking up the gun. The red dot only took a couple small adjustments the first time using it, so I was impressed that even after shipping it was pretty close to being on point straight out of the box. After finishing at the range, I realized that the red dot would not fit in the box with the gun to take it home, so I took it off and later put it back on when I got home. A couple weeks later I went to the range again and was surprised that it was still pretty close to being on point. I highly recommend this to people that want a simple red dot that is not going to break the bank. I paid about $70 for this and that is considerably cheaper than what the local gun shops were selling them for. I also had a different friend that was thinking about getting a TRS-25 and after shooting my 15-22 and checking out the TRS-25, he will be getting one soon.",,5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHGTU4FSQQHKGEL7ME5TGJTN72QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00200E0HM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Bushnell,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CJ6DI5Q1Y21M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00200E0HM,B00200E0HM

While waiting I did more internet research and was possibly anticipating buyer's remorse as the gold label seemed to be much more desirable. I understand that the gold is the 1st gen model and was held in high regard while many were not impressed with the white. I received the white as I expected. For what it's worth all the problems I read about w/ the white label must've been resolved because I like what I got. The brightness is intense and quite visible even on white paper. The dot doesn't vanish no matter what extreme angle it's being looked through. The knob has nice crisp turns that feel very positive and not mushy like some I've read about. I'm back to not caring about what stupid color the letters are. This red dot is for my Rossi R92 in 357 mag. The stock sights on that thing shoot unusually high @ ~50 yards and this seemed like a good alternative.

B00200E0HM,"Bushnell Trophy TRS-25 Red Dot Sight Riflescope, 1x20mm, Black",4.5,3114,Jeff Cooper,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"February 13, 2014",United States,Amazing sight for under $100,"I had been looking for a red dot sight to replace the iron sights on my Hi-Point 9mm Carbine Rifle. The iron sights were quite accurate, but I wanted a red dot since they are a little easier on the eyes. After reading lots of reviews, I found that most sights with great reviews were several hundreds of dollars. This was the best reviewed sight I could find for under $100. I was very impressed with the quality. It's more compact than I thought it would be, and sits low to the rail so I needed a 1/2"" riser to use it comfortably (not a problem if your rifle has a raised rail). It uses small watch-style batteries so I ordered some extras to have on hand (since I took off the iron sights). The 11 brightness settings should cover all your needs; I use 1 for an indoor range that's pretty dimly lit and 11 is extremely bright, even enough so for a sunny day. The first time I took the sight out to the range (25 yard indoor range) I had forgotten the manual and I've never sighted in a red dot or scope before. It was only a few inches off when I first installed it, and I was able to sight it in within about 30 minutes. Pros: *Slightly better accuracy than the iron sights, but much faster target acquisition time. *Easy on the eyes and you can shoot with both eyes open and still see the target clearly down range with the dot on it. *Bright crisp dot. As I read in other reviews, don't make it too bright or it will look blurry. May not look right in fluorescent lighting. *Feels solid. It's really compact but also heavy for it's size (better than being made of plastic). *Has a really cool looking yellow/gold tint on the outside of the ""business end"" of the lens. Slight blue tint from viewing end. *Everyone who has tried shooting my carbine with it loves it. Keep in mind that this isn't a scope so there is no magnification. The benefit is that you can use both eyes to aim, but this isn't going to help you get extremely precise accuracy at range. Personally I've been looking at magnifiers to install in conjunction with this sight. This will definitely be my ""go to"" sight for any future purchases.",,3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFAMG5EW3O3QZJIOA2GGWCL2AM2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00200E0HM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Bushnell,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H6YDT87J3JRL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00200E0HM,B00200E0HM

It's simple & affordable to me! I was able to pull it out of the box and get it mounted on my AR easily. I'm not one to read instructions.. LOL , I just don't like to. So I pulled it out of the box. Took the dust covers off the lenses. Most important detail to do before mounting it onto your firearm , is to unscrew the little batter cap cover. The power/light switch has a small screw-able cap. Remove that cap then gently without destroying one of the batter holding prongs take out the battery (battery is a flat style battery you would find in a watch). Once you remove the battery, you'll see a small clear circular cover. Take that out of the batter housing area then replace the battery back into the position it was originally. Screw the battery cap cover back on and you're good to GO! Red dot comes with an Allen Wrench tool that is easy to use for the mounting of your new Red Dot. The base unloosens and tightens with that tool. I was able to do all this in about 5-10 minutes give or take. Looks great on my 458 Rifle. The lighting levels of the Red dot can be enhanced considerably and allows you to get a good sight on target even in low light conditions.

The mount stays tight and the dot stays zero after about 200 rounds of 7.62X39 rifle cartridges. I didn't initially give it 5 stars for two reasons. I can't see the brightest setting against sunlit snow or sand unless I wear sunglasses. Not a deal breaker. The click settings are stiff and not as positive as I'd like. I have to visually check to make sure the dot is on (or off when I put it to sleep). maybe it will improve with use. Also not a deal breaker just a little inconvenient. It seems a robust and reliable sight and I have no reservations recommending it to others. By the way, the lens caps are a little awkward. If you read the instructions you'll find they are meant to be pulled off to the side and left on the sight. If you follow the instructions they are less clumsy and less likely to get lost. Update: After torture testing I've upgraded to 5 stars. This sight is Lock Tited to a rail which is screwed and JB Welded to the gas tube of an SKS rifle. A VERY challenging mounting option. Cold the gas tube has some wiggle, hot the gas tube has considerable wiggle and by hot I mean blister your fingers hot after 50 rounds.

Considering it's a 4 MOA dot, 3 MOA Wolf steel ammo through a well used 60 year old rifle I think this sight is extraordinary for about $65.

Broke every common sense rule by installing these Bushnell TRS-25's on both my AR15 and MKA1919 12ga at the range, with only my backup iron sights if they failed in any way: you know that feeling when everything works right for once, and you feel like you actually got away with something that experience says no one gets away with? Yep, that's me. Crisp, clear lenses. Rock solid dial in that never changed all weekend. Dot was visible in bright sunlight without ever having to ""find it"", and on lower settings there was negligible light corruption - on par with much more expensive red dots. Was worried its small diameter would be too much to overcome but that was mostly a groundless problem. Drawbacks: on high settings, both of them have bad light contamination (red dot light source leaks and turns the whole lens area red tinged). You don't notice in it the bright conditions where you would need max power, but high end ones don't have that problem. 2nd is that it has small lenses which in a combat or home defense situation could leave you spending a precious second realigning your head to get the dot back in your view.",,6,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF6FA6G4CDSKZFVBEBNAT2HTZ4YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00200E0HM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Bushnell,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31UUTYB35TIIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00200E0HM,B00200E0HM

It’s a small unit and it’s weight mirrors it’s smallness. I decided I’d try the bushnell on my .22 and see if it could fill the place of a more expensive item. I’ve had the optic now for a little over two years and have changed the battery 3 times over that period. It’s been through a lot of use and the one thing I keep coming back to is that I can almost drive nails with it. The mount is solid but the fact that it keeps coming in and shooting straight is a major plus. I know quality optics. I have 2 other Aimpoints and one Trijicon as well as a slew of other glass. So, would I mount this on my everyday use AR? To be truthful, I would, except I worry about it’s toughness and I worry about battery consumption, but hey what can you expect for 60.00? No I leave my everyday use for the big boys, and we all know who they are. Now, would I buy a couple of these for my .20 gauge and my .22lr? Hunting use? Absolutely, that realm of hobby is a great place for this optic and it fits well in that realm. Though I’ve not thrower it out of the back of my truck or dragged it across America, it is reasonable tough and genuinely water proof. I do recollect it falling mounted down a set of basement stairs and surviving and I remember setting through a weekend of torrential rain with it frog hunting. Scope and gun soaked.

B00200E0HM,"Bushnell Trophy TRS-25 Red Dot Sight Riflescope, 1x20mm, Black",4.5,3114,Miller Time,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"November 19, 2014",United States,Sig 522 - EXCELLENT Primary Sight for Survival Weapon,"Exactly what I've been looking for! I am EXTREMELY picky about my red dot sights because I want something that is durable, effective, small, and lightweight - this meets all of my criteria and then some. I've owned this sight for all of about a month, but it has performed extremely well thus far. BATTERY LIFE The battery life exceeds that of an EO Tech which as all of you know is 5x the price of the Bushnell unit. The battery life for the Bushnell TRS-25 is 3,000 hours, whereas the EO Tech is only 1,000 hours. That means you can leave your TRS-25 in the ON position for 125 days straight before the battery runs out, hence if you carry 2 spare batteries, you can run this red dot for well over a year straight! The caveat here is that this assumes you leave it on one of the lower settings, but even still that's super amazing. DURABILITY If you'd like to see how durable this unit is , please search YouTube for ""TRS-25 torture test"".There is a guy that mounts this sight to his SKS, shoots several hundred rounds in a row, drops the gun/sight from 5 feet and then proceeds to shoot with it from 100 yards!!!! When dropped the sight put a dent in the wood! and it still held zero! How's that for durability?! WATERPROOF Per Bushnell, this sight is waterproof and can be submerged, however, all caps must be tightened prior to doing so. And I belive that I read it's okay to submerge in water up to 5' deep. FINAL THOUGHTS Great red dot, will buy another for the price. Sounds like some people had issues with theirs, and that made me a little apprehensive at first, but with Amazons return policy and Bushnell's 1 year warranty, I figured I'd give it a shot. If you don't have the funds for an EO Tech or AIM Point, then this is the sight for you. I installed this on my Sig 522, if anything goes wrong I will update this review.",,1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEQA3RP3CPEBD6C3DL4XH2XCFH4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00200E0HM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Bushnell,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3C34IK32E86LA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00200E0HM,B00200E0HM

At 50 yard and maximum intensity the shot group is about 3 to 6 inches. The sight has 11 dot brightness settings. The 1st setting is the lowest intensity and on a white or green background in the middle of a sunny day I could see the red dot but it was very faint. On the 11th setting or highest intensity I could see perfectly in broad day light. Update: I have had the TRS mounted to my gun now for a few months. I took it out and shot about 500 rounds through my gun and it was spot on. I shoot with a bunch a friends at cans and paper.

It's super affordable, easy to attach, easy to adjust, and very clear to see. The brightness setting dial is a bit stiff, but I'd rather it be a little too stiff than loose. There is a bit of ghosting on the glass when you turn the dot up brighter, but honestly the brightest settings on this thing are almost too bright, so you'll likely not have an issue with this. Pros: - The price - huge bang-for-buck value (no pun intended) - Very sturdy - this thing is attached to a Beretta CX4 Storm 9mm Carbine, and isn't having an issue with it. - Plenty bright (and brighter than you'll need) - Easy to attach - Easy to adjust Cons: - Again, there is some ghosting on the glass when you have the dot turned up in brightness, but only at the higher levels, which has so far been unnecessary for me. - The brightness dial is a bit stiffer than I'd like, but again, I'd rather it be that way rather than too loose. Overall, the con's were a stretch and not enough for me to deduct stars. This thing is an amazing starter red dot. 5 stars all day long. P.S.

This is the best one I have gotten yet and I'll likely end up buying another for another one of my guns. Right now I have it mounted at 45 degrees next to my rifle scope on my AR because it's size is super manageable. Easy to operate, no fiddling around by turning screws forever until the dot moves because it moves on every click of the knobs like it should (first one I've had that does). Zero'd the sight in no shots at all, just lined it up with where my scope was zero'd and fired one round to see where it went and sure enough, it went exactly where I aimed. Honestly I can't say enough about this sight. It's sturdy, well built and I would most certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a budget red dot sight because I think this one is at the floor level of what you can pay to get something that just works.

The other con is that I am not a fan of the bikini cover if you are using this for home defense and have to get at it in a hurry. I ordered the butler creek lens covers and they fit pretty well. The front will stay on for the most part, but the back (closest to your eye) you will probably need some epoxy. I used the 30mm butler creeks.

Now, the lowest setting is dimmer & more distinct in low light conditions. The highest setting is so bright, I doubt I'll ever have a reason to go that high. I really liked my TRS-25 AR Optic (on a UTG Super Slim .83"" riser), until I got this Trophy. Both are parallax free, tough built, 3 MOA dot, good battery life, good windage & elevation adjustment. I also liked my Primary Arms MD-FBGII, because of the 2 MOA dot, but it's not parallax free. This new Trophy is my favorite of the three. Some critics will appreciate the fact that the dot remains visible throughout the field of view. The dot is perfectly round (when viewed through my phone camera). I see a different shape with the naked eye but I know it's not a problem with the optic. When I rotate the optic, the starburst does not spin with it. There were no external defects. The box was sealed with two transparent stickers so I could tell it was new. This one has a gray logo, but it seems to be constructed like the ones with the gold-greenish logo. The only thing I don't like is, it looks like they got a little sloppy with the glue on the LED. I'm not bothered by the LED partially obstructing the view but the glob of glue on mine is so big, the LED looks round. Perhaps it'll hold better against shock.

B00200E0HM,"Bushnell Trophy TRS-25 Red Dot Sight Riflescope, 1x20mm, Black",4.5,3114,Espresso Fan,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"March 22, 2020",United States,Warning - The primary Amazon photo is incorrect! Shows the discontinued model,"When you first browse this TRS-25 on Amazon, the main display page shows a photo of the sight with the Bushnell Logo in a small font printed in Yellow/Gold. That is an old image. Do not buy this sight thinking or hoping you will receive once with the Yellow logo version like shown in the original Amazon photo. You will get the newer model with a White/Silver logo... even the one Sold and shipped by Amazon! The primary reason for mentioning this is … if you’ve spent any time reading various internet forums and reviews, or taken the time to peruse all the reviews here in Amazon, it's common to find warnings about TRS-25’s with a white versus the yellow Bushnell logo. Also, do not buy this sight if you are attempting (as some suggest) to play the “Yellow Logo lottery” hoping you will receive one with a yellow logo and not a white one. That lottery trick / suggestion is also quite old. It may have worked back in early 2015 when Bushnell first did the redesign but all the old stock has long since been exhausted. The logo color warnings are not relevant, i.e., ones that state the original yellow/gold Bushnell logo is found on models that are made in Japan and better quality when compared to the newer models with the Bushnell logo in white that are now coming out of China. Some of the negative review complaint examples: Red dot is about half as bright. Red dot is not centered in display Red dot is distorted End lens is Green no long Red/orange So... are the current Chinese models inferior to the Japanese model? Not really. Bushnells production quality guideline standards are strictly enforced regardless of the country of origin. Have there been problems or complaints about receiving units with manufacturing defects? Yes! BUT... there are three good reasons: 1) If you take the time to read ALL the negative reviews you will discover a lot of them are pre-2015 when the units were shipping from Japan. This simply means people were complaining about the same issues with the Japanese as with the current white logo models from China. 2) Items like this are mass produced on a production line in the tens of thousands. Occasionally defects find their way into an item, even products from leading manufacturers made in the US. It doesn’t mean the product is junk. It can simply mean you were unlucky enough to get one with a manufacturing defect. 3) Most factual - at any point in time there are typically 4 or more third party sellers on Amazon selling this very same item. Some of the sellers are selling fake products. You can get ripped off. Your best bet is to only buy products like this when the item says “Sold and Shipped by Amazon” If you buy something Sold and Shipped by Amazon, returns and refunds are easy and painless. If you buy a knockoff from a third party vendoryou have to work with them, not Amazon, and may have to pay return shipping and or restocking fees and if lucky get your money back FACT: The genuine current production models from Bushnell are manufactured in China and ship with the Logo printed in White/Silver paint. The logo has a “slightly” raised finish you can feel. Do yourself a favor and look at all the other photos in the Amazon listing, as well as all the images in the advertisement below the listing. You will see ALL the photos show the Bushnell Logo in white/silver. Its only the top photo in the Amazon listing that is incorrect since it shows the old original yellow/gold version. FAIR WARNING: This Red Dot Sight has been around for a long time and is very is popular. As a result there are plenty of fake knockoffs on both Amazon and eBay. Further confusing the matter, the crooks making the fake knockoffs are smart and are aware of the lottery rumors and the hopes people have on finding “new old stock” with the Yellow/Gold logo. As a result the crooks are making fakes units with the yellow gold logo. Today you can buy fake knockoffs with the yellow/gold logo just like the original Japanese model. Don’t fall for it. Today's genuine TRS-25 made under license by Bushnell have the larger Bushnell in white/silver. (see attached photo) TIP: Check out the YouTube video with the Title: REAL VS FAKE Bushnell TRS-25 Trophy Red Dot Sights In addition to the Real vs Fake video , upon inspection of the lenses... one end should appear to be clear glass and the other lens should have a vivid red/orange tint. Lenses on “some” of the knockoffs have green finish or tint. Its a pretty iridescent green , but fake nonetheless. Also be aware some fakes have the red/orange lens so don't use that for an indicator alone. Shop carefully. Better yet ,only buy if it says Sold and Shipped by Amazon Two suggestions to ease your anxiety and pain: 1) Accept the fact you will be getting the white log Chinese version. Buy the TRS-25 when the price is down. How? If you bother to watch the TRS-25 over an extended period of time you will see the price fluctuates anywhere from $45 to $145 (hint: check the website camelcamelcamel) If you wait and watch the TRS-25 on a regular basis you can get lucky and buy it when the price is closer to the $50 range. 2) Be vigilant. Avoid Amazon third party sellers you are unfamiliar with. Read the sellers storefront reviews. Again, your best bet if you decide to and purchase one of these… verify the one you selected and placed in your cart shows: “Sold and Shipped by Amazon”. Granted it may be a few dollars more that one being offered by a third party seller but you know it will be the genuine article Last, some owners have complained the red dot appears distorted or a blurry. This will happen if you have an astigmatism. It’s a very common eye disorder that can be corrected by Lasik or eyeglasses.

Pitbull,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"August 15, 2016",United States,Amazing and durable red dot!,"I've purchased several red dot sights below $100 and none have been able to withstand the recoil of my AK47. Once they reach the 500 round mark all have failed, even the ones that look cool and say made by veterans. None have survived! This is the ONLY sight under $100 that has survived and maintained its accuracy. I now use it on all my rifle platforms. Let's begin with the mirror finish on the lense that not only provide excellent light but reduce glare. The water proof gaskets inside every knob are made thick and very durable. The windage adjustments are tight enough so that you can use a dime and make your adjustments and never have to worry about the recoil to loosen them up. It uses the CR2032 battery and I personally have had them go much longer than a year before having to replace them. Just don't use cheap batteries, purchase a reputable brand and you will never find yourself in the woods with your red dot dead. After testing this sight on my AK47 and shooting a few thousand rounds, I have never had to make any adjustments to them. They are made extremely well and durable. Not to mention they won't fog up in adverse weather nor will they rust, the coating on these is very good. If you find my review to be of help, please click the ""helpful"" button below.

B00200E0HM,"Bushnell Trophy TRS-25 Red Dot Sight Riflescope, 1x20mm, Black",4.5,3114,frogwild,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"March 06, 2017",United States,What's not to like about this red dot.,"I ""discovered"" this red dot sight 5 more years back when I started to shoot in the local steel competitions. I really am a casual shooter and didn't want to spend a ton of money on one of the big boys so I started to research inexpensive red dots and the best reviews kept coming up for the Bushnell Trophy Red Dot. I figured with all the great reviews where could I go wrong. When I pulled the sight from the box I really liked that it was so small. This way I could add it to my S&W 22A and it really wouldn't change the weight or balance of the gun. Sighting the dot in was a piece of cake, the adjustment knobs are tight and give a positive click when adjusting. You know when you moved it 10 ""clicks"". The On/Off and brightness control are also quite stiff to turn, but it does loosen up a little with use. Lets just say that any of the adjustment knobs are staying where you put them. There is no way to accidentally change any setting on this thing. Once zeroed, this dot never moves. Even after 10000 rounds, this dot has stayed zero and not needed adjustment unless I'm changing the default distance to zero (I usually keep it at 15 yrds). But of course this is a 22 and there really isn't any recoil so it shouldn't move. Let me say that I was so impressed with the sighting ability of this dot I purchased more. In addition to the 22A, I also have one attached to my S&W 15-12, Olympic Arms 9mm sporting carbine, Colt Competition 5.56 and Mossberg 500 12 ga.. That's 5 guns, thousands and thousands of rounds of various caliber and recoil and not one of these TRS-25 red dots has lost zero. They simply stay on target every time. Of course an optical sight is only as good as the optic. I haven't had any of the noted issues with distortion of the dot. Some of my sights have the emitter at the 5 o'clock position and some at the 6. I see no meaningful difference between the two. The dot is crisp and bright indoor or out, bright sun or cloudy day the when set to the proper illumination you will see the dot. The coating on the lense helps to reduce glare and the water proof/fog proof construction keep the view clear in all conditions. Note, on a long gun platform, the dot is quick to acquire and has little parallax issue. On the pistol, unless you practice, quick acquisition is not automatic but then again, I've had this issue with other dots I've placed on my pistols. For bullseye or shooting that doesn't need a fast acquisition, these are ideal but in speed steel, you will need to practice. Overall, this is the best low cost red dot sight out there. For most uses, I would put this sight up against any of the more expensive red dots and feel confident that it would perform.

The lens is supposed to be angled to reflect the laser back towards your eye with the laser already coming at an angle inside the sight. Very easy to laser boar site with it being a green dot at 25 yards. Fits my rifles very well and stays zeroed on larger rounds like an akm with continuous follow up shots. For ""optics ready"" firearms, a riser is not needed, but for firearms with a fixed front sight a riser is required and a UTG mount works great. This is the newer model and it works fine.

Penny for penny it is better than my Vortex and my Eotech. Zeroed at 50 yards in no time at all. Has held zero just fine over a few hundred rounds. Install could have been easier but that's really kind of nit-picking. To those complaining that they don't work -- you do realize that you have to remove the clear plastic shield that keeps the battery from making contact until the scope is ready to be used, right? Yes this isn't in the instructions but seriously, how hard is that to figure out? Could the dot be a little more crisp? Maybe. Could it be a little brighter? Maybe. But when you consider the price, what exactly are you expecting? It is bright enough to see in the bright Arizona sun and the dot is crisp enough to drill headshots at 100 yards without much trouble.

Wanted something inexpensive but reliable and compact. Looked like the TRS-25 might be the answer. And so far, it is. I've had it to the range twice and shot over 200 rounds with it at 25-50 yards. I also bought the UTG Low Profile (1/2"") Riser Mount just in case the red dot still wasn't high enough for easy sighting. But the TRS-25 sits at the perfect height just above the iron sights and I didn't need the riser at all. So here are my likes and dislikes: Likes: Very compact and light (see photos) Easy on-off knob and elevation/windage adjustments Achieved my zero with only 6 shots Has held zero with no additional adjustments Good tight fit on picatinny rail Very affordable price Crisp, very bright red dot. I never needed to adjust higher than #3 (11 is the brightest) on a fairly bright, but overcast day. Uses the most common and inexpensive battery Dislikes (I'm going to have to be very picky to find any): OK, if I have to ...... The large, white Bushnell logo shows up like a bright neon advertisement sign. I think the newer model is the one with the smaller, gold toned logo like is shown on Amazon.

Better than I expected!,"Was a little leary about buying this with all the mixed reviews on the ""new models"". But for 40 bucks...what the heck. Bushnell must have listened to all the bad press, and made changes. First the emitter is in the 5oclock position, the dot was nice and bright (easily visible outside in bright snow on the 11 setting), the dot was visible everywhere in the tube (non of the reported dissappearing dot in certain parts of the tube), the clicks on the windage, elevation & brightness are very very positive. The lettering is gold on he box, but white on the unit. The glass is superb..crystal clear...with out any green that I can detect! Overall you can tell that this is a quality unit, made to last.......Way out classes it price tag. May even buy a second.....If your looking for a quality red dot optic and don't have hundreds to spend this is the one! Update: Don't worry about the white lettering...this is the 3.0 version. The original was the gold, then the hit or miss white, this version is spot on Perfect. Everything the old gold one was. VALUE VALUE Value....I'm buying a two more. Lastly..to those who are not seeing the dot as a perfect circle, oblong, or star burst. You most likely have astigmatism...either un diagnosed (this is a really well known side effect with red dot sights), or with out proper corrective lenses. I have that and when viewed with out my corrective lenses, all the dot sights look distorted. When I put them on, the dot returns to normal.

But, you can get such a cast of colorful characters to agree on quite a few things. Most would agree, that for over 60 years, Bushnell has been an innovative leader in the optics industry. They have consistently high standards and reliable performance backed with excellent customer service and they stand by their products. Well, the Bushnell Trophy Red Dot TRS-25, in my humble opinion, is a fantastic example of Bushnell's quality, reliability, and pride they take in their products. Dollar for dollar, you will not find a more consistent, quality, functional, reliable red dot for any near their price point. So, rest assured, your getting a great product you could have paid considerably more for and still been happy. But, how does it perform? I strapped it to a Beretta ARX-100 5.56 (whose iron sights I don't particularly care for), used a laser bore sight to come close to zero at 100 yards, and sent 3 rounds downrange. The sight was pretty much zeroed for this rifle out of the box, but it only took a few clicks to set the sight dead on...only 3 rounds to zero. Well, that was a very pleasant surprise...seemed too easy. So, I rattled 100 rounds through the rifle at 25, 50, and 100 yards. The little powerhouse stayed on point. Next, I attached it to an old Remington Mohawk 66 .22 and went barreling through the bush to rough up the sight and see if it could take a rough night out. I banged into trees, got snagged by bushes, pounded across several meadows, and my rifle even fell out of it's scabbard...but, like a champ, this Bushnell held to zero and I had no issues or malfunctions. It's now bolted to my light EOTWAWKI rifle, a Kel-Tec SU16C 5.56 (keep your snickering to yourselves Kel-Tec haters ;) ). I put a lot of trust in this sight, it's battery life, durability, and performance...(and subsequently, the Kel-Tec SU16, but that's a discussion for another time). Do yourself a favor...spend the few extra dollars to upgrade from a generic Chinese red dot and snag one of these Bushnell's before they're gone...I personally am going to get a spare.",,12,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AESYIQAD5NIUDBOQWVIDRPNY3UNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00200E0HM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Bushnell,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NW81ERDHLBOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00200E0HM,B00200E0HM

At this point I don't like for her to sit in the boppy pillow without me right next to her. This podster is perfect! She can sit up and see everything while being supported on all sides. She will probably be able to fit in this for 2 more months or more. The bottom can be let loose as she grows which is perfect for her to sit up at a slant.

This is our second child to use this same lounger!!! It is seriously a life saver! We used it with out 3rd child while we lived on a sailboat and with our 4th baby now that we live in a cabin. It is still soft and perfect for baby! My older kiddo slept in this till she was at least 18 months old. Now our little peanut can use it. I will say the velcro has warn out a lot, but surprisingly some how still sticks after all this time and tonnnsss of washings. I've washed the cover and the pillow itself, who-knows how many times. For an infant is truly works better to have a folded small blanket in the 'hole' for their bum. They are just too tiny at first, and I have big babies (9 lbs at birth). But shortly after you won't need to do that, and it's truly not a big deal. I thought that stretchy material in the middle would wear out super fast, but it hasn't. It definitely isn't as nice as it once was, but after 4 kiddos, 2 of which have used this exclusively, and two others jumping and playing on this pillow, I am amazed at how well it has held up. I've never personally had problems with the zipper, like I've seen on some other reviews. Ours has been fine. Like I've said, we LOVE this lounger and it is so perfect for our family!!!

I wanted something that would almost wrap around him as if he were being held. I wanted to be able to lay him down after he ate and not hold him all the time, but if he laid flat, he would scream. I mean, he would scream even up to an hour after he ate. Did I mention I have two older kids and can't hold my infant ALL the time? The angle and the comfort of this pillow combined to give me some much needed relief. He really loves this pillow! His reflux issues are better, but now we use the pillow for a multitude of other reasons. He can't sit on his own yet because he's still only 3 months, but loves to sit in his pillow to see what is going on around him. I love to put him in the bedroom if I'm getting dressed, in the kids's rooms if I'm making beds, in the kitchen if I'm cooking...this pillow is super mobile!

Very useful as a feeding pillow and safe space for baby to hang out. Both my sons overheated easily and would get too hot if I tried to hold or cradle them during bottle feedings. My oldest is autistic and never liked being held, period. If I tried to snuggle with him, even as a newborn, he would arch his back and cry until he was put down. This helped him to still be comfortable and secure while also providing some airflow to his backside to avoid sweating. Something to consider: Please make sure you pay attention to your babies head shape on a regular basis and alter the amount of time spent on this pillow accordingly if a flat spot or other issue presents itself. As long as you are encouraging enough tummy time and not allowing them to lay in one spot for too long, all should be well. Because of our sons hatred of being held, among other issues, we allowed him to stay laying on this pillow more often than we should have. He never slept on it, as that is not recommended or safe, but he spent a lot of his awake time in it. After several months we did note a change in his head shape and worked with his pediatrician to help correct the issue. In hindsight had we made him do more tummy time and moved him more often this could have been avoided all together. Our sons situation wasn't caused by pillow, but rather our actions and excessive reliance on it. Just thought it was worth noting so others can be aware of the consequences of overusing a product such as this one.",,12,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHMMSAUW5Q4UB6NGFKMCLK7TY5MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B003HIXOTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Leachco,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15CVTJLT15LCT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003HIXOTQ,B003HIXOTQ

Especially great for Reflux babies,"I love this pod and so does my daughter. I just wish I had known about it when she was born. She is almost 4 months now so she's towards the end range for usage. We had been struggling to find a comfortable position for her to rest while not in our arms. My daughter has reflux need I say more. We have also found it a great position for her to do tummy time in. Although she's not a great fan of laying on her tum when we do it in the pod she is much happier and can go for longer before having a total melt down. I think this is one ~ position, when on their forearms they are much higher up, so much easier for them to see toys on the ground and your face when you get down with them. Two ~ they can dig their feet into the opposite end of the pod and this looks like it gives them a bit more support than just their arms. I wouldn't leave her on her own in this position though as she could at any point push her self off or roll, but while I am their with her I have found it fantastic for tummy time. For lounging again it's a god send. She will happily sit in it and watch my older son play or look at and grab her toys while I sit in front of her. The green colour is lovely and gender neutral. A washable cover is for me an essential for me. (This is one reason I skipped straight over the Boppy Newborn Lounger). The padding is sufficient to provide good support without being overstuffed.

I'm so glad I did. It heats up really fast and it gets hotter than my other curling irons. I recommend starting at the lowest heat setting and going hotter slowly to see how your hair can handle it. I have blonde highlighted hair and my hair can usually take a lot of heat because it's thick but on this iron I only have to turn it to 25 out of 50 and that is more than enough heat for my hair to retain really nice curls or waves. If I would have started out at 50 right away I would have fried my hair. I once heard the saying - You cook a Pizza at 450.. you don't curl your hair at 450- I think that is totally accurate. Some people go way to high on the temps for their hair type and that's why you read these comments about how they fried their hair the first time they use a new curling iron. Definitely recommend this curling iron though. My husband only ever likes it when I straighten my hair, but now with this curling iron he prefers the loose waves I can create over the straight - which is a nice change. ;)",,16,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHF7ETRGE3RIWWXD7PYW5DAE5KA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0047WYSRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,BaBylissPro,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RS44LJHC5T3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047WYSRI,B0047WYSRI

I was quite impress with how quick it heated up. The boost button didn’t seem to work well or maybe I was just unaware how to operate it. I did a trail run with running the curling iron through my hair to see how hard or soft it grabbed my hair. The the final step was to apply heat. OMG. I was so so so pleasantly please with the evenly distributed heat, how smooth and shining it left my hair after applying heat. I softened the root and only had to run the curling iron once slowly through my hair and boy I tell you my split end totally laying down. I got a one inch barrel and it left my hair with a bouncy with a nice salon look and professional soft curl. I am totally satisfied and absolutely love every feature. The last time I purchased a curling iron was back in the day when it was the gold barrel.

So happy with this curling iron!!!,"If you're in the market for a new curling iron (old school with a clip) look no further! I recently cut a few inches off my hair so my $100+ T3 Body Waver's 1.75 barrel was no longer giving me the loose waves I wanted. I had planned on purchasing a new T3 iron with a smaller barrel, but after reading many reviews on-line I decided to give the BaByliss PRO Nano Titanium Spring Curling Iron a shot. The price alone made me skeptical. I had my doubts this $50 iron could match up to my T3, which doesn't fry the ends of my hair and leaves my hair looking shiney and healthy. I ordered the 1 1/4"" barrel on Amazon and had it in my hands within two days and have to say, this Babyliss blew me away with the first curl of the wand ✨. The curls last in my hair all day and it leaves my hair looking even more healthy and shiney than my T3!!! I typically don't like to put pictures of myself on-line, but had to make an exception here and show the waves this iron creates and the condition it leaves my hair in. I really do have a lot of split ends but this baby seals the cuticle and leaves my hair looking much healthier than it is.

I also start curling in the middle of my hair and curl to my roots, let it sit until I feel the heat come through then start releasing my hair until I get to my ends and roll it back up to my roots.

So, while we haven’t camped in it yet, we did throw it up in the front yard to make sure everything was in good shape. I wanted to put this review out there for anyone who is as curious as I was. Straight off, I’ll address the main concern I had, and that was the amount of light the tent lets in. It’s hard to describe, but it definitely blocks A LOT of light. It’s difficult to see inside the tent with everything zipped up, even in the middle of the day (although we did not do it in direct sunlight). It’s as dark as my baby’s room during the day, and he has two layers of blackout curtains over his window. I’ll share pictures, but they really don’t do it justice. It’s very dark. I approve! The downside of that is the tent is probably going to be warm during the day. It is sprayed with a coating to give it the dark room effect (no bad smell, BTW), and that also acts as insulation. That will be great during cold nights, but maybe not great for baby’s nap time in 90 degree heat. We bought a battery operated fan to push some air through one of the screens without having to have everything opened up during our son’s naps (if he naps at all—we’ll see). One thing I don’t love about the tent is that the zipper on the curved hinged door is a pain to open and close (although the door itself is super cool). The flaps that I suppose are there to keep rain out are sewn in in different directions and it snags on those. Plus the zipper was a tad sticky. I hope beeswax will fix the problem. It wasn’t bad enough to make me not love the tent, though. It is still worth every penny! Looks cool too! The tent is huge and we can comfortably stand up inside. It was very easy to set up. We didn’t even have to look at instructions. One downside to this type of pop up tent is that it’s heavier than a traditional pole tent. Worth it for sure, though. Another thing some people will love, but I don’t, is that there are entrances on both ends of the tent. Because we have three young kids, we want to be between them and the door. We’re planning to put a small padlock on the zipper of the back entrance, that way nobody will easily get in or out on that side. We thought found this exact same tent at Costco for $20 more than Amazon. We actually bought it because we weren’t sure if the Amazon one would come in time. When it did come, we compared the two. There was an obvious size difference (Amazon one was in a much larger box), but the tent dimensions were the same. It was a puzzle to us until we opened it up and figured out that the larger one (this Amazon one) is an instant pop up tent and the smaller one from Costco is a quick set up tent, but is not an instant pop up tent. Mystery solved. That’s really all I can report on so far because we haven’t camped in it yet. But since there were no reviews on it, I wanted to get this up here with some pictures. I’ll update this review after our camping trip coming up!

I want some extra space for my dogs crate which is why I think I’ll buy bigger. Also, I didn’t like that I couldn’t stand up in the middle of the 4 person which made me feel clausterphobic. I know a lot of tents are like this so it’s just my preference. Upon more research I saw the review I had been looking at was talking about the 6 person tent which apparently goes to 6 feet high in the middle which I could have been able to stand up in.

The tent is super fast to erect (30 seconds and it's up, another few minutes to anchor), and slightly less fast to take down. The trick is to leave the zippers open slightly so when you fold it back up the air can escape, and then to roll it up like a burrito. I feel compelled to write a review now because we experienced 36 hours of high winds in Guadalupe National Park, including recorded gusts up to 67 mph. This thing took it and is still standing. Granted, we anchored it very securely to large piles of rocks, as well as to a tree in the same direction as the wind. The flapping noise was immense and the poles were definitely getting pushed out of square though. The tent is actually pretty air tight so we were getting a lot pressurization movement as the wind pushed on the walls. I was worried either the fly or tent itself would rip or the poles would snap but it did not! It kept me awake but it didn't take any damage. A few things to note. The poles that slide out can get gummed up with fine dust. We were in the desert SW and if it got dusty sliding the poles in or out was difficult, but doesn't seem to be permanent. The seams are all taped but we did experience some water intrusion through the floor of the tent during heavy rain. We also did have a hole but I'm not sure that was the sole source of the intrusion. A backpacking stove also melted part of the fabric, but that's our fault. Duct tape fixed it right up. The bag is plenty large for both the tent, the fly, and the tarp for underneath. I wish the interior small items pockets were in all four corners, although the one by the door is handy and gets used all the time. The windows are generous and when all are opened and the sun is shining on the tent the inside is not unbearably hot. It is fantastic being able to stand inside the tent and not have to crouch down to get in the door. We have two twin size air mattresses in this and there's room to move around, sit on the floor, and pile our stuff.

I didn't buy the rain fly for this, and it's been fine with humidity. On one of the trips, there was an unexpected thunderstorm with 20mph winds, which lasted about 6-7 hours. I had no extra rain fly, and had not treated the tent with water repellant beforehand. Water started seeping into the corners of the tent after 4 or 5 hours, which I blotted with towels. But I mostly stayed dry. My family's tents were completely soaked that night. My tent also held up against the winds.

From the midwestern monsoon. I chalk that up to my position and under tarp setup. Water ran under the tent and stayed, so 9 hours of rain just sitting under a tent, its bound to seep in a little. The next morning I adjusted my under tarp to allow for a better outflow. The rain slowed and softened, but still continued. It continued until 4pm. I didnt have any added water inside the tent. I'd say if it only allowed in about 2 cups(measuring cups) of water in after 20 hours of constant rain fall, straight out of the box, that's a hell of a tent.

Plus I had to buy a duffle bag to keep it in because no average human could refit it in the case it came in. Looks like Coleman too was slow brained, but now it's the opposite with this tent. It really did take just a few minutes my first time setting it up. I'm sure my second will be 60 seconds or less. And afterward I was able to fit it in the carrying case, though I wish it were just a little bigger because I needed help squishing the sides together when zipping...like me now at size 14 trying to get into my wedding dress of 30 years ago. I'm so glad I can put the tent up by myself. I use an extra long cot from Walmart and had to set it on the diagonal to fit and even then it's poking the tent fabric a little on the outside. There isn't much room left on either side of the cot's interior. I'll keep this tent, but I wish I bought the tent for six people, even though I often camp alone. I like having space to set a little desk and walk around. I haven't been in rain yet, but I did spray the outside with water repellant. I looked all around at the seams and didn't see the seam irregularities some here complained about. It looks really pro. In the middle of the day I went inside to take a nap on a day that was about 80-85 degrees. It was pretty warm even with all the windows unzipped. The sun was beating down directly overhead, so I'm ordering the rain top even though it doesn't rain much in So CA. I'm thinking and hoping that maybe that rain top will deflect some of the heat from direct sunlight.

I hated it because it was almost like building a little cottage with pulling, pushing, yanking, stretching materials. Especially during summer those pipes were getting like fire after a while under the direct sunlight and burn our hands while constructing our masterpiece(!). Yet at the end it never looked like the ones you see in the brochures. You know, all stretched out perfectly without any wrinkle on it etc., Anyways, then lately my wife and I decided to try tent camping again because we saw this specific tent and read about how easy it was to setup. So, give it a shot! Long behold,WOW!!! They were correct! Why nobody thought this years and years ago and made my life easier while I was younger. It literally took about 60-90 seconds to put it up, including the stretch it with stakes and all. Great Tent!!! Take down was even much faster than that. Probably 30-45 seconds Now, I see at some reviews people talking about internal conditions related to waterproofing, temperature control etc... We are a good weather campers. I check the forecast before I go to camping trip. If there is a tornado warning, heavy rain storm forecast or similar conditions WE DO NOT go camping in a tent, nor we are climbing to Himalayas with sherpas in tow. My only experience that we've had a strong 15-20 mph wind one night with gusts to 25mph and tent stood up very well in that conditions and we were very comfortable inside. To sleep on, we used a self inflating twin airbed which becomes 18 inch high off the ground and my wife and I and our 17 lbs Maltipoo were happy in the tent with lots of rooms for other camping gear too. We have 4 person size and it is plenty of room if you are 1 or 2 people camping in it. For a family of 3, even with a young child I recommend 6 person version of this tent.

It takes a little getting used to the “solid/hinged door”, as it relies on a pole system on the outer rim that zips up in the door. Once figured out, all was good, but it sucks having a second zipper running along the outer edge of the door, as this can get confusing as myself and one other person already mistook it during first use as a regular zipper to open the door. PRO: because of the dark nature of this tent, it seems to be a thicker material and did a good job cutting down wind on a breezy and chilly night. Something not advertised in the ability of this tent. To say that it cut down on the amount of light coming in would be an understatement. There’s nearly no light let in and most of it that does come in comes through a zipper or two that you haven’t fully met up on the doors or windows.

It's lightweight and so much more spacious than I thought it would be. We had a queen and twin airbed in there with room for our bags and accessories. It has two interior pockets that was handy for the flashlights, my book and some earplugs...with room to spare. It also has a hook at the top center for a light, which was super handy. I love all the mesh windows which all zip up at night! It's perfect for 3 people. I know it says 6 person but for it to function for us and leave room for bags and a little walkway between the beds, it fits 3 people very comfortably. If we had a fourth we would have gone with the 8 or 10 person tent. But I like size because it a smaller footprint so it fits into smaller campsites and you can still stand up fully in it. The set up was a breeze!! It has this sort of ""pop up"" center that makes quick work of it and that's why I bought it. I'm too old (and lazy) to be messing with inserting rods and all that jazz. The take down was just as easy...we took a small hand held broom and dust pan...swept the inside of the tent out and then as we collapsed the outside brushed off all the dirt and leaves before folding it all the way in. It's ready to pop up and move in next time. We went ahead and got some cots for next time, to lift the air mattresses up off the ground, so we are not having to get up and down off the floor to change clothes and dress (remember, we're old!) lol and a little 3 foot folding bench for outside the tent door to take shoes on and off easier.

B004E4AVY8,"Coleman Cabin Tent with Instant Setup | Cabin Tent for Camping Sets Up in 60 Seconds, 4-Person",4.5,2778,Arthur Senior,,Verified Purchase,Style: 6-person,B004E4ERHA,https://www.amazon.com/Coleman-2000018016-4-Person-Instant-Cabin/product-reviews/B004E4ERHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_fmt?ie=UTF8&formatType=current_format,5,"January 14, 2019",United States,This Is An Awesome Tent That I Highly Recommend!,"Tents come in many shapes and sizes, each have their positives, and their negatives. Some tents are cheap, while other's, really expensive. The best tent for you, is going to depend on what you need from a tent, and how much money you are willing to spend. Most people who like to camp in the summer time, will probably be satisfied with a tent like this one. While other's who camp in extreme cold temperatures, might be inclined to go with one of those super thermal padded tents. PACKAGING: Coleman loves to double pack these tents. When you receive your package, and open it up, it reveals the Coleman bag as seen in photo 1. If you unzip the Coleman bag, it reveals another box! Once you open up that box, finally, you will be able to pull your tent out of the box to begin deploying. DIMENSIONS: The dimensions of the tent are, 10 feet long, by 9 feet wide, and 6 feet tall. I chose a tent this big because I wanted enough space. However, they always overstate a tents capacity. It may fit up to 6 small children. But in reality, this tent can only house up to 4-adults, and up to 2-adults comfortably. PITCHING: Pitching the tent, is not as quick as the company says, which should be no surprise to no one. If you had 2-people working together, you could perhaps do it in 60-seconds. However, I pitched it all by myself, and it took closer to 2-minutes. When you compare this design to a dome tent however, you will take much longer to set one of those up. All you have to do, is stand the spider column (as I call it) upright, then unfold each leg, until the tent is flat on the ground. Then begin extending each leg of the tent, until the button snaps through the slots. Again, it will be a bit cumbersome for 1-person to do, however, still faster then setting up a dome tent. Once the tent is pitched, and you've stretched all the legs outward, then begin setting up your guidelines. If your tent is on earth, you can use the included stakes they give you, to stake the tent down using the guidelines. Additionally, if you plan to camp on days where it will be raining, you really need to waterproof the tent with the optional rainfly accessory, model 2000010331. The rainfly is nearly impossible to put on, via 1-person, once the tent has been pitched up. I recommend 2-people to install the rainfly. The rainfly secures to the tent via plastic C-clips. And the rainfly comes with its own stakes and guidelines, to secure to the earth. INGRESS: The tent has only 1-entry point, the front door. And unlike most tents, which the door spans the entire front half of the tent, this tent's door, only opens 1/2 of the front opening. I would have liked to have seen the full width being used. There are instant popup tents that are larger in size, that do use full width doors. As typical with all tents, it is double zippered, so you can close and open it from within. WINDOWS: This tent is fully loaded when it comes to windows! There is literally windows on every side of this tent, all of them have 2-zippers per window. Each window has a mesh screen to keep bugs out, and each can be rolled down and secured with the knobs they provide. The reason they didn't use the full width for the door, is because they wanted to put a window next to the door as well. So rest assured, if your camping in the summer time, you are going to get plenty of ventilation. VENTS: Now this is where I can be a bit nit picky when it comes to vent locations. On larger tents, they often put the vents close to the bottom of the tents, usually located in the back, or on the sides of the tent. But they chose to put the vents on the top of the tent on this model. I guess if your camping in the summer time, since heat rises, having them on the top makes sense. But if your camping in the winter time, its only going to let all the heat out. And if your running propane heaters, such as the buddy heater, you really want it to intake air from the bottom of your tent. Also, if you close the vents, there is still no way to make them seal in their closed position, so they will still vent when you don't want them to. The vents also come with zipper meshes, as well as the velcro strap that keeps them open. MATERIAL: The materials that this tent consist of, 150D Polyester, and Taffeta 150D. They use taped seams, inverted welded seams, and use rugged polyguard. I'm not an expert on tents, so I can't tell you the values of these materials, or how they are constructed. What I can tell you, is that no integrated weathertek system is going to completely waterproof the tent without the rainfly accessory. However, for a super light sprinkle, you can get away with it. For the most part, this tent feels like quality to me. A lot of times, companies will cheap out on the zippers, but these ones seem pretty good. The material makeup of the tent seems fairly solid, and the aluminum legs also seem pretty good. The spider column was fairly easy to work with when setting up the tent, so I think it is durable enough as well. Do I think the materials would hold up in winds up to 50MPH or more? No, absolutely not! But who's camping in stormy winds? ACCESSORIES: The tent comes with several accessory points that I like. Outside the tent above the door, there is a loop where you can hang a lantern, mosquito repellent, etc. Inside the tent are two mesh pockets, one close to the door on the side of the tent, and the other on the back half of the tent, on the other side. These mesh pockets can be used to store cell phones, keys, lighters, emergency supplies, pretty much anything you need small pockets for. The tent also comes equipped with a lantern hanger. But if your lantern only has a handle instead of a hook, you will need to use a carabeener to attach to the lantern hanger. EXPERIENCE: Most of you are going to use a tent to go camping. While I would love to go camping personally, I no longer have a vehicle, so I have no access to camping sites. Instead, I am thinking outside the box, and solving a problem I have. I lease my workshop, therefor I do not own the building. When you are leasing, its illegal for the renter to make changes to the building, its up to the person who owns the building to do that. The sheet metal roof of my workshop leaks when it rains. When it snows heavy, snow also falls in from the ridge cap. And since my shop is not insulated, it gets mighty cold in there during the winter time, there is just no way to heat it. NOTE: Absent T land owners are not fun. They don't consider you important, and they refuse to fix problems. But they love to go numerous vacations every year all over the world, with the money they make from your rent payments. Capitalism at work fellas. To solve this issue, I bought this tent, I knew that it would solve two problems for me. First, keep the rain off of my most important machines, and provide heat to keep the freezing cold at bay. Also, I wanted a space where I could do work in warmer temps. As you can see from the pictures, the tent fits the available space I have in the shop quite well. I ran an electrical cord up through the top vent, so that I can have power to run a light, space heater, and a charger. I used a 32-WATT LED worklight as my light source, I just used a small bungee cord wrapped around the light's frame several times, then put both the hooks onto the lantern hanger attachment. While it may be crude, it works, and thats all that counts. I run the space heater on low, its set to 65 degrees F, and it oscillates to move the heat around. When I am not working in the tent, I store my 2-best mowers inside, and a scooter. The mower closest to the camera, I actually bought on Amazon! I use an outdoor wireless thermometer to monitor the temp inside the tent, thats how I dialed in the heater. Also, to protect the tent floor from tearing, as I am moving heavy equipment in and out of it, I chose to line the floor with cardboard, and taped the cardboard together. And since I unfortunately do not have carpet material, I chose to just staple some blankets to the cardboard. If anybody has any knowledge on where I can get carpet to line this square footage on the cheap, please let me know. When the temperature is in the 30's, I am able to maintain 54 degrees F with the heater on low. (750-WATTS) When the temperature is in the 40's, I am able to maintain 60 degrees F. If I through the heater on high, (1500-WATTS) I could easily hit the mark of 65 degrees F while its in the 30's out there. But I don't want to use that much power on my bill, so I chose not to. For those of you who plan to use a propane buddy heater, make sure your vent is open, otherwise you will burn up all your oxygen and become asphyxiated. A propane heater generally puts out more BTU's of heating power, but at a price of consuming propane. CONCLUSION: I am known to do things in unique ways, and this tent is no exception. While this tent is a very simple solution to a larger problem, it is both cost effective, ingenuitive, and it just works for me. Nobody can wait on absent t owners to handle things. And there was no way I was going to spend 1000 dollars of my own money to insulate the workshop and fix the roof leaks. I really love my tent, it works really well, and I think you will love it too, if you choose to buy it. Despite a few of my nit picks, I am going to give this a solid 5 out of 5 stars!",,9,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEWOF7BVIKVMARHWEHQWYB3QEZBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004E4AVY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31O6FB6DNI165/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004E4AVY8,B004E4AVY8

Very impressed.,"Honestly I wasn't expecting the quality of this tent, especially after hours of research, seeing 6 person tents in the 300-400 dollar range. The only con I can find with it, is it's size and weight. Due to the robust attached pole system (the trade-off of having an ""instant tent""). Maybe it could be pitched in 60 seconds with a couple helpers, but to carefully unpack and put it up took me about 10 minutes alone. The build quality is impressive. Thick walls and thicker floor tub. Zippers are neatly covered, the roof vents velcro into place and have ample coverage overlap from the mesh. I love the side pocket and lantern hook from the ceiling, it feels sturdy. I don't plan to test it's waterproofness until I generously seal the seams with quality sealer (I plan to use Gear Aid seam grip and kiwi spray). I waited till the last minute to order before my trip this weekend. I brought a properly sized tarp which I plan to lay over and guy-line out if rain turns up in the forecast. Breaking it down was a lot harder than putting it up, as it takes some elbow grease to get this monster back in it's carrying case, but it was manageable. The most notable factor though was I left the windows all zipped up, and I literally could not break the tent down until I unzipped the entire door... the air was trapped inside. This tells me the tent will hold heat from a buddy heater pretty well, and keep the wind out.

It rained on the first camping trip and completely dry inside. I DID NOT buy the optional rain fly. I bought this tent because it has a solid roof and does not need a rain fly. Almost ALL tents have a mesh roof unless you buy a canvas tent. I want a solid roof for winter camping to prevent cold breezes from coming in through the roof. The tent is heavy and awkward since the poles are all built-in and not removeable. But the system works very well. Just make sure you have it staked to the ground before you erect it if there is any breeze. I am able to get it back into the storage case which I consider a major victory.

However, some close friends and camping partner family own this tent. Here is what we did: Step 1- Order the tent Step 2- Order TENT SEAM SEALER Step 3- Order Rain Fly (no brainer people) Step 4- When tent arrives excitedly open box, and set up in the living room (optional, and be sure to check with your spouse first as this did not go over well with mine) Step 5- Take down tent from living room and set up again outside....Use the seam sealer around ALL seams inside and outside the tent liberally (or follow directions on sealant product) Step 6- Put rainfly on tent Step 7- Connect garden hose and prepare leaf blower for weather simulation testing. Step 8- After waiting desired time for sealant to set, simulate various types of rain storms from gentle drizzle to driving hurricane force rain (do this at your own risk and be sure to roll up windows on your spouses car when aiming simulated rain in that direction) Step 9- Now using your leaf blower blast your tent with simulated wind levels from gentle meadow breezes to Hurricane Level 4 winds if you have a 4 speed leaf combo snow blower (again, do this at your own risk) Step 10- Stake down your tent THEN redo step 9, then apologize to your spouse for crushing her flowers. During all the simulated test I found that the tent is NOT made for 50+ psi garden house spray down at full forces.... However, there was minimal leaking, and I think that was from spraying right at the zipper. When using in a true rain fashion there was no leaking after a 10 minute soaking.

It went up so fast, and it was almost accidental...just by handling the poles, it almost set itself up. If it took a full minute, it didn't take a second more than that, and I wasn't even trying to see how quickly I could do it. Because the tent doesn't come with a rain fly, I also got a 12x14 tarp to go with it, and I hung that over the tent when I set it up today. With guy lines holding the tarp nice and snug and draped down over the tent, it looks like I will be able to keep the windows halfway down in a rainstorm and still be fine. That's a lot better coverage than the official Coleman rain fly for this tent. I wish it had a floor vent, but with four huge windows and a ceiling vent, I think it should be more than fine. I have a standard issue U.S. Army cot that will fit inside with plenty of room left over (I'm using this tent to solo camp). Do yourself a favor and buy some good quality tent stakes. My tent didn't come with any stakes (and I'm not sure if it was supposed to), but I've read a ton of reviews that said the Coleman stakes are garbage, so I ordered some good metal official issue Army tent stakes. If I end up bending those, I must be talented. The tent is very roomy inside, and I love being able to stand upright in it - that was one reason I chose this model. It's called a six-person tent, but don't kid yourself. Six people would have to really, really, really like each other to squeeze into this tent. I do think it could fit four without their gear, or fewer with some gear. Two people would love this tent and have plenty of room. Since I'm camping solo, it's like a small house for me. Recommended?

Will fit four average adults well enough, but more so 2 average adults and two children comfortably. Quick and easy to put up and take down. Upon initial inspection, the seems are solid and the fabric is without defects. No discrepancies with the one I received. Zipper function, quality and mosquito nettings were surprisingly on-par with more expensive tents I've had in the past. Plenty of ventilation, though if you purchase the rain fly with this tent, note that it does not cover your side walls, so be mindful during pours how low you unzip your windows. Moisture is more likely to build up in tents on the inner walls more so than water breaching during rain fall, even without treatments. So to avoid puddles - Always vent and adjust your openings as needed if you notice build up in condensation. **Advice for the beginner** - Most tents have a urethane coating and a durable water repellent (DWR) coating much like this Coleman. These coatings do wear off and when they do; are unnoticeable. Coatings of course wear while in use, but also while in storage, so with that said - I implore anyone looking to get this tent or any other tent for that matter, whether it's $50-$800, to shore up the waterproofness of your shelter before each use everytime. 1) Seal the seams: Applying seam sealer can help keep moisture from seeping through. 2) Refresh the urethane coating: The urethane coatings on the INSIDE of your rainfly and the floor of your tent are the primary barriers against moisture. 3) Refresh the DWR: A durable water repellent (DWR) coating helps your rainfly and outer tent walls shed water.

I’m in my thirties and a single mother of two small ones, and I was able to set it up all by myself in less then 30 minutes. I was a little nervous since I did not do a trial run of setting it up before our camping trip nor did I even open the package until we were at our campsite. But luckily this tent is not complicated. To be honest if you’ve ever set up a 2 man or 4 man basic tent, this should be a no brainer just by looking at the lengths of the poles, and there are only three. Granted having another adult probably would have sped up the process however it is very possible to set it up with just one person. Also, I am only 5’3” so you shorties can do it too! I just highly recommend buying a heavy duty tarp to place under to create reinforcement for the bottom of the tent since it’s not thick and I can foresee it tearing easily if a rock is directly under it. And as other reviewers have mentioned depending on the weather of where you will be camping, the always open back “window” may be an issue. I would suggest buying a cheap tarp or if you don’t care about looks then a large trash bag and clip it under the top cover to “close it”.",,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGAUJ5KCEGIVOXDU52TCHKSIGDLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004E4AW1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L0MQO5JD1543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004E4AW1K,B004E4AW1K

I don't do pay sites, and I don't do RV camping. I do straight up real, primitive camping, in the mountains. About rain getting through to the screened-in porch area, yes that's unfortunate. Just look at the weather beforehand, or if you're in an area like Yellowstone that can hail, rain, snow, and have burning sun in a matter of 15 mins, just tie tarps above it. Not a problem guys. Seriously. Real campers don't whine, we simply get creative. Plus, I always put tarps underneath my tents. Anyways, the ventilation is SOOOO good that it doesn't cause any condensation. Condensation is when it's cold outside (Maybe 40 degrees or below while inside your body heat warms up the tent, creating condensation on the INSIDE WALLS, exactly like a cold glass of water on a warm day creates condensation on the OUTSIDE WALLS of the glass (which is like the INSIDE WALLS of the tent, the warm side)). I had some tents without good ventilation where I had to use like half a roll of GOOD quality Bounty paper towel to clean up the nasty condensation EVERY MORNING when the temperature was cold outside during the night. When it's like high 50s F outside at night (i.e. if you just camp in your back yard, or low elevation areas), condensation doesn't form inside because the temperature difference is not enough to cause condensation to form. In other words, on warm nights (or low altitudes like your backyard), the outside air isn't cold enough to cause the inside air with high humidity (or specifically the water molecules in the air) to lose their energy to the outside (as energy/heat transfers from a higher energy/heat area (inside) to the lower energy area (outside)), and thus higher energy ""gaseous"" water molecules in the air inside the tent loses their energy and then forms liquid water, on the sides of the cold tent walls. It's not because the rain came through guys... seriously, stop whining at the tent makers. It's called C O N D E N S A T I O N. Look it up. Thermodynamics 101 guys/girls. If you paid attention to basic Chemistry and Physics courses in high school, you'd know this. But most of you failed! ANYWAYS, the ventilation is so good (basically the entire back side is opened, with just a thin tent wall between you and the freezing air), that on cold nights, you will literally freeze to death, especially if you sleep your heads immediately underneath that back area. Good luck with the migraines. So how I solved this was I simply cut up two clear plastic trash bags (but you can use white, black etc.), and tied them up together at the edges to make it ""longer length wise"", and then OUTSIDE the tent, I tied the two ends above the poles as high as possible. Tape didn't work with these clear plastic trash bags (although tape works great on black trash bags), so I got creative and poked a little hole near the corner of the trash bag corner tip, tied the corner of the trash bag around the tent pole, and then into the hole, knotted it, and got it to stay on that way. See pictures. By using this quick makeshift method, I basically prevented a big opening on the sides and bottom of the back end of the tent, thus preventing the cold air from freezing me and my family to death. The only real con I didn't like were the two holes on either corner where the tent and the screened-in porch attaches. I'm sure they did this to drain out water for those people who position the tent in such a way where the ground is not horizontal and water pools inside the tent. These holes unfortunately are so big that it allows nasty big spiders in, so I took pictures with a various objects to give you a general idea. I simply plugged them with toilet paper... Again, if you use a tarp above, or position your tent so the higher ground is on the back side with the opening on the lower ground, and/or use tarps above tied to trees etc., water pooling shouldn't be a problem.

Stayed dry and cozy!,"I purchased this tent after quite a bit of research, and found some really good reviews and the price was great for the features and quality. Our first trip out was a five day/four night camping trip, and it rained every day and night except the last one. We were the only tent on the campground that was dry inside! The screened-in porch was wet, but not an issue, the bathtub floor kept that water out of the internal tent and even with the windows open, we didn't get any rain or condensation inside. When temperatures dropped into the 40s, we closed the windows and stayed pretty warm and again, no condensation! I did not waterproof or seam seal anything, just straight out of the box! So, we were very impressed! The porch was a great feature for dirty shoes, and other items that you wouldn't want in the tent or to sit outside. It was also a great buffer zone to keep the inside dry and relatively clean throughout the trip. It is a pretty quick and easy setup, it may be difficult to set up by only one person, I needed help to set the cross poles over the main tent area, other than setting those poles, I set the rest up by myself with no issues. We only had two of us sleeping in the tent, there was plenty of room for two cots and all our gear. It would also easily hold a queen blow up mattress and gear. If you are looking to sleep six, you will likely not have much room for gear or anything other than sleeping bags. The porch would fit a small camp table and folding chairs.

Six people could logistically fit but I think four people would be the max if you plan to spend any time in the tent besides sleeping. Set up was really easy, which is nice since we ended up having to set up in the dark. What impressed us the most was how the tent handled the rain...there was not a drop of water inside (that we or the dogs didn't track in). We used another rain tarp over the screened in porch and that allowed us to use the screened-in porch as a place to stash all our wet rain jackets and hiking books. The screened in area floor has a mesh drain so it still got wet with the rain tarp but was easy to drain when we were packing up. We also used a ground tarp inside (instead of outside) and it made packing up really easy and mess free.

We store our items under the cots for quick access and this tent works really great for this setup. Unfortunately the floor of this tent is the worst I have ever seen. We use a footprint under the tent and lay a king size quilt on the floor inside before putting down our cots to protect the floor, but we still get multiple holes and weak spots after every trip. We patch the holes onsite before packing up the tent for our next trip but there are lot of patches after 6 months of use. This weekend we went camping and it rained the entire trip, which we were okay with but the floor began to leak around all the previously repaired areas within a few hours and the vestibule became a lake. We had to use a microfiber towel every few hours to remove the inches of water that collected in the vestibule and anything we stored up there got soaked.

It does catch a lot of dirt/sand from getting into the main sleeping area and you can kick off your shoes in there, but let's be honest...the sand is going to wind up in the main room anyway. I've only every used this tent camping at the Kern River in the spring/summer, so I can't speak about much weather. Of course it gets warm sitting in the sun, but I'm happy that there are so many screens on this and I haven't had any bugs come in (although you can see them under the rain fly at night if you have a light on.)

Got it on Wednesday. I and my 10 year old step son set it up in about 10 minutes, including staking out and rain fly. We experienced some of the hardest rain I have ever experienced while in a tent. We got something like 2 1/2 inches in a few hours the second night of our trip and the wind really kicked up. It was kind of like a mini-hurricane an that second night. Completely dry the entire three day and night trip. The one area that will get wet, especially if wind is blowing while it is raining is the screened room on the front of the the tent. However, a small non-sharp stick or pole can easily slide under the flooring and you can lift it which will make most of any collected water run right out. The rain fly doesn't reach to the bottom of the walls but the pole for the rain fly keeps it sticking out far enough that rain would almost have to be blowing vertically to enter the tent. We left both windows open the entire time the tent was set up and no rain got in because of the design of the rain fly. Definitely not a 4 season tent in colder climates because the back wall of the tent is, indeed, mesh from about half way up the back wall to the top. Excellent air flow for warmer times of the year but it would be hard to stay warm in if the temps were cooler outside. Having the screen room on the front also makes a second barrier to insects. Open the screen room, step in, close the screen room, then open the main door into the tent. Doing this should help keep bugs out very well. Also, we left the actual door to the tent open giving us even more airflow down lower where we were sleeping, instead of waiting for a breeze to waft through the windows about 2 feet above our heads. All in all I am very satisfied with my first trip in this tent. Time will tell how well this tent will stand up to use, but bear in mind it is overall a fairly cheap tent that is not intended for long term use or serious abuse.

Having camped sleeping while hanging in trees or on cliff sides utilizing only bug netting for comfort this was new to me. We fit two twin air mattresses, one full size air mattress, all of our personnel items and still had plenty of room inside. The screened porch provided a great place for all footwear keeping dirt out of the tent providing for an additional barrier for insects and room to ""sit down and play"" quoting my seven and eight year old daughters. The screened porch was a favorite feature of both my daughters and my wife. The screened porches usefulness was in my opinion due to its flooring. Assembly and disassembly were simple and accomplished with ease. I had read complaints about how this tent would not fit back into the bag it came in and ignored them for the most part. It's important to remember that speed is never associated with a large tent. I had more room in the bag after I had stowed the tent than when it had first been opened.

I used to camp regularly as a college student but my husband had never gone and so neither had our five year old son, so I wanted to make sure we were comfortable. This Coleman Evanston tent was perfect. I put it up fairly easily with minimal help from my husband in 20 minutes or so, having pitched only standard, small dome style tents in the past when I was camping solo. Breakdown was simple and quick. We didn't get to use the porch as a porch yet because there was a huge thunderstorm right after we put the tent up... the good news is that the tent withstood the storm no problem, and the porch was a fabulous ""mud room"" for our wet and dirty stuff, keeping our sleeping area dry and clean. I did purchase more heavy duty tent stakes than the ones that came with the tent, and also a good tent footprint for underneath. The only wetness that got in from a really heavy rainstorm (with the tent in an open field) I think blew under the rainfly and came in through the window mesh. It was just a few drops and I'm sure if I'd secured the rainfly better it could have been avoided (the rain wasn't even forecasted, I just threw the rainfly on to help keep the morning sun out when we woke up). Other friends camping with us did not have such good luck with their tents in the storm. This tent was perfect for our family of three to have ample space and keep our packs and toys for my son in the tent with us. You could comfortably sleep four and of course squeeze in the 6 they say it sleeps if you are all packed in like sardines.

So far we've only given it a trial run in our back yard, but I am really impressed by how easy it is to set up, and the design touches are great. For instance, there's a mesh inset in the screen room floor, presumably to allow any moisture to escape that might come in through the front screen. The raised 'doorway' between the screened room and the main room, which a few reviewers have complained about, is intended to work in a similar way, by keeping any moisture out of the main sleeping area. Yes, you have to step over it, but I think it's worth it to know the tent will stay dryer. There was a nice breeze coming through when we had it set up, so I feel confident the ventilation will be good. We decided to upgrade to this tent now that we are going to start camping with our toddler, both for the additional room, and to have a space for play and putting shoes, etc. We were not sure whether to get the 6 or 8 person tent, but I'm glad we went with the 6. It's quite spacious, and we don't really notice the slightly lower overhead height. A bigger tent would probably feel like overkill for us. This one barely fit in our tiny back yard when we set it up! A number of reviewers complained about quality issues in construction, such as the use of covered sleeves for the tent poles, rather than using clips all the way across. I get this, but the tent seems well-made, and if you're just going to be doing basic car camping (like we are), it should serve your purposes well. You could get a really technical, over-engineered tent from another company, but you'd pay several times as much with not much greater return.

Pack up was fine too , everything fit b/c this time we also read the instructions.... btw- it didn't rain, but If it's screened then water will get in the outer 'patio area' however the tent ppl made the drain holes on the front strip.... we liked the tent. We setup chairs inside the 'patio', had a beer and watched the fireflies and listened tom the river and creek...No bugs inside. Cons- Fabric seemed lightweight (hope that's bc its 'Space age and also heavy duty'), the front'door'/entries are zippered and this could use a 'swing door' (made that up...but i hope you'll know what i mean' if you don't ...sorry.)

The setup was quick and easy-- I generally don't like those auto pop-up fast-pitch tents (fast-pitch tents don't strike me as being durable; whereas, if you need to repair traditional tent poles, you can easily purchase a repair kit online). Besides, this tent only came with 4 poles (two for the main body, one for the vestibule, and one for the rainfly)... so no degree in rocket science required for successful assembly. The vestibule is a really nice touch. It's nice having a protected area for shoes and other basics... and I'd imagine the kids might want to set their sleeping bags up there to enjoy the view (and some separation).

It also kind of hard to get the water out, so if you know it will rain, I would recommend maybe putting an additional tarp over it. - We put a tarp down and put the tent on top of it for additional rain protection, so I would recommend that as well. - It's pretty massive, we had two queen size air mattresses and all of our bags and still had plenty of space.

We did not have any major issues with this tent during our camping trips. Good items to note: - Getting the tent installed is super easy, but I highly recommend reading the instructions at least once and installing the tent in your backyard before your first camping trip. It took about 15 to 20 minutes to get everything installed during our first camping trip and about 20 minutes to put everything away. Take time to fold the tent properly or you won't be able to fit all of the items inside the storage bag. - The tent was able to keep all of the annoying and nasty bugs outside and good ventilation inside the tent at night. - I was able to stand straight up in the main sleeping area which was convenient and I didn't expect this. - The screen area will not be dry during rain, but this should not be a surprise from the design of the tent, but it will hold three portable chairs as an escape from annoying flies and mosquitoes. Several concerns: - Two bottom corners in the screen area were not sealed properly and I am not sure if this is by design or the two areas that I noticed were ripped during installation. This was a concern because I didn't want any ants inside the tent, but we didn't have any problems during our camping trips. - I highly recommend purchasing heavy duty ten spikes and don't allow your teenager daughter to hammer the smaller spikes that come with the tent unless you are willing to dedicate one hour of your time making them straight again. :-) Overall, I am happy with the tent and it will last us for several years and I will update this review after our third and fourth camping trips.",,17,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEOTIOW2LY2KXQO4XOACJYU6TL2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004E4AW1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37E3SF15HT0BZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004E4AW1K,B004E4AW1K

The only downfall I have run into twice now is when there is heavy rain. Inside the tent, no problems at all. Stays very dry with the rain cover on top of the tent. The screened room though can collect water because the screen stands out a little further than the rain cover. There is a ""drain"" type of cut at the door of the screen room for water to drain out through, but water can still collect if your tent is not at the best angle for camping in the rain.

We went on a 4 day trip in the woods right along a river. On day 2, it POURED rain for 24 hours straight. Complete downpour. It never leaked inside the main living area outside of a very small amount of rain we found by the corners (I mean maybe 1/2 cup total over the entire day). The screened in area was completely destroyed with mud. The campsite flooded caused all that water and mud to go right through the screen and from that moment on, we couldn't keep the inside of the tent clean. We probably could have if we had brought a nice door mat to wipe off feet and paws but the inside ended up getting covered in sand and mud. I definitely recommend this tent. It withstood a great deal of abuse from that storm and two large dogs and two adults. It was very spacious for us. It started to get a little cramped when we had to spend all day in there while it was raining but it's spacious for normal use. With the top off you can get a really great breeze going through the tent which feels amazing if you just want to lay down and relax without being indoors. This is an excellent peice for an excellent tent. I can't attest to cold weather camping as we haven't used it for cold weather camping but I wouldn't suggest it below 30°F. It's not made of a material that would keep any heat in. You might be able to keep some wind out if you had every part of the tent secure but unless you're packed with good warm clothing and sleeping bags, the tent is not made to keep you warm.

Also, you'll need to tie the opposite-side rain-fly guy line to pull it away from the tent. This could be to a tree though and makes a reasonable clothes line for a few items. Minor negative items: - the ""porch"" area collects water during rain as it's not well covered by the rain cover. It drains at the front only. You must setup this tent with the front door down-hill to ensure drainage. This isn't a big deal but does slightly limit your options if you want the front to face other tents or the picnic table. - it's really heavy, largely due to size. You can't have everything here, if you want ""glamping"" size you have to carry it. This is fine for car-camping or short hike-in camp-sites but don't expect to carry this thing real far.",,3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG32U6MEC7NCCWGNXJ7MTJQA7SNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004E4AW1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFFK71213WK7H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004E4AW1K,B004E4AW1K

Covid 19 happened and it never happened. My brand new Colman 8 person tent was sitting up in our closet collecting dust. Fast forward to August 27th 2020. Hurricane Laura tore through Southern Louisiana. We have been fortunate to not have too much damage. Our power is out however and will be out for weeks. Sooooo. We are camping in our back yard :). The tent is great! Roomy. Big enough for our queen air mattress with headboard. Also the tent breaths really well. Even with this hot humid heat, we can relax inside with the widows open. We have to rainfly up due to the fact in the mornings the humidity is high and there is due everywhere. Also Louisiana thunderstorms are extremely unpredictable. It rained once sense we set it up and i have to say. None of our things inside the tent got a drop on them. However if your have things on the porch they will get wet. One minor glitch however. (And its strictly on me for not preparing the area properly) but make sure to lay down a blanket and/or tarp before setting up your tent. I looked over the spot before I set up the tent for roots and twigs and stuff. The area seemed clear. However after the third night camping out, I noticed a small root wearing away the material where we walk in the tent. Its not a bad hole, but it'll definitely need patching later. All in all. We love this tent. It's a great place to have when you have to rough it after a hurricane ripped through your neighborhood. Turned our unfortunate disaster into an adventure for the family. :)",,2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGEPZNTCY5LBO55KIEO2R5RD3CRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B004E4AW1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19P26E231MDWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004E4AW1K,B004E4AW1K

I think she has even gotten better with age! The folks with major complaints seem to have gotten unfortunately defective shipments because this toaster is amazing. ORIGINAL: I wanted to get a simple toaster after I deciding that I was wasting too much energy to heat my oven up for a bagel. I saw this Cuisinart and liked that it was compact, white (finding a white toaster in a store is evidently really difficult!) had settings for bagels and frozen items, and a darkness dial. I have used this toaster with frozen and room temperature bagels and bread, and I love it! I generally only keep it set to about 2.5 on the darkness scale because I only like my breads slightly toasted. But it gets the job done quickly and easily. I imagine if you put it on the darkest setting you would probably be eating dust. I originally used the cord storage underneath the toaster every time I used it to put it away in a pantry, but then I started using it so much more often and just decided to leave it on the counter since it doesn't take up too much space. The other thing I will note is that it does make a burning plastic type of smell for the first few uses. Just turn on a fan or crack a window if it bothers you, but it does go away and there is nothing wrong with the toaster.

That worked and I had my last no-name toaster for 10 years until one of the spring mechanisms would not stay down. After getting a cheap Sunbeam from Target that I hated, I decided to shop Amazon. This toaster had good reviews, and the pricing was a really good deal. I gave it a try and returned the Target toaster the next day. At last, I have found my dream toaster. The settings give consistent toast color and dryness, and the defrost setting lets you toast frozen bread in one cycle. I have also used it for baguette, and it did a great job.

This toaster is beautifully designed with a professional appearance. It has the power to toast your bread as dark as you want. I keep my setting on number 3 and it still gets dark.

I'm not sure what that does though because when you look inside the machine while its toasting it doesn't look any different. I tried the bagel setting with those new Thomas Maple French Toast bagels. (So freaking good) The outside was toasty but the inside was soft. Maybe that's the beauty of the bagel setting. I bought this because it was white, but I am now a fan of Cuisinart. Thanks Amazon and thanks Cuisinart for making such a great product. Update: Some people say it toasts the bread too dark.

Both cost over $200 each. The first one was from the famous German Company. It burned out in a year and was slow to toast. Then I bought another brand with CLAD in it's name for over $200. It burned out it's toasting elements even faster then the first toaster. Of course there are no household toasters made anywhere other then Cxxxx in the entire world. (There is one company putting together household toasters in England but with Cxxxxxx parts. I read the reviews for American made Commercial Toasters. They cost $400 to $1200 each. It appears they were designed for 220 volt power and the ones made for household 120 volts toast the bread slowly. They are the same toasters except for the heating elements. Apparently the toast is too far away for fast toasting when equipped with 120 volt elements. I wrote toaster companies pleading with their executives to build an American made household toaster and got nowhere with that idea. I finally decided to buy an inexpensive toaster that I could afford to throw away when the element burned out. So I purchased this toaster. It's a 2 slice toaster and yes the cabinet is inexpensive plastic. (I purchased a black one rather then a white one figuring a white one would turn yellow with heat over time. (I did not want to experience that wonderful experience.) At any rate this toaster looks good for it's inexpensive price and it remarkably toasts bread quickly which was a pleasant surprise. The toaster does have a couple extra toasting features and does bagels, toast and English muffins nicely. I've only had the toaster for a couple weeks but for now, all is well. If it does burn out in a year, at least it did not cost me over $200. (I'll never be a sucker to ever do that again.) One last note, don't damage this toaster or any other brand of toaster. On all of them, when you push down the bread for toasting a small switch closes energizing a solenoid plunger which catches under a shelf, thus holding down the piece of bread. When it is finished toasting, the switch opens and the solenoid bar retracts allowing the toast to pop up. If you want to pop up the toast early, push the pop up button so the plunger will release. IF YOU INSTEAD PULL UP THE PUSH DOWN LEVER, YOU WILL DAMAGE THE RELEASE MECHANISM. ALWAYS POP UP THE TOAST WITH THE POP UP BUTTON. That also reminds me this toaster allows you to pull up the lever even higher then where it sits once popped up. This allows you to take the toast out of the toaster without poking down in it to get ahold of the bread for extraction. This is a very nice feature. No more do you need tongs to get the bread out of the toaster or burn your fingers trying to do so. I definitely would buy this toaster again. I've had this toaster now for a couple months. So far so good. It toasts quickly and evenly. Sure, beats my prior $200 each toasters.",,6,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGAFYUBNMBOP5VIRJTNQ4A5U2BRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B009GQ032E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Cuisinart,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24AQL9XAVCYKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009GQ032E,B009GQ032E

Does the job.,"After 12 years it was time to buy a new, simple two slice toaster. I never imagined the drama when I actually started looking online and looking at reviews. Apparently it's just impossible for anybody to agree on a toaster they like. I had two criteria. I wanted white and two slice. Hard to find a white toaster these days...who knew. this toaster seemed perfect. The reviews actually caused me anxiety about ordering this. Like this was the toaster from hell. I ordered it anyway. And I love it. So here is the thing, you have to read the directions. It tells you it doesn't do one slice at a time particularly well. And sometimes they are right. They want you to toast two slices. If you do, it's perfect. Mostly I use it for English muffins and frozen waffles. Do what they tell you to do, and press the defrost button when you are toasting frozen things. It looks absolutely lovely in my white and pale gray kitchen. It toasts what I need it to toast, without drama.

Since this toaster is not only reasonably priced, as well as consistently well-rated from tester sites for appliances, I decided to take a chance on it. It is exactly what I’m looking for: a straightforward toaster with all the basic toaster functions (toast, bagel, defrost, reheat), and in a price range that makes sense for a small appliance that does one thing—toast bread. Additionally, it’s small, has an easily accessible crumb tray, is quiet, and the sides remain cool when toasting. But the best feature is how FAST it toasts! I find it takes a minute, maybe a little more or less, depending the setting. Its toast levels (1 - 5) give pretty distinct toast results from each level, and it toasts fairly evenly, if the pieces fit entirely into the slots—which are not long, but are just big enough to hold a bagel slice. The settings aren’t as effective as I’d like, however; for example, I find the “Frozen” setting isn’t all that different from the “Toast” setting, since toasting frozen waffles using both settings yielded similar results. The “Bagel” setting also tends to toast both sides, but maybe it’s due to the fact I like to use the higher, level 4 setting. In all, I find the positives outweigh the negatives, although I suppose it depends upon what you’re looking for.

Every toaster I have have ever purchased (cheap or expensive) make good toast in the beginning and then they get tired after a couple of years. So I read the reviews, both on the web and on Amazon. I was actually willing to purchase a commercial toaster just to get some longevity. I chose this toaster because frankly it rated number 1 on the web and it had a great price point. When I received it I promptly tested it with an english muffin and guess what, it toasted. Of course I knew that would happen. What I liked was I how could easily inspect the progress while it was browning my muffin. When I thought it was close I pushed the cancel button and the muffin popped up exactly how I like it. Who knew? It was evenly toasted and now I had a reference point for future darkness settings. It has a nice footprint and actually fits inside my toaster cabinet perfectly which is something I've had difficulty with in the past. It looks nice, it's not expensive and it makes toast.

CR2032 battery in. After fooling around with the reticle and Red/OFF/Green/OFF knobs, I eventually figured out how to turn it on, then how to select from red/green and the reticle (4 choices). I initially figured I'd give it about a 3/5 because the reticle was (I thought) fuzzy. All I saw was a fuzzy blob, that would be good only to identify center-of-target. I figured it wasn't worth sending back, for $20. I played around with it some more, then took off my reading glasses, which I need for close-up work. My distance vision is 20:15, so says my Doc'. But close up, I need to use 1.0 to 1.5 diopter readers. I mounted it to the top rail on my AR-15 and thought I'd see how well it was sighted in before going to the range. Turned on the red dot and KNOCK MY HAT IN THE CREEK! It was in perfect focus. Looking through the sight down the top rail, focused on infinity with my dominant right eye, the reticle was in perfect focus. Red is plenty bright. Green is, too, but could be brighter. In full sun, either color is perfectly useable, especially at this price. I haven't shot with it yet, but I don't expect any problems. If there are any that develop after shooting for a day or two, I'll modify my rating. But for now, it's a solid 5 stars. This sight is a no-brainer. You can pay more, and maybe I eventually will.

This optic. Is pretty decent. I’m going to start with the pros. Its easy to install, and easy to make adjustments. Green and red options come with varying brightness so thats cool. And it stays on zero*. Now the cons. The brightness can and will be over powered by the sun rendering it useless outdoors. It can lose zero*. Ok. So i mentioned zero in both pros and cons. I shoot hot 556 rounds without a muzzle device so there is a noticeable difference in terms of felt recoil in comparison to one with a muzzle device. This optic is the shit indoors. And not outdoors. Slow shooting and this thing is as precise as you want it to be. Shooting outdoors rapidly and this optic loses zero faster than toilet paper disappearing last march. You will literally see the dot drift to one side. So if you see yourself only shooting slow to moderate speeds then this optic is absolutely for you.

Paying less than $25 I figured that this would be a junk sight but I just didn't have the budget for a high-end optic at the time. Well I mounted it to the pistol (easy install with an allen wrench) and took it to the range. Right out of the box it was very close to zero and required little adjustment. I sighted it in at 25m and was shooting quarter-sized groups with 10 rounds! (bench rest). I put 50 rounds through the pistol and the sight maintained zero with no issues. I'm VERY happy with it.

However, it looks right, and I'm sure I'll get around to changing it to a lower picatinny on my AR. My point is that even mounting my sight this far from the barrel, horizontally, there is enough MOA adjustment to overlap my, circle sight with a green dot in the center, to my cartridge sighting laser.

I would definitely say it's well worth the money especially for a range/target gun for my daughter. It came well packaged and feels as if it's of pretty solid quality. It even includes a dust cover for the red dot itself My opinion, if you need a good red dot for cheap, this is the one to get.

I spent hours going through reviews and pictures on all these different wavers trying to get one i wouldnt hate and i think i made the right choice. I love that you can change the setting like flip the knob on the end and change the debth of the wave. When its all level i think it makes my hair look more kinked than waved but you can change that setting to get the desired wave. I also appriciate the heat control. It heats up very very quickly and it hurts alot if you bump yourself with it so, like, dont do that. But i use it on my daughters hair sometimes and i dont like to used a lot of heat as shes still little little so i bump it down to almost the lowest setting and it does fine. It doesnt last as long on her, but when i use products and a high setting, it lasts on my hair. Idk how many days as I wash my hair every day, but theres been a few times ive gone to sleep in it and woke up the next day with waves still. I do have to touch up my hair the next morning because they dont stay all night but i do have very fine straight hair that doesnt really like to hold curls. Someone eith thicker coarser hair would probably be able to hold theirs in longer. Ive had this for... i dunno, probably like 6 months now and its still doing awesome. It is kind of heavy and ive definitely burned myself way more than i ever had with my straitner or curling iron but hey, its a learning curve.

B00ID8H838,Bed Head A-Wave-We-Go Adjustable Hair Waver for Multiple Waves,4.4,1477,Lindsey,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"February 19, 2020",United States,Finally a wave that never fails!,Okay where to start. I have short hair and LOVE wavy hair long or short. Few things. Love the ability to adjust tightness of wave. Note to self: middle bare extended to fullest = wider waves. Middle bar lowered to match level of adjacent rods = tight close waves ending up in a super fro for us short haired folk. ( lesson learned ) MUST KNOWS: DO NOT USE THIS WITHOUT A HEAT SPRAY TO PROTECT PRIOR TO USING EEEVVVVEEERRR . YOU WILL COOK YOUR HAIR AND SMELL LIKE AN ASHTRAY FOR DAYSSSS!. I have thick color treated hair that is healthy I only use this at the 375 to 400 setting and HOLD ONLY FOR 5-6 SECONDS. PERIOD. If you want the ends to be the part that flips out than start at base of scull and crimp on down with the purple side of wand touching head. I personally think when I flipped it and did bars down towards head ( yes it's hotter ) I got more of a volume wave beginning at root and a curve in at bottom. Once done spray with flexible hairspray and tada! Waves for days! Con: Although it is meant to be a bit bulky in design to get achieved results there is not a good way to set it down. I wish it came with a stand of some sort or was a bit flatter on the purple size so that when you set it down on the counter you didn't have to scramble for it like you were playing with fire when it falls over.

Even for a novice like myself.,"I rated 5 on presentation but it’s been so long since i bought it i can’t remember. I think it looks like packaging that you would see it in in a store like Ulta or Walmart. Anyways the product itself i LOVE. And like i said it’s been a while since i got it and it has lasted me quite a while without any signs of slowing down. It took me a little bit to get to know this product and figure out how to use it properly. Because when i started using it my parents said i looked like the 80’s spat me out, but now i look like a beach babe with my waves. My hairdresser even complimented how i can make my hair look with this tool. (cuz i suck at doing my hair if you couldn’t already tell.) if you’ve made it this far i’ll give you a tip i wish i knew (if you’re like me and don’t know squat about hair styling): point the waver downwards. it sounds obvious, but i was doing it just straight across and yeah.... no. point it a little downwards away from your face and you got the waves my friend. this especially counts at the top by the roots. but that’s just what i’ve found personally, obviously do what works for you. but i think we can all agree on how great it is to be able to adjust the size of the waves! go big or small or in between! and not every wave has to be the same so you really can look natural with this! adjusting the sizes couldn’t be easier. Last thing is i love how it shuts off automatically. i think you should always UNPLUG the hair tools even if they have this feature- but at least you get a little peace of mind in case you forget as we all do from time to time.",,6,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEOUPI3TBGE2PFCWE64R66G5BANQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00ID8H838/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Bed Head,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK99TUZYTE8DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ID8H838,B00ID8H838

Im sure if you put hairspray or something the waves will stay tighter longer (I didn't use any) but the waver is very easy to use / requires no skill at all. It isn't heavy which I was happy to find because my arms get tired quick , so the fact that it's pretty light is a plus :) It doesn't take forever to heat up and the variety in heat level/wave definition is much appreciated.

B00ID8H838,Bed Head A-Wave-We-Go Adjustable Hair Waver for Multiple Waves,4.4,1477,Nina,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"November 02, 2017",United States,"My favorite, my lifesaver, my 🦄 hair tool! Hair stays cute & Shakira-esque for DAYS","Absolutely LOVE 💜 this Bed Head crimper! I know there’s still a small amount of a strange stigma around using a crimper “wave” heated-hair tool. I think some people automatically think 80s/90s crazy crimped teased wild hair or depending on age, it’s come-back in the 2000s. BUT, this tool is most definitely NOT that! It doesn’t give that tight wave that is the “crimp” but more of a relaxed wave in comparison. It it still going to give more than a beachy-wave for sure but what i also like it the sizing of the wave is adjustable. I will admit that it may seem more adjustable than it truly is; you twist the round black knob at the tip and it either pushes the middle piece of the plate on the tool inwards (smaller waves) or outwards (larger waves). To be honest adjusting the knob doesn’t make a huge difference: what really makes the difference of how you use it! If you want smaller, more waves closer together, when you have your piece of hair, starting from the scalp, when you’re working your way down, simply place the plate closer to where your last spot that you held it on was. And vice versa, if you want the largest wave possible, which is what I like, set the knob so it sticks out the most it can, and again, always starting at scalp, grab a piece of hair that is approx 1”-2” max in “width” (you don’t want it to be a strand of hair like you’d grab to curl, more like when you’re straightening your hair, you don’t want a thick piece of hair) and place it with your hair spread evenly in between the two hot plates, starting as close to the scalp as possible but of course be very careful to not burn your hands fingers scalp etc etc etc!!!!! Clamp down on the strand and hold for a few seconds. The tool does have heat setting options which is awesome! We all know to avoid major hair damage we need to use the lowest possible heat setting that works for our hair type. I happen to have have hair that unfortunately needs high heat or 5 minutes after I do my hair it falls completely flat. The highest setting is what I use but be warned is it extremely hot! Not as hot as some professional heat tools I’ve used but still very hot. After holding the iron clamped together for a few seconds you unclamp, and I suggest lightly (because your hairs hot) holding the clump of hairs you’re working on, loosely towards the end of the hairs, that way as you’re moving down down the strands, when you unclamp, the hairs won’t fall in and be mixed in with your other, non-wavey hairs. Where you choose to place the plates on the second time and so on as you move down the scalp, will produce either more loose waves or tighter more crimp-esque waves; to get the most loose, most “soft” waves, place the end of the plate so that it starts on the last area the plate touched on the first clamp. You’ll keep doing so, moving down the strands working from scalp to tip. I will post pictures. Best parts of this tool is that it’s a great tool where you don’t need to be perfect because it looks great no matter where you place the plates really! It’s meant to look natural and wavy and wild Shakira-like! And also it stays for DAYS! I personally only wash my hair approximately 2x a week. I’ll wash my hair on Sunday night, let it air dry, use a light, doesn’t leave any tho of residue type of heat protectant in the morning Monday, use the waver tool and with a small amount of dry shampoo worked in, and my hair will last 3-4 days depending on my workout schedule lol. I’m able to sleep, wake up, brush it, dry shampoo if needed, tousle tousle and flip my head around and it looks great on days 2,3 & 4. Another great way to use this is also a half up do, loose ponytail, loose side bun, loose braids of any type or a top knot/bun. It my hairstyle 🦄 tool! My favorite styling tool: my lifesaver, 🦄 tool!

Barrels facing my head and barrels facing the ceiling. I really like that you can change how tight the waves are and you can do this while the tool is hot. I held it clamped for about 8 seconds before going further down my hair section each time. It’s also not a terribly heavy device which is nice because some wagers are quite large and heavy and awkward. I do believe this to be a new favorite. A bit of a warning, do NOT trust that just pushing the on/off button again to turn the tool off is turning it off because that’s how I melted my hair brush and burnt my thumb.

I was worried this wouldn’t work and honestly the first time I used it I was not impressed and thought I was going to send it back. But I decided to give it a few more times and I’m so glad I did. After the 3rd time I got the hang of it on my shorter hair and now I have a fast and great way to quickly do my hair that’s not in the normal straight style. I use it on setting 4 for a more “tousled” look.

This is better than i expected! It works quick and leaves a very pretty wave. it is easy to see where to place the iron as you are working your way down and it doesn't leave an ""odd"" looking end either. It leaves a much better result than i anticipated. It really is fantastic. The only downside is holding the iron tight is sort of tiring on the hand after a bit. If she had really long hair i would maybe get tired of that but it is very manageable and reasonable for the price. I would highly recommend! One tip is when you are starting near the scalp turn the iron the opposite direction...like upside down so the first curl isnt so prominent( looks kind of bad). then after the first wave flip it back over. Looks great that way. enjoy.

B00ID8H838,Bed Head A-Wave-We-Go Adjustable Hair Waver for Multiple Waves,4.4,1477,ForeverYOUNG,TOP 500 REVIEWER,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"March 26, 2019",United States,wave hair iron,"Wow. This wave iron is amazing. Let's get to it. I could have included pics, but honestly, there are a lot of examples of that already. I have fairly thick hair, with medium course texture - natural dark blonde, about shoulder length. The handle is a combo of purple metal and black plastic. The on and off switch and the temp guides are inside the pinch of the handle. VERY, very smart. I don't how many times I've used my regular curling iron and turned it off over and over again because the switches are placed exactly where you hold the iron - even on my flattening iron. So bonus on the well placed switches. There is a twist knob on the other end of the iron that allows you basically change the dimension/pattern of your wave... they can be more uniform, or more wild depending on the middle wave iron. There are three barrels as you can see in the diagram. The cord is long and convenient with the most important ""swivel."" It has 6 heat settings 250 degrees up to 400 degrees. Now, let's talk heat - it gets HOT. I would recommend using the lowest heat and testing one step at a time to find the level that doesn't fry your hair - especially if you have color treated or chemically processed hair. Lower heat, for just few seconds at the very most is all it takes. I have a pretty full head of hair and I was done in about 15 minutes. The other thing to note about the heat part is that the iron works on a ""pinch"" system as you would guess.. there are 2 barrels that are completely open and branding hot. So BE CAREFUL! I accidentally burned my left thumb pretty good - happens so fast! I purchased the ""suggested"" hot glove - I now use it every single time I use this iron. And be careful when you get close to your skin, around your face. Having fully covered the safety suggestions, I will say that the waves I did lasted 4 days (I wanted to see how far I could go) and probably would have lasted longer with NO other products in my hair. The finer strands around my face needed a slight touch up, but the rest totally stayed wavy! It was sort of like getting a wave perm or something. I was amazed. I don't get greasy looking hair, but you could use a dry shampoo to extend wear to a day or two easily. The wave ""action"" gives you body and fullness - like a crimper iron - but so much softer. I have ""sold"" so many of these in the last few days - so many people asking if I'd had a perm... what salon did my hair... and when I told them about the wave iron, where can I get one?? I've purchased sooo many hair ""tools"" in my life... but this is honestly one of my favs. Just remember to use extreme caution when it gets hot with the open barrels .. and use lowest temps - going up one step at time to find the perfect temp for your hair type. Don't leave on one spot too long and you'll be amazed at the result and then the staying power of the do! Having said all those things, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. I will be ordering another one for travel soon. Would be out of this world if they included a heat proof sleeve!",,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFZUK3MTBIBEDQOPAK3OATUOUKLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00ID8H838/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Bed Head,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P3XMZ99K7NO3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ID8H838,B00ID8H838

To preface, I have very fine, relatively thick hair, and VERY straight hair. My hair REFUSES to hold a curl. I have tried all kinds of different products and irons to try to get my hair to stay curly, but most irons won’t even curl my hair on the hottest setting, and forget about getting large, loose curls. Any barrel larger than an inch leaves my hair almost straighter than it started. I purchased this waver because the price was right, but I was shocked by how well the waves held up! I used the middle settings of the iron to wave my hair for a protest march. I didn’t have any hairspray, so I just sprayed in some dry shampoo and hoped for the best. The first picture is what my hair looked like before the march, and the second picture is what it looked like after I marched straight uphill for almost an hour! I was sweating a LOT by the time the march was over, but even the bottom layer of hair that was touching my sweaty neck stayed curly, even without any hairspray! This waver is workout-approved. It took me a while to figure out how to use it, particularly because there is no heat guard on the bottom of the iron. Since my hair is short and thick, I split it into three layers and adjust the size of the wave based on how short the layer is. It takes me about 20 - 30 minutes, but considering that using the one curling wand that actually works on my hair takes me 45 minutes - 1 hour to use, that is much improved.

My hair is so naturally straight its extremely hard to do anything with, especially getting curls or those beach waves I so desperately want. WHEN I TELL Y'ALL THIS IS THE GREATEST INVENTION?? Its so easy, it takes me 10 minutes tops to do... And even if my hair was medium or long length, I think it would still take that long. Thats just how awesome this thing is.

I haven't found any products I really ""love"" on my natural hair, so I've just accepted it being huge and out of control all the time. Then I started watching Sex and the City and began to strive for Carrie Bradshaw season 1 curls. They were so, so similar to my hair natural but 10x better. After trying every hair styling product on the market I gave up and decided there must be a styling tool to help with this. I tried different sized wands and flat irons and everything I could think of before stumbling upon the ""Deep Waver."" I really wanted this model but it didn't have automatic shut off and I didn't want to burn my house down, so I ended up buying this ""A-Wave-We-Go"" model solely because it has auto off. I freaking love this thing. My hair notoriously takes me over an hour to do, it's super thick, and I can do my entire head start to finish in about ten minutes now. I like to do varying wave styles throughout my hair, and the only bad thing I'd say about this is the knob to change the wave style is kind of hard to turn. I usually have to put some kind of cloth over it to get a grip on it and turn it. But even so I still give this 5 stars.

Not only does it have variable heat settings going up to 400 degrees; it heats up very quickly AND will automatically shut off if not in use after an hour (a safety feature to avoid burning your house down and conserve energy...joke! LoL) It is so much easier to use since it's smaller than other wave barrels I've owned. I've used a few that were just to bulky to handle (to a point I'd burn myself), but not this one. Also, I love that you can choose between three (wave) levels by turning the dial to achieve the wave you want. I've included pictures to show you what this awesome crimper can do, although the picture does not do it justice; it looks more beautiful in person. To achieve these particular waves, I set it to level one. I must add that it was my first time using it too; therefore I feel I'll get better and better as I continue to get used to it (I'm mainly used to straightening my hair). Overall, it is an awesome waver crimper that I highly recommend. It has variable heat settings based on your hair type; it heats quickly; shuts off if not in use after an hour (in case you forget to turn it off); gives beautiful, shiny, soft waves that look beautiful and actually lasts. I hope this review and/or pictures is helpful as I love helping others; if so, a helpful vote will make my day :-)",,430,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEPGYTOOOEOXG6WHEQW33IUNGMMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00ID8H838/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Bed Head,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G0EZS40N1VAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ID8H838,B00ID8H838

B00N8XFFDI,"Hamilton Beach Extra-Wide Slot Toaster with Shade Selector, Auto-Shutoff, Cancel Button and Toast Boost, 2-Slice, Red",4.4,1421,Careful 'n Selective,,Verified Purchase,Color: Red | Style: Toaster,B00N8XFFDI,https://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-2-Slice-Toaster-22623/product-reviews/B00N8XFFDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_fmt?ie=UTF8&formatType=current_format,5,"February 13, 2017",United States,"Love This 2-Slice Pop-Up Toaster – Lightweight, Fast, Efficient, Easy Operation, With Uniform Browning on All Sides","The media could not be loaded. For years and years, we had used our toaster oven to toast bread and muffins, and although our toaster oven is sufficient for baking and broiling, it really does not make ‘toast’. Although the bread would warm, it did not brown at all, until suddenly the bread would blacken and burn within seconds. Unfortunately, since the glass window in the toaster oven does not reach the bottom, we were never sure when the bread would start burning until we smelled it. Therefore we had two options, either eat warmed, untoasted bread, or take the chance and with any luck the bread would turn out very dark brown (not quite black), but unfortunately it usually would burn. Since we have enough kitchen appliances crowding our kitchen counter, I wanted a small 2- slice pop-up toaster, and without any extra ‘bells and whistles’. General Description: This Hamilton 2-slice pop-up toaster is perfect. It’s a lightweight compact toaster and it only measures 11” x 6”, with a 7 ¼” height, therefore it takes up very little space. In addition, since this toaster weighs less than 2 lbs. (1 lb. and 14 oz.), it’s not heavy, and I can easily put it away in a cabinet. It has a 30” electrical cord with a 2-prong plug. The color is a high gloss bright cherry red on the front and back, with a chrome finish on the top and sides. The spring loaded toaster slots are 5 ¼” long, x 1 ¼ “wide (to accommodate the thickness), and with a depth to fit and toast a 4” slice of bread, muffin, a sliced bagel or a sliced roll. This pop-up toaster has the cord storage area on the end and the cord remains coiled up securely and out of the way. The other end has the controls, which consists of a lever that is so easy to operate that I can use my pinky finger to push it down. A dial with a range of 1 – 7 controls the browning level, and there are segments between each number for a very precise toasting crunch and color. In addition there is a ‘cancel’ press button, to stop the toasting cycle and pop the slice up to the top. On the bottom is an attached crumb catcher tray that slides to the side for easy emptying and cleaning. Performance: There are 7 main settings for toast color and crunch, with the lightest at the number #1 and the toasting gets progressively darker and crispier as the dial adjustment moves to #7. I prefer the #4 toasting level for a light brown color and a mild crunch. This takes approximately 1 ½ - 2 minutes in the toaster, and the chrome sides remain comfortable to the touch. My toast cooks evenly in both slots and both sides of each slice have the identical crunch and color. We are very pleased with this Hamilton 2-slice pop-up toaster. It’s lightweight, fast and efficient, and it browns both sides of the bread evenly. We use it for bread, sliced bagels, hamburger buns, and English muffins, it is exactly what we needed.",,146,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG64QPK2SOOKNS7IXKMB7GJ6G7HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00N8XFFDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Hamilton Beach,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPPJJ3P9BK7RZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N8XFFDI,B00N8XFFDI

When it arrived, I plugged it in outside and cycled it a few times but did not notice any odd chemical odors. I did notice that the center element did not glow as brightly as the two outer elements, so I thought I would have to return it. Then I started using it for toasting. This toaster had me smiling after the first time I toasted an English muffin. It was toasted to perfection. with the nooks and crannies of each half pointed toward the center. Then I tried it with the nooks and crannies of each half pointed toward the outside and again perfection. Then I realized that the lower glow from the inner element is probably by design to keep the temperature even throughout the toaster. I would often have to cut off burnt edges of English muffins when using our old Proctor-Silex 4 slice toaster. This Hamilton Beach 2 slice toaster has guides that grip and hold the slices centered in each slot, and I have yet to have any burnt edges after toasting 22 muffins so far. It took a couple tries to find the right thermostat setting for English muffins, but once I found 6.5 out of 7 is ideal, I have not had to touch the dial at all. I noticed in the Proctor-Silex that as a toaster ages, the setting has to be lowered not raised slightly as the years go by, so I am glad it is now at the high end of the range. When the toaster shuts off, the muffins are not easy to remove from the toaster. No problem. Raising the handle lifts both halves above the toaster where they can easily be pulled out of the toaster with fingers about an inch above the top of the toaster. I am glad this toaster has the simple hinged large trap door on the bottom. It is so much easier than dealing with a removable tray. I just unplug the toaster, grip it with one hand by the top center trim and carry it to the sink. At the sink I slide the cylindrical catch on the trap door to open it and shake the crumbs into the sink. This could not be easier. For only $15, this toaster is a very pleasant surprise, not just because of the price, but because it works so much better the the $60 toaster it replaced..",,4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHVZ6NXMDMKWARARSOP6SRVI3WWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00N8XFFDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Hamilton Beach,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DQDYI88WY14X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N8XFFDI,B00N8XFFDI

The first two purchased were exactly the same as this red one except black in color and one model lower because it did not have the cancel button featured on the front like the red one does. I decided to purchase this red one on Amazon for $3.00 more than the black style because of the cancel button feature. The black model without the cancel button had to be unplugged to get the toast to pop out if you needed to. For both the black and red toaster, in all the years I have used this brand toaster I have never experienced any toast get stuck inside or fail to pop out. I believe my first purchase was in 2014 so these last a long time. The red toaster settings seem to be more precise than the black toaster making perfect every time. I like my toast crisp and absolutely no burning on the bread as burnt toast makes my stomach sick - this toaster wins my vote for not burning and making perfect toast every time. I use a higher setting for English muffins and toaster waffles and a lower setting for regular toast. I have used room temp, refrigerated, and frozen products in this toaster without any problems. I have not used any sugar-coated type product in the toaster and recommend they are toasted in a toaster oven to keep the sugar frosting on the top. I recommend this product for its ease of use and precise settings for a variety of products and have always had excellent results in my experience - the toasted product comes out just the way I wanted it without a lot of hassle making adjustments.",,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG7OTFHUL6ZA2HCDM355NXNMTRZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B00N8XFFDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Hamilton Beach,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R216JTCBGAPWLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N8XFFDI,B00N8XFFDI

I read some reviews complaining about over-toasting - I don't have this problem. On setting 3 (out of 6) it's a bit under-toasted to my taste, and 4 is perfect. And, it works surprisingly fast! I hated so much staring at old toaster for long minutes, begging to pop already as life were mercilessly slipping away. Cons: The lever feels kind of flimsy and I am afraid to break it, especially since you need to push it a bit hard to lock it down. This is my main concern about durability. Also, the top panel does get very hot (the side panels do not), so be careful. Other notes: 1. I let run empty a couple of times before using it with bread, to let out some weird smell that it had in the beginning. It went away quickly. 2. Color, in case you care: It's brighter than shown in the product images. It's as if they were taken in a dimly lit setting. The actual color is fiery red with a slight lean towards cherry, or something like that.

(It still worked, but the knob on the lever fell off, and I didn't want to mess with trying to re-attach it.) My recent purchases of a coffee pot, and later, a can opener, led me to look at Hamilton Beach toasters. I'm glad I did. Just wanted a basic, 'getterdone' toaster, and found this 2-slice toaster with the perk of being able to toast bagels, if I wanted to. Haven't tried a bagel yet, but confident it will be perfectly toasted, when I do. I love Brownberry brand bread, and the loaves tend to be shorter, but wider than standard bread loaves, although the slice sizes are the same width as regular bread. This toaster accommodates the wider length slices nicely. On first use, I thought the appliance might be defective, as pressing the lever to make the bread descend into the toaster took the slices down, but there appeared to be no action. Pressed the lever a little farther down, and voila! the toaster engaged. To my surprise and delight, there are little 'cages' inside the toaster that close in on the bread, and keep it from curling while toasting. Didn't expect that, but what beautiful results it yielded. I'm very happy with my purchase, especially since it was at a reasonable price.

Easily held a queen and twin air mattress. Had about 2-3 feet left at the other side of the tent for shoes, luggage, dog bed and dog (you know, the ushe). Two adults and one kid slept comfortably. We're in the South so the well-ventilated style is fine for no colder than it gets here in the spring and fall. We stayed comfortable in about 45-50 degree weather bundled in our sleeping bags. For much colder weather though, I'd say go with a less-ventilated tent or prepare to layer. Easy, two pole criss-cross set-up. The instructions failed to tell us what to do with the guy lines at the four corners of the rain fly so we had to do some detective work and study the pictures on the packaging (turns out you just stake them: not sure what purpose this serves except to secure it in windy conditions since there are other guy lines to space the rain fly away from the tent). We haven't had it in wet weather yet so I can't comment on that. My 6' hubs stood easily in the center of the tent. It has a ring at the top so you could hang a lantern (though the ring is closed so you'll need a carabiner or hook to attach your lantern to the ring). The side pockets are the standard size ones, big enough to hold a phone and book. If you want to stake the floor vent to keep it open, you'll need to bring some extra line or place the back of the tent close to the edge of your tarp/footprint because the elastic tab on it is pretty short. I will say I wish Coleman made add-on screen porches for this model for shoes, etc. but there is enough room in the tent for your gear if you don't mind having it inside. It came with a door-mat size piece of tarp that had no explanation in the instructions so maybe that's a shoe mat? Overall, easy set-up and plenty of space.

It's generally very durable and good quality. I have owned several of their tents over the years and they generally last 10-15 years of solid use before there is a reason to replace them. I think this tent will be no exception to this. The good stuff: Good size for a four person tent. As you likely know, this does not mean you are fitting a king bed in there but 4 people with sleeping bags should fit fine. If you are sleeping four adults you likely will have to store your gear someplace else. I use the tent with two kids so we have some extra room. Easy to put up. If you have put up a tent before this should take you less than 10 minutes. Only thing you don't have out of the gate to setup is a mallet to drive in the stakes into the ground. Rainfly is already waterproofed. A common mistake when buying a tent is assuming that the whole thing is already waterproofed. This is not always true. In this case, Coleman did you a solid and already took care of the rainfly. I would still suggest getting some waterproofing fluid and doing all the other seams but this is not mission critical if you are in a hurry to get out in the woods. Has lots of nice features. A door mat, a place to slip an extension cord into the tent for power, lantern strap, some nice storage pockets, an optional floor level vent... pretty much everything you can expect in this size tent. Easy to take down as well! This tent might be the first one that I have every been able to simply roll up and fit into the bag without any trouble. There is even a ""rip cord"" on the bottom of the storage bag that expands it to make it simpler to get it in. I didn't even have to use that feature. It rolls right up and into the bag. Just use the pole bag as a guide in terms of width and use it to roll up the tent and push out the air. Fits in the bag no problem. The bag is also pretty small so storage is easy. The less good stuff: As with any tent in this price range the stakes that come with it won't hold up to constant use in hard ground. If you are going someplace with clay (like Georgia, for example) you will eventually bend them and have to replace them. While this is a con I don't think this is something to be unexpected. The included ones work fine in most soil and replacements are cheap. The included door mat does not attach to the front of the tent and has to be staked down. This makes rolling up the shoes to toss them inside at night not very feasible unless you just leave the mat floating. Again, not a huge con but would be a nice feature. I usually do this to prevent morning dew from getting our shoes wet. The strip of fabric that covers the zippers on the door can get snagged in the zipper from time to time. You need to carefully back it up a bit to pull it out. I don't think this issue is specific to this tent as I have encountered it before on others. Overall, this is a great tent that will provide many years of service.

Before purchasing the Coleman Sundome 3 Person Tent I reviewed a lot of tents. This one in particular I read both negative and positive reviews on this one and then decided to go for it after debating for 1 month. For reference i am a 5'5 female and my husband is 6ft tall & we had plenty of room for us and our camping gear. I'll be honest we were skeptical on the waterproof aspect of this tent. We set up camp and it poured the rain and the tent stayed dry inside. I rated 4 star water résistance because the inside bottom corner has a place to run cords through it zips but not well that part little water droplets got through. Nothing crazy though. Zippers on the tent aren't made too good kinda made cheap but if you take care of your tent they should last. We were nervous about the rainfly seeing as the tent top is all mesh and we ended up loving the rainfly for the top and bonus it never leaked and we were in a rainstorm. The Sundome mesh top will be perfect for clear nights and star gazing. I purchased this on a tuesday and it arrived thursday so quick shipping which is a bonus. Super easy set up 5- 10 minutes to fully equip. We are excited to use this on more camping trips this summer. Would recommend to anyone purchasing a tent for two and their camping gear.

I don't do as much camping lately, but I needed to replace an old tent with one that would fit my husband and I, and our two young girls. I also wanted them to be able to play in it in the back yard. We've had a very stormy summer in western Pennsylvania with record rains. This tent stayed up thru two giant thunderstorms dumping record rain fall. After the first storm it was 100% dry inside! I checked thoroughly. The second let a little water in, possibly blowing up under the rain fly, and as anyone who has camped in a tent before knows, some of that you can't avoid. The tent has really nice interior windows/zipper blinds -a must for me, I like to be able to see out and control privacy and ventilation without taking the rain fly on and off. It also has a lower vent in the back as part of the rain fly. Nice and private allowing for ventilation. The front also has one of those power ports! I haven't used them too much but I feel like those would be so fun and useful! Especially if camping during a road trip at KOA's or something. You're able to run an extension cord into the tent without tripping over it in the door or allowing water in during rain. It has two nice tent pockets but only one hook from the peak of the ceiling. That's kind of a bummer, but you could easily sew an extra hook on and attach hanging cup holders, pockets, or those new ""entertainment lofts"" to hold iPads or tablets to watch movies on.

They are light years better than any other brand at a similar price point. Case in point: I bought this to replace my last Coleman 4-man dome tent, and that one lasted me over 20 years. It's a breeze to set up. I can do it alone in under 10 minutes. My only complaint: like I said, I got this to replace another Coleman 4-man dome tent, so seemingly the exact same tent. Except it's not. It's so much smaller. For one thing, The ceiling is much lower. This means not only can I not stand up in the middle, (which is no big deal,) but the walls are also much more slanted, making the space inside less usable and sort of wasted. My rule of thumb is usually that if you use air mattresses a tent is comfortable for half the amount of people it's advertised for, (so an 8 man comfortable for 4, a 6 man comfortable for 3, etc,) but this 4-man tent is really only about right for 1 person on a single air mattress and their gear.

Very waterproof. Withstood severe rain and wind,"Update: My two kids and I used this tent for a Scout camp this past weekend. The first night was torrential rains and heavy winds for at least 6 hours. I sat awake wondering when the rain would start getting into the tent, waiting for my rain cover to blow off or for water to start accumulating. In the morning our tent was in one piece and completely dry inside. I didn't use a ground cover or tarp. Just the tent. We had not one drop of water in our tent. The other families that were in tents all had rain in their tents. One family had at least an inch of water. This tent was fantastic and I was so happy to wake up in a dry tent. Please note I did buy and use better tent stakes, I upgraded from the stakes that were included. I would highly recommend better tent stakes. But with better tent stakes I highly recommend this tent if you think you are going to be in rainy conditions. I researched a lot of tents prior to purchase. I needed something easy to set up on my own. I wanted a tent that could withstand heavy rain. I also wanted a tent that could comfortably sleep 4 (2 Kids 2 adults). This tent met all these requirements. I was able to set up almost the entire tent on my own and quickly. The tent itself was no problem but I’m only 5’2” so struggled with the rainfly but I was able to get it with help from my 7 year old. The size of this tent is perfect. I used it with just one queen air mattress and there was so much room. I was able to set up a little table (just a bin)and play mat inside the tent for my kids. On night 2 it downpoured and we were kept completely dry. I could easily stand up in the tent. But again I’m fairly short. This would be an excellent tent for warm weather camping. I would not use for cold weather. I live in Minnesota and took this tent camping this past weekend. I thought I’d be ok temp wise. The temperature both nights dropped to 36 degrees and due to all the ventilation the tent got pretty cold. However this was my error in using this tent in cold weather. The tent itself is great.

It does seem to be solid quality, and the bottom seems to be weather proof - the bottom is essentially a tarp attached to the tent sides. With that said, I got the 4 person size, and it was for just me with a camping cot, which wouldn't fit front to back, and barely fit side to side. If you aren't using a cot, it would be fine as a 2 person tent with gear, but 3 people would start to feel cramped, never mind 4. It's also not a tall tent. I'm 6'1"" and the next tent I buy will be one I can fully stand in, or at the very least only have to slightly duck. Can't blame the product for my own personal preferences though when it comes to the cot and my size - if I wanted more room, I should have gotten a bigger tent, right? The tent sets up easy and is pretty self-explanatory: 1. Lay it out 2. stake the corners 3. insert the poles, arch and attach at the plug fitting, then clip to the tent 4. inset the rain fly pole, anchor the rain fly to the tent, stake the rain fly on the sides It took me about 10 minutes to set up, and it stayed tight all weekend. Overall, I trust the Coleman brand - it's solid quality at prices you can afford - I got a nice deal on this tent and got it for about 38% below the normal pricing, so what's not to like about that?",,1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGY6CJKGYMVZFHE5ONDCUSRAYEEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019N9W7WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GPXWC2FL8022/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019N9W7WC,B019N9W7WC

For around $60.00 you are getting a great tent used for the occasional weekend camping trips with your kids or family. I purchased 3 of these tents to use for backyard campouts/sleepouts that my kids want to have with their friends. For the price, they are great for that. I will also use one of the tents with my son for weekend Cub Scout campouts. Again, this is the perfect tent to use during a summer/fall weekend campouts where you are not carrying the tent a long distance. What this tent is NOT is a backpacking tent or a tent to be used often or in very cold weather. I have a Kelty Trail Ridge 3 tent that I use for backpacking or when the weather is supposed to be under 40 degrees F overnight. It has better poles, is lighter and much smaller (making it about half the weight of the Coleman Sundome 4). Again, this tent is not perfect for all activities. The fiberglass poles are not suited for heavy winds or very frequent use. The Rain-fly only covers the top half of the tent meaning in a heavy rain/wind, you are likely to get wet. The stakes are the cheap tin one that bend after only a few uses. So if you intention is to campout for several weeks at a time or go backpacking, look elsewhere. But for 60 bucks, this tent is a great value for the accessional family campout for a long weekend. A few other notes: - This is the same 3-pole Dome tent that Coleman has been making for a long time. However this Sundome 4 has a few revision I like. The rainfly has 2 sets of Velcro attachments that connect it to each of the main tent cross poles. In previous version there was only one attachment per side. - Also, this version has a small loop in the center of the tent to allow you to hang a small light. I recommend this one as a cheap and lightweight tent light ( ) - Lastly this version has a small ground vent that allows air to come in from the bottom of the tent to help reduce condensation. Also, there is a small zippered section in the front left corner that would allow you to bring an extension cord into the tent away from the door (where it is a tripping hazard). If you need a tent to use during the warm nights and for 2-4 days at a time, this is a great inexpensive option.",,23,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGLGN4JFOLU2Q2XPUDEOZRSQYNUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019N9W7WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSM9ZZ3IUAO7Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019N9W7WC,B019N9W7WC

You could set this up in a few inches of standing water and still be dry inside. The superior venting allows vents to be open in the rain without water intrusion. The screened ground-floor vent is large and creates a natural air flow allowing hot air to flow up and out while cool air flows in at the bottom vent. Unadvertised was that the tent (even the 2-person tent) included a stakable mud mat for outside the doorway. Also, a nice Coleman touch was the heavy duty carry bag. Some tents come with a bag that is the same light fabric as the tent, but those do not hold up well to the abrasion that the carry bags endures in handling and storage. The carry bag was also a bit over-sized. Other brands minimize material use by making a carry bag that fits a machine-packed, unused tent. After the first use of those other tents, it is nearly impossible to get the tent back into the carry bag. NOT SO with the Coleman bag.

We've been camping in 95 degree heat, temps in the 30's at night, and heavy rain and wind. We stayed dry in the rain and wind, it vents really well in the heat, and it does reasonably well in cold temps. I am pleasantly surprised. I have never owned a Coleman tent before but I'm pretty impressed so far. This review is after our first 3-night camping trip. We bought the 6-person tent. This is a nice tent for the price if you consider what it's made for and what it's not made for. I recommend this for 2 people (and 3 dogs) or a small family. The tent is half mesh so this tent is great for warm weather, not so great for cold weather. It is very breathable though so condensation is not a problem. We put a queen mattress inside and there is just enough room on the sides to walk bent over or for some gear. The temperature got down into the mid 40's at night and we were plenty warm enough with our good sleeping bags. The third day was about 95 degrees in the daytime and the tent vented as well as any tent would. You could remove the rain fly if you wanted but I prefer the privacy. It's really easy to set up, really easy. It took us less than 15 minutes to set up. The tent pegs are just the standard cheap tent pegs that any tent comes with. We have nicer tent pegs that we always use. Always put a tarp down underneath the tent as a ground cover. We would not take this tent if the weather forecast called for rain or wind or freezing temps. We have a much more expensive tent if we are going to be camping in extreme conditions. I wouldn't call this a 3 season tent. I would call this a summer tent. I like it for its simplicity and convenience. The little zippered corner to run an extension cord through is a nice touch. So, I recommend this for light duty camping. I would take a different tent for more extreme conditions.",,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHKCULXAE7N4MCW7MKALDQOSSJUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019N9W7WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C9Y78S0XXQQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019N9W7WC,B019N9W7WC

It sets up and comes down very easily -- I'm an out-of-shape old woman and I did it by myself. It exactly fits my ""full""-sized futon mattress, which means that yes, it will fit two people ... but they'd better be pretty friendly. This tent has withstood snow, sleet, and rain without a leak. I did have to poke at the rain fly before I got up on the morning after a sleety ""winter mix"" of precipitation. The fly was heavy with icy snow that would have all gone down my back (and probably into the tent door as well!) if I hadn't reached out through the top of the door only, to jiggle the roof and make that stuff fall before I got out. There is a small risk of rain getting inside when you enter or exit during a storm, as the fly doesn't protect the bottom of the door, and if the door itself falls inward (as it tends to do), it will drip all over inside. But that's easily avoided when you know the risk, and it's really the only problem I've had with this tent. No condensation inside. No leaks. On clear nights I've slept without the rain fly, so I could see the stars through the generous screened areas. The rain fly is easy to remove and replace, though I wouldn't want to have to replace it in a big quick hurry if it started raining during the night, so I do check the weather forecast before I take it off. Both of the ""windows"" that are less well covered by the rain fly have zip-up covers in case it's raining sideways (or, I suppose, if the wind is just too much inside). There's a nice vent at the back of the tent near the floor, so there's excellent air exchange inside even when there's little or no wind.

I can say the tent ventilation was good. It was hot and humid with a bit of a breeze. The breeze was definitely welcome when in the tent! I also used a fan in the tent, just to keep some cool air flowing overnight. The second day out, we had heavy thunderstorms come through. We had 3 storms that day and rain throughout the night. The tent was dry and never leaked. I completely forgot about the zipper in the corner for running power through, since I never expect to use it, and it never leaked in all that rain. If you're familiar with Florida's Hurricane season, you understand the storms I went through! Overall I recommend this tent. It may be heavier than the more expensive tents, but it's solid! I set this tent up in my backyard to test it out and make sure I liked it. It does have some weight to it, but I'm a newbie to camping, so I can't compare it to anything. I can say, I am happily surprised with the quality of the tent. It was bigger than I thought it would be and roomy on the inside. I feel like maybe I would have been happier with a 2 person tent, but I guess I can stretch out more now! 1) From the start, the carrying bag is good quality. It has a tear away at the bottom, to expand the bag, if needed. Instructions are stitched into the bags interior! 2) I think I'll upgrade the poles to aluminum eventually. The poles that come with it are just metal and plastic pieces. 3) The tent comes with a foot pad to place in front of the door, which I think is a nice touch! 4) the material of the tent and rain fly seems like a good quality, especially for the price. 5) the rain fly is reinforced where the poles go into it and seems well stitched as well. 6) The zipper seems like good quality.

It takes 15 minutes to set up and 10 to take down. It folds nicely and fits back into the bag. Based on forum advice I got some nail type tent pegs that were easy to drive into the ground and a rubber mallet. So I have not used the ones that come with the tent, so I had a very easy time setting it up. The poles were already connected by a string and I had to thread them through and clip them on with the attached clips. I also got a tarp for the bottom of the tent based on advice on some reviews posted here, but as I learned it's better to leave the tarp off in rainy weather as water can pool on it and make the tent wet. It would be better to get a tent footprint to put under it. The rain fly is easy to install too and the included cords helps make sure the rain fly is stretched out away from the vents. I had carried a seam sealer but reviews advised not to use it as the tent remains dry. This tent is very well ventilated so it gets cold and airy in the tent in the night even if the temperatures are in 50s. Someone suggested putting a blanket on top of the tent to cover the vents. I did carry a transparent shower curtain for that purpose, but haven't used it so far. This is a great tent for warmer summer evenings and temperatures 55 plus. We've used it in 35 plus temperatures but it's really, really cold and if I did not have an ultra warm 20+ degree sleeping bag I would have frozen. I also carry an extra blanket to put on top of the sleeping bag. The 4 person tent is 9ft by 7ft and it fitted an Intex Queen Mattress and there is a little room on all sides of the tent after fitting in the mattress. If you push it to one side then there is place for all the bags, and my dog. In comparison this 3 person tent is 7ft X 7 ft and it just fits a queen mattress and no more. It's just enough for 2 adults. In fact, if you inflate the mattress with a car pump it's a bit tough to get it into the tent fully inflated. You may need to almost inflate and finish off once it's inside the tent, but for that you either need to have a separate hand pump or be able to bring the car really close. Of course, you can also use an air pad instead of an air mattress! It's a compact tent so it's easier to warm it up, it's much tougher to stand inside a 3 person tent vs. a 4 person tent. The white walls of the tent reflect light well and there are 2 pockets on the side where you can put a flashlight facing upward to illuminate the whole tent. Another feature I like is was that the bottom of the tent is bathtub style and comes up all around about 3-4 inches which helps keep dirt and water out. It's also advisable to pitch the tent on higher ground slightly sloping downwards so that the water flows downward away from you. The pull down takes very little time and I figured out finally how to roll it back tightly so it fits back inside the bag with all accessories. You just need to make sure you have the door and window unzipped so you can let all the air out and then it rolls up tight. On a recent trip to Crater Lake, OR we took off the rain fly as there was no chance of rain and were able to gaze at the Milky Way, and saw many shooting stars through the rain fly. It was magical. I always think I sleep better in this tent than I do in my own bed. I do carry ear-plugs though as some campers can be late sleepers or some camp sites can have a lot of highway noise. This tent is still going strong after about 10 camping trips or more. I took a time lapse video of my daughter putting up the 4 person tent. With a little help, it's even easier to put up, but she wanted to demonstrate putting it up with no help. It took her about 15 minutes, if there is someone to hold and align the poles it takes less time. The 3 person tent is even easier to put up as the poles are shorter.",,45,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZAAOPTGKDWVSXLIKHMUUPYN52Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019N9W7WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JG70KBWS88NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019N9W7WC,B019N9W7WC

My partner and I spent weeks researching a good 4 person tent to take camping in the southern colorado rockies. And we found it! This tent is extremely spacious. The reason we bought such a large tent is because we have 3 dogs and we were all able to have our own space and be totally comfortable. This tent is perfect for people with dogs because it’s heavy duty & when we went camping, it withstood the power of their little claws & didn’t rip - even when they jumped up on the sides to try and look out the windows! It was an extremely easy setup and breakdown - took us 10 minutes at most. This tent is also completely waterproof.

B019N9W7WC,"Coleman 4-Person Dome Tent for Camping | Sundome Tent with Easy Setup , Navy/Grey",4.7,6936,Learning as I go,,Verified Purchase,Size: 6 Person | Color: Green,B004J2GUP4,https://www.amazon.com/Coleman-4-Person-Camping-Sundome-Setup/product-reviews/B004J2GUP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_fmt?ie=UTF8&formatType=current_format,5,"May 20, 2018",United States,Versatile tent for the price,"We’ve owned the sundown 6 for 2 years and in that time, we have camped for over 70 nights in a variety of conditions. Over one summer alone, we travelled for 6 weeks across 27 states and 2 provinces, camping the entire way. Here are the pros and cons we discovered along the way. 1. It held up through some massive rain storms. For the record, we always spray our tents, and especially the seams, with silicone at the start of a camping season. Additionally, we managed to squeeze 2 queen sized air mattresses into the tent, and then shared that space between 5 people. We just fit in width, but it was naturally difficult to keep all blankets, pillows and even the corner of the mattress out of contact with the side wall. Experienced campers know that contact=leaks in a rain. Despite these constraints, the tent kept us dry throughout some intense and long rains, with no more than 1/4 cup worth of water pooling in a corner where we have contact issues. In fact, our sundown 4 kept my husband and son dry on a group trip where many others had to bail because their expensive tents were leaking extensively. 2. It sets up and take down fairly easily. If at least two corners of the tent are staked before lifting the poles, a single person can set it up. On our road trip we were constantly setting up and taking down our tent, and it didn’t become cumbersome at all. 3. In hot climates the tent is very airy, however the mesh roof makes for cold nights when sleeping in cold environments (aka Yellowstone in July). 4 I do not like how low the mesh roof comes down on two sides of the tent. If the rain fly is staked our tightly, then neighbors from the side can see in (a little bit) through the mesh. Think of the small gap between rainfly and mesh as similar to an awkwardly placed gap in a public bathroom stall door. One can’t see much—but it’s enough to make a person standing or sitting to get changed a little uncomfortable. That means that I had to lay down to get changed. It was also enough for my pesky son to threaten his sister that he might peek in...siblings. 5. The tent has held up in some fairly windy weather. However, all guys lines do attach to the rain fly, so it can make stargazing in windy weather difficult. We opted to sleep sans rain fly in Badlands National Park. The wind battered the sides of the tent, which simultaneously battered me! If you like to sleep under the stars, be prepared to make your own guy lines. 6. It actually folds into the bag...a couple half folds and a triple fold before rolling (fold it right and there is even a little room to spare). 7. It has held up under a lot of activity without replacing any parts. However, year 3 ( which might be equivalent to year 10 for once-a-year campers) and the zipper is starting to split at the top. Not bad for the price of the tent. We plan to camp around the NW this summer for another 6 weeks and have decided to go with a larger 10x14 tent to actually fit those 2 queen mattresses. But we have stashed this tent under the floor in our van just in case. Many National Park sites can’t guarantee more than a 12x12 pad, and this tent folds up small enough to be a back-up. With a 10x10 footprint, it can go anywhere.",,8,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AECCVJLZX64Q57ZDKCBWHBQXIQUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019N9W7WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGYIX7ZK5J0L1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019N9W7WC,B019N9W7WC

The ventilation was great for 70-80F (but again, it was windy the whole time) The set up is considerably simple (not pop up kind simple, but my camping expert husband said it was easy, I just followed his instructions and helped out). By the way, the metal stakes were not study enough for sand so we bought some heavy duty plastic camp stakes instead. I also bought a heavy duty tarp from Harbor freight to put underneath the tent as the bottom of the tent itself did not feel half as sturdy as the one I got. Zippers worked fine (had to pull the fabrics closer together in order to zip up the door so we wont rip the zipper). And mesh bags on both sides of the tent were perfect for phones, glasses, etc. The interior seems spacious, we fitted 2 twin size air mattresses with a gap in between for walkway and belongings (PS I was able to stand up inside the tent lol). The cool blue color was a big plus.

Setup was about 10 minutes and didn’t even require directions to figure out. The durability seems to be good. However, I feel this is something I won’t be able to provide feedback on until I see how it holds up over the next few trips. What I think is the most important thing to mention, and why I felt so strongly to give 5 stars is how well it held up during two nights of thunderstorms on my most recent trip. First I was nervous to freeze because the temps were in the 50s and I didn’t have anything special for a sleeping blanket. Somehow with all the windows zipped up, it stayed pretty toasty in the tent. On top of staying warm, we stayed completely dry! There were no leaks or drips anywhere. On the second night, our blankets that were pressed between the side of the tent and our air mattresses became a little damp but that could’ve been from condensation because there was no visible water in the tent.

Given the quality of the materials and finished product, this is a great value. First use was in 50 degree F and 50% humidity. The tent handled those conditions no problem. The air flow can be controlled somewhat and felt just right without tying anything closed or otherwise trying to stop the natural air flow within the tent. Obviously, the tent itself has no insulation, but the temperature inside was very comfortable given the above mentioned conditions. I can see going down another 10-20 degrees F and being totally fine with this tent and standard sleeping bags. Below that you will probably need additional tarps to put over it to block air flow and warmer than standard sleeping bags. I cannot attest to the rain resistance of the tent, however, it looks like it will handle light to medium showers with relative ease. The floor is tarp material with a fair amount of water resistance, and makes up the lower 4-6 inches of the walls. From there up is standard tent material you would find on many other tents at this price point. The mesh makes up a great deal of the upper portion of the tent, and all of that is covered by the rain fly when it is on. The rain fly itself is the same material as the tent walls. Air flows between the rain fly and the mesh sections. You can close that up to some degree to control the air flow. Additionally, there is a vent on the back wall near the floor, but high enough to not be a splashing water during rain problem. There is also a very tiny zippered opening on the front wall to bring in an extension cord. There are also two zippered, large windows. One on the back wall, one on the door itself. The D door is well thought out, and features a flap to keep rain out on the lower half. Setup is a breeze, even for the novice. It is very intuitive and straightforward. You have three poles to assemble, two for the tent and one for the rain fly. Slide them through, clip, and plug in at the ends. Thats pretty much it. There are some little velcro straps here and there to further secure the poles to the tent and rain fly. Put the third pole in the rain fly and then attached to the tent with the straps with clips. Tie down as needed, and you are done. There is also a floor mat for the entrance in the bag. This tent will stand on its own and does not absolutely need to be staked or tied to something. Its optional. Recommend you buy some additional parachute cord and maybe some heavier-duty stakes, as is pretty much always the case with every single tent on the market. Pack up is also a breeze. With minimal effort I was able to get it all in the box it came in and then into the carry bag. You do not have to use that box, and you can discard it and just use the carry bag. I like the squarish dimensions, so I kept the box. Otherwise, it will be more of a gym bag when packed. At any rate, plenty of room in there for additional stakes, parachute cord. If you manage to pack it tight, you could even fit a floor tarp in there (not included). 4 people is actually possible with this tent, but not with gear. Maybe some backpacks, but thats about it. You can fit two full size air mattresses, or a queen plus a twin. It will be tight either way, and double stack air mattress will make it even tougher. But, it is possible. A full plus twin is more realistic, and there will be some room for gear. We just use a full and have tons of room for gear, coolers, etc. Overall, fantastic tent at this price. Love the navy color scheme, and worth the extra couple bucks. I would not call this a hiking tent, as it weighs over 10 pounds. More if you buy heavier stakes, additional floor tarp, etc. But, you could make it work for hiking if you share the loads. For the occasional camper, this is perfect.",,21,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGDPTLEREHBHQPBSR23SUZNBHQJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019N9W7WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BLLXN5RNMZRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019N9W7WC,B019N9W7WC

Quite honestly, I think if we took better care of it (like completely dried it off after each camping trip and sprayed waterproofing on every year in the beginning of camping season) we could have used it for a another year or two. But the old one got a bit moldy and smelly and the roof started leaking a bit, so we decided to order a new one for upcoming road trip. Looked into some other brands for a few days to see if there’s a decent competition for the sundome, and came to a conclusion that it is still the best deal for the price. Tarp floor material that comes up onto the walls of the tent is a GAME CHANGER if you get caught in seriousrain. The big side windows are amazing for ventilation and stargazing in dry weather, the rain cover protects very well even in toughest rain (although I still recommend applying a fresh coat of weatherproofing to the roof and walls yearly).

I originally purchased this tent because I had never camped before and thought it would be a once or twice a year thing, at most. However, I caught camping fever for the first time in my life and have since upgraded on the size of the tent that my wife and I choose to use. About us: We are 30 and 31 years old. I am 6'0 tall and 315lbs. She is 5'7 and well, I hope my wife doesn't read this or I could perhaps lose the ability to write another review, ever again. She has a few extra lbs. as well. That's not bad, honey! We fit in this tent comfortably when sitting or laying down on our Queen sized air mattress. With that being said; if you are over a few feet tall, don't expect to be standing up and changing clothes and or moving around in this tent. We had just enough space to stash our duffel bags and dirty shoes at the end, and that was all. Pros: Tent is great for easy and fast set up! No over-reaching involved here! Tent would be great for kids. Tent is a great second tent to own if you don't feel like dragging out the big tent, and or, if you choose to camp with someone who may not have their own. This is just a theory, but the low profile of the tent as well as the overall shape leads me to believe this would be a good all weather tent that would withstand higher winds and minor storms better than towering tents with large walls. Waterproofing: Tent is small and easy to waterproof. A single can of waterproofing was more than enough. Fingers/back won't get tired from holding the trigger and bending over for too long. - Less is more - Save $$$. Our larger tent took two cans and kinked my back/cramped my hand up pretty bad. Cons: Probably smaller than you will ultimately want, should you camp on a frequent basis Overall: This is a great tent as a back up tent or a tent for children.

We reset the tent up in our basement for a day to fully dry it out, with no issues and no mildew smell the next time we used it.

I was happily surprised at the build quality and the ease of use, here are some pros and cons: Pros: - Easy to set up (comes with detailed instructions, but if you've ever put up a tent before you will figure it out even without those) - Includes everything you need to make it waterproof and guard against wind and mosquitoes/pests - Plenty of places to hang a light inside - More than enough room for 2 average size adults, (I'm 6' 180lbs i could have fit 3 times comfortably with an air mattress, thankfully i didn't need to but just so you are aware it's perfect for 2) - Easy to disassemble and pack (literally takes 1 person about 5 minutes to break down and pack for travel, also comes with a carrying pouch) - Last but not least the price (less than 50 dollars including expedited shipping) In the picture above you can see my friend's tent on the left, that is also a 2 person tent but cost him nearly 500 dollars and what he got for that was a tent that does pack smaller and is lighter, but fitting 2 people in it is not easy, I tried the first night lol, never again) Cons: - I had trouble actually finding one but if i had one it would be the weight, and even that i think could have been attributed to my decision to get a 2 person rather than a 1. it is heavier than a more expensive tent and you will feel it if you are backpacking, which we were). - One more con, the pouch, nothing wrong with having one but once you unpack the tent good luck getting it back into the included pouch, a good idea, however poorly executed Bottom line; if you are looking for a cheap but durable and backpackable tent this is the one, although if you are thinking of saving weight I'd suggest a 1 person, this one will give you a good workout though and I was fine :) (we were backpacking on Isle Royale btw for 4 days so I packed and unpacked and set this up every time we stopped to camp, and had no issues, fantastic build quality for the price and well worth it in my opinion.",,18,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE2SB7YOYHTCPK6HJJ2XUN34BELA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019N9W7WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OXOKETU87BBT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019N9W7WC,B019N9W7WC

So since I've only used this for a weekend camping trip so far, and in ideal weather, I can't answer a lot but here are my opinions on it: - How many can fit? 6 KIDS could probably fit. If you're an experienced camper then you obviously already knew this wouldn't fit 6 adults (or even teens) but I just feel the need to specify this. Realistically though if you're using camping mats that aren't larger than a sleeping and are adults you could squeeze 4 with room for bags at your feet. Cot wise I was using a Tenton Sports Adventurer so with using that as a reference I would say you could squeeze a maximum of 3 in there with no real aisle space on either side (maybe a leg width?), this is assuming you use the end point to enter and leave as well as storing underneath the cots. If you want more elbow room then I wouldn't put more than 2 in of that size, you could definitely put 2 of the XXL version of Tenton's cot as well and have space for an aisle between in which case with larger cots you could probably fit 2 couples comfortably if there aren't a million bags to deal with. - Is set up easy? As someone who has grown up camping this is pretty much your standard tent design in terms of set up. I ended up at the campsite well after dark and had a veteran camper along with a friend who doesn't tent camp often for helping me set it up to which it took us less than 5 minutes to put up. Super easy and does not require instructions if you've ever put up a tent like it before. - How is break down? Last day of the camp out I ended up having to break down the tent alone so it took me maybe more like 10 minutes but with help it shouldn't take that long at all. I even managed to get it into the bag WITH SPACE TO SPARE.... I folded in half then into 3rds and it fit without any struggle with everything rolled up in the tent. Still shocked it fit that easily after years of struggling with other tents to fit back into their bags. - Is there headroom to stand? Yes, PLENTY of head room and probably the roomiest tent I have owned to date. I'm 5'5"" and even with a small hanging light I got for the top of the tent I still had an arms reach above worth of room. Closer to the walls obviously it's a bit shorter but I did not feel the slightest bit restricted like a normal small tent has. - Is it warm? On a sunny day with it entirely closed it got a tad warm when I checked in on it but with all the ventilation it has built in already it really doesn't get scorching like some tents do if you don't have any windows open. The first night with this tent it actually got pretty chilly and the tent was assuredly not meant for colder nights, with a better sleeping bag rated for colder weather you should be fine though... mine just was very old and not great against the cold anymore. - Does it hold up to rain? I camped in sunny weather, so I cannot personally review it from experience, but I would say this is not a tent that I would knowingly take on a camping trip that will have rain. The only real reason I say this is because the back has this little vent to let air in around head level if you're sleeping on the ground which is great for summer/warm weather but as someone that has been in a flooded tent before it just seems like a horrible feature if you're going up against a storm. Some reviews claimed this wasn't a problem though so perhaps it isn't as big of an issue as it just appears to be from my perspective at least. Overall I love this tent, wish it retained heat a bit more, but definitely look forward to using it again on the next camping trip!

Do yourself a favor and get this tent and a big tarp to go over it, and maybe a drop cloth to protect the bottom, and I promise you'll be dry in any storm. Plus, bonus points for being super easy to set up, and tall enough to stand in! Can't wait to use this tent again, it's better than any of the more expensive tents I've ever used. Tip for getting it back in the bag: Fold in half longways. Then fold in thirds longways. Then roll :) rain fly just folded a few times and rolled and had no problems getting it all back in the bag. EDIT: 4 years and many festivals, camping trips and a few girlfriends later, this tent is still going strong.

Still rating this tent.,"My tent just arrived yesterday. I struggled on what to give this tent for a rating because I just got it. I was thinking about giving it a 3 for average which seemed fair to start with. But after seeing how it handled the wind without breaking or tearing, I decided to give it a 4 because it surpassed my expectations. I plan on using this tent quite a bit this summer so I will update my rating and review as I go. I found the assembly instructions to be very basic but adequate. Anyone who has put up a tent like this before will have no problem. It took me about 15 minutes. Anyway, I set my tent up in my back yard yesterday to see how it looked and how it took on the elements. My first test was wind. I have a weather station and the average wind speed was 7 to 8 mph with gusts up to 17 mph. The back of the tent was torward the wind and when the gusts would come, the back of the tent would bow it quite a bit. I have read the reviews some people have written and see some have had problems with the poles breaking. This is what I was afraid of as I watched the back of the tent bow in. I wish I had taken a picture because it was substantial. Anyway, the poles did not break and the tent returned to it’s original form when the gust passed every time. I have seen the video on Amazon of the testing process Coleman puts their tents through. Not sure how much wind this tent is rated for but I’m pretty sure 17 mph is close to it’s max. The tent looks to be made very well for the price I paid for it. There are only two guidelines that come off the rain fly on the sides of the tent. The tent is staked down on all four corners of the floor plus a floor vent in the back of the tent. In all, there are only 7 stake down points that I could see. I feel if the tent had some guidelines higher up on each of the four corners of the main body of the tent it could withstand more wind. The stakes are ok but bend fairly easily if the ground is too hard or you hit a rock when pounding them in. I will be buying some better ones before I go camping. I left the tent up over night and checked on it this morning. It held up very well and only one of the stakes for the rain fly guidelines had twisted in the ground causing the guideline to come loose. I left the tent up because it was going to rain today. I need to know if I have any leaks before I take it out camping. It has been raining lightly for two hours now and my weather station says I’m getting .05 inches of rain an hour with a light steady wind of 2 to 3 mph. Far from what I would consider a hard rain but it’s still rain. I went out and looked at just the outside and the water seems to be beading up and running off the rain fly and tent very well. It is supposed to rain until 9 or 10 o’clock tonight so I will check for water on the inside in the morning. I’m hoping not to see any with such a light rain. If there is, I will definitely be spraying the tent down with a waterproofing spray before I take it out camping. Now for the pro’s and con’s. Pro’s: 1). Great tent for the price. If your on a fixed budget or are looking for a good starter tent you will not beat this one. 2). Very roomy inside. I plan on using this for two people, a shepherd and, all our gear. 3) There is an eyelet at the top of the tent so you can attach a lantern and two side pockets for stowing smaller needed items like a headlamp, cell phone, keys and, so on. 4). There is a small zipper in the bottom front left side of the tent for running wires. See my picture. It is covered by a little yellow strip of material to protect the zipper from the rain. You do not see this feature on most tents. I plan on using it with my solar panel so I can charge my power core, headlamp, cell phone and, other gear from inside the tent out of direct sunlight. 5). I was surprised at how much give the tent had at 17 mph gusts and did not break any poles or tear. It bounced right back to it’s original form. Con’s: 1). You may want to consider buying stronger tent stakes. 2). I wish there was a high point on each of the four corners for attaching extra guidelines. Although it handled 17 mph gusts very well the tent did bow in quite a bit. If I had to guess, the tent was reduce by almost half it’s size. If I was inside the tent I know I would have been annoyed being hit by it every time a gust came. I really don’t feel the tent as is, could handle much more then that. I’m thinking about how to attach extra guidelines in the corners without effecting the structural stability and elasticity of the tent. Make sure you pitch this tent in a sheltered area out of the wind if your expecting bad weather. Update 04/30/18 I went out the next morning after the light rain and the inside was dry. The following day saw more rain showers with substantially more rain. Checked the tent again today and it is still dry. After reading some of the reviews I really thought this tent would leak. Because this tent has preformed better then expected I have changed my rating to a five. I am going to seal the seams and spray waterproofing on the tent anyway because I would rather be safe then sorry. For the size and price of this tent you will not find a better deal. Just remember to pitch your tent in a sheltered area in you are expecting winds and you will not be disappointed. I think I have figured out a way to put up extra guidelines on each of the four corners so the tent will preform better with heavy gusts of wind. I will test it out and take pictures. More to come. That is all for now and there will be more updates coming.",,973,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEDBIHPLMDNJXQCPMPY7ZAUXZPHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019N9W7WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KR8T7UDBL1PU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019N9W7WC,B019N9W7WC

I just like to go a few times every summer and get away with my dog. This tent is perfect! I live in Oregon, so you can never be 100% certain when it will rain. Ever since I woke up in a puddle in an old tent, I make sure to only buy tents with this ""bathtub"" design. I just got this tent and set it up by myself in my living room and it took me probably less than 10 minutes. There was definitely enough room for 2 people. However, whoever sleeps on the inside/backside of the tent (next to the window) will definitely struggle to get out of the tent without waking/bothering the other person. This is an awesome tent though and I can't wait to try it soon! Also, I was able to repackage this tent back into it's carry bag with ease! There was no struggle at all! In fact, there's still enough room that I can toss a small hammer in for the tent stakes, and a small brush to dust off the tent before packing. However, the bag is expandable if you need more room to carry stuff. Just remove the tag/band on the bottom of the bag, and you'll have more storage room--which is genius in my opinion.

Our second tent was an instant double hub dome tent that had permanent poles that kept flipping upside down making it impossible to set up. (We returned that one.) This tent, however, is no-nonsense. Two poles to put the tent up. One extra pole to hold the rainfly up. We put the tent up in a Florida thunderstorm in less than 5 minutes. We took another 5 minutes to set the 7 guy lines. I didn't get the opportunity to spray and seam seal the tent since it was raining, but it did not leak through some very powerful Florida rainstorms, except for a few drops around the electrical port zipper. Seal that part especially. The tent moved around and shook through some rough ocean wind, but remained intact. The tent is tall enough to stand up in (6ft tall) with room for a queen sized air mattress and tons of space for your stuff. We had a cooler, a big box fan, and two pieces of luggage in there with room to spare. I would say it's perfect for 2 people, comfortable with 3, claustrophobic with 4, and you'd have to be desperate to fit 5 or 6. There is a port for your electrical cord. Two pockets are attached inside, and a welcome mat was included. Taking the tent down was just as simple. Just fold in half twice, then fold into thirds and roll up. It fit right into the bag with no problems. Easiest tent I've ever dealt with! I'd recommend a 10x10 tarp to go under the tent and a 10x20 tarp to go over it. There are two huge mesh panels on the top of the tent, which is great for ventilation, but bad for sideways rain that can sneak under the rainfly. I put the tarp longways over these vents and it kept out the sideways rain but there was still plenty of ventilation. There is a hook at the top to attach an LED light/fan. It was fantastic for warm/hot weather camping. Might be too much ventilation for late fall camping, though, unless I can figure out a way of blocking those mesh panels.

This was my very first time setting up a tent and camping out with 2 kids and 2 dogs in tow, and it took me just 15 minutes to set up the tent. Set up took 15 minutes from start to finish for a tent newbie like me with some help from one kid. Based on forum advice I got some tent pegs that were easy to drive into the ground so I did not use the ones that come with the tent, so I had a very easy time setting it up. The poles were already connected by a string and I had to thread them through and clip them on with the attached clips. I also got a heavy duty tarp for the bottom of the tent based on advice on some reviews posted here. I had to fold it slightly to make sure it stayed under the tent. then once the tent was all straightened out I drove in the pegs into the ground. The rain fly was easy to install too and the included cords helps make sure the rain fly is stretched out away from the vents. The 4 person tent is 9ft by 7ft and it fitted an Intex Queen Mattress that I inflated in 15 min with a handpump. There was a little room on all sides of the tent after fitting in the mattress. If you push it to one side then there was place for one small person. We had 1 adult and 2 teenagers in the tent and our 75 lb lab and we were pretty comfortable with room to turn while sleeping. There was not really room for more than one small duffel bag after packing in 3 people and a dog, so if you're using this as a backpacking tent and plan to store your gear you can only fit in 2 people. I was glad that I had got this size compared to the 3 person tent (7ft X 7 ft) as it would have only fitted in a queen mattress and no more, and we ended up needing more room. I think the 4 person is a great size for 2 people to sleep in comfortably and have a bit more room to bring in a kid if needed. I had carried a seam sealer but reviews advised not to use it as the tent remains dry. There was no rain that night, just a little moisture in the air. The tent is very well ventilated so it got cold and airy in the tent in the night. Next time I may carry something to cover the vent on one side or maybe a warmer sleeping bag as the night got colder than we had anticipated. This would be a great tent for warmer summer evenings. The white walls of the tent reflect light well and there are 2 pockets on the side where you can put a flashlight facing upward to illuminate the whole tent. Another feature I liked was that the bottom of the tent comes up all around about 4 inches which helps keep dirt and water out. It's also advisable to pitch the tent on higher ground slightly sloping downwards so that the water flows downward away from you. The pull down was just as easy as the put up. It was easy to bring down and fold up the poles. However, I could not fit it back inside the bag. How did they manage to fit it inside that tiny bag in the first place is a mystery. I put the pegs, poles and my extra tarp inside and will find another bag for the tent itself. Now that I've learned that's it's not too hard to set up a tent, I plan to go camping more often with this Coleman Sundome tent. Update 7/9/2015 - The 4 person tent held up well and has been put up and taken down about 5-6 times already. It takes just 15 minutes to set up and is very comfortable in 45 degrees plus weather with a warm sleeping bag. For colder temperatures, I wouldn't recommend this tent. It's very airy and the 2 side windows that zip down made it comfortable even in 70 degree weather. For even warmer days you can leave the rain fly off if there is no chance of rain. I figured out finally how to roll it back tightly so it fits back inside the bag with all accessories. You just need to make sure you have the door and window unzipped so you can let all the air out and then it rolls up tight. I also purchased the Coleman 3 person tent, it is about 7 ft by 7 ft inside and just about fits an Intex Queen size air mattress. On a recent camping trip the 3 person tent worked for 2 teenagers and a dog inside the tent. It is a compact tent for 2 people, you can fit in 2 adults but there won't be any room for bags. It's not the lightest tent I've seen, but it's fairly small and fits back easily into the bag it comes in. We set up this one about 4 times and took it down in different camping grounds. The pegs did not hold up well in hard ground but I'd purchased a set of better pegs from Amazon. I am really pleased with both the tents and will be using them for many more camping trips. Update 9/29/16 - This tent is still going strong, I had my daughter put it up by herself and took a time lapse video. With a little help, it's even easier to put up, but she wanted to demonstrate putting it up with no help. It took her about 20 minutes, if there is someone to hold and align the poles it takes less time. It rained for hours in the night and the next day on our last day - this was a trip to Glacier National Park. We were both warm and dry in our 4 person and 3 person tent and it was kind of fun to hear the rain beat hard against the tent. I had not applied any seam glue to either of the tents, but might do so in the future. Unfortunately, on a subsequent trip in late fall, the tent pole snapped as the person setting it up with my daughter did not have much experience and went too hard. I now have to figure out how to get a replacement pole.",,877,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZAAOPTGKDWVSXLIKHMUUPYN52Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019N9W7WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CPQ8NIQQDGG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019N9W7WC,B019N9W7WC

I bought this 2-man tent due to the low price and the high scoring reviews here at Amazon and the reviews are spot on. I had my eye on quite a few other tents at $125 to $250 but I have to say this one caught my eye early on because of the reviews. I said: ""wtf? Order it and see how it performs and if it was all a big lie then I'm out a measly $38!"" NOTE: On the advice of lots of folks here I purchased a small 2 oz bottle of ""Coleman Seam Sealer"" (available here or at Wal-Mart). The day the tent arrived I set it up outside on my back deck and sealed all the seams and let it dry for about 4 hours before folding it back up and putting it away. PROS: This tent is inexpensive, light weight, easy to erect, and does it's job quite well. It assembles in about 3 to 5 minutes (if you've done it once or twice). The instructions are a perfect guide if you cannot remember the 3 easy steps. CAMPING IN THE RAIN: So I went on my first camping trip with it this past weekend and I was caught in an off-and-on torrential downpour from 10 PM at night through 9 AM the next morning and guess what? I stayed completely dry and slept very well. I did forget to zip the small electrical cord opening shut for the first few hours and the sideways rain got a few drops in there until I realized it and zipped it tight. I left the vent windows open during the entire storm and had zero issues with water. TIP: Be sure to bring a couple of large black trash bags to put the tent into if you have to break camp while it is still raining. That prevented a huge wet mess inside the car when I departed the camp site. Time will tell if this is a durable product ... but so far so good.

I set it up in my backyard, to give it a trial run (and seam seal) before taking it out camping. There are pros and cons... Pros: Carry bag - the tent comes neatly packed in a carry bag, with tent, poles, rain fly, ground stakes, door mat, and instructions. Setup - Easy. Set up by myself, with rain fly, in under 15 minutes. Didn't have to look at the directions. Only suggestion would be to put the word ""front"" somewhere on the rain fly to indicate which way it goes. However, a quick glance at the packaging will tell you. Materials - the tent material seems to be of good quality, and should hold up well when taken care of. The zippers are not heavy duty, but i see no issues with them. The floor is heavy duty tarp material. Screens - the tent has large screen panels on the ""ceiling"", which makes for a great view when the rain fly is not on. There is an additional window, and screen on the door for extra viewing and airflow. Floor Vent - there is a vent near the rear of the tent, which allows for additional airflow. Cord access - there is a small zippered panel in the front corner, that let's you run an extension cord into the tent. Other ""Pros"": I got the Navy/Grey tent, and the colors are cool. Got some compliments from the neighbors on it. I like that the rain fly comes with the guy lines already attached. The interior gear pockets are fine, good for holding your phone. Wouldn't stuff them with anything heavy. There is a little ""ring"" at the center of the ceiling, to hang a small light. While you could technically fit 2 queen air mattresses, I would not. It leaves no floor space for gear. I will put in one mattress, and leave the other half of the tent for my kids Pack n' Play, and gear. It will fit the 3 of us comfortably. However, unless you intend to get cozy, I wouldn't advise this for 4 adults (but it could be done). Cons: Stakes - the stakes are just ok...they are the generic skinny steel ones. I would recommend spending an extra $10 bucks and buy some good ones. Footprint - the tent doesn't come with a footprint, though I imagine this helps keep the cost so low. Not a big deal, I use a tarp anyways. Door Screen - the upper half of the door can be unzipped to reveal the screen window. I really would have liked if the entire door could be screen, not just the top half. I also purchased some Coleman Seam Sealer, and sealed all the seams inside the tent, and the rain fly. Some of the seams are taped, but it's just good practice to spend the time to do this, no matter what brand/cost/etc tent you have. It saves headache down the road. Overall, I'm very pleased with the tent, and the cost. It will work well for short camping trips with a small family, couple, or individual.",,"1,393",https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGFQM34WXDFCJO5MAMFXYZPABD2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019N9W7WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36O3B5YVNZM22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019N9W7WC,B019N9W7WC

There's just two of us and we could probably fit a third person, but its nice and comfortably sized for two. It says it's for 4 people, but that would be a squeeze in my opinion. Maybe two adults and two children? I had read a review saying that it is hard to fit it all back in the back, but I had no problem at all. It all fits nicely with room to spare. There's even a removable part on the bottom of the tent bag that allows it to expand, so if you are having trouble fitting everything, you can remove that bit so that the bag is roomier. The vestibule area is also very nice. It's good for sitting in when there are mosquitos. The tent also goes up easily. It usually takes us 15 minutes or so to put up. The first time we ever put it up was our first time putting up any tent, we were complete beginner's, but even then we had it all set up nicely in less than 30 minutes. It's a pretty easy setup! It hasn't rained while using it so I can't say how water resistant it is, but so far it seems pretty good. Like I said, this is our first tent, so I don't have much to compare to, but I was surprised at how light it was. I imagine it's probably about average as far as weight goes.",,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHO6EZ7XGT2VZMTKQINRCPDQHIZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019YDV12O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R56LGBSQSIR0V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019YDV12O,B019YDV12O

It proved worthy of my list of camping staples while setting it up. If you are weighing the pros and cons, consider the following: PRO: 1. It is an incredibly easy and fast tent to pitch. There are hooks that snap onto the poles; the second camping trip we had it up (including rainfly) in 3-4 minutes. 2. The porch area is PERFECT for dogs and gear... i have two large dogs... but i bet i could fit 2-3 more in the porch area. 3. I'm 5'6"" and I can fully stand up in the center of the tent. 4. Great ventilation if you want it, otherwise it does stay cooler inside that outside in desert environments (humidity is a different animal all together). 5. Without the rainfly half of the back wall is completely mesh and helps move air around even if you have the door and windows closed. 6. Fits two large dogs and a queen sized air mattress inside CONS: 1. For some one used to lightweight everything, this 6 person tent weighs 19-20lbs... so it's definitely for car camping. 2. That back wall mesh adds a draft that during the colder seasons might make your head cold if you align your sleeping pad/mattress along it - i recommend using the opposite side with the door. 3. The bag it comes in is kind of flimsy (i'm reaching to come up with a 3rd con).",,14,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE5Z3XJ6R24E57S6KUT67EMUCUWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019YDV12O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YFE4QL8LVOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019YDV12O,B019YDV12O

It is very cool looking and can be set up/taken down by one person relatively easily. It really does fit back into its bag (with a little squishing effort), along with all the parts. The materials are typical quality for a tent at this price point. Expect to seal the seams if you use in wet environment. The corner zippered opening for a power cord was one of the selling features for me, but if nothing else gets seam-sealed, THIS spot should. Everyone who has mentioned this feature has said it leaks in the rain. Caveat emptor. Also, the vent pictured on the bottom rear for some versions is not present in the dark room version. Some have complained about that vent being a source for water getting into tent; others like the air it provides. YMMV. But if you like it really dark when you sleep, this is the tent for you. The walls and underside of the rainfly are very opaque, and the rainfly extends a tad lower on this model than the other ones--another selling point for me. Should you sleep with the rainfly off, it's very open and airy, but when buttoned up, it's extremely dark. I should mention that below where the tent wall and the bathtub-type floor meet, the flooring material that curves up is not as light occluding as the other material. So, in the day time, there's a band of light around the bottom (see picture). Could be a potential future modification with duct tape, but air mattress(es) would likely cover most of that. However, that raises another issue. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is NOT a tent for 4 people. Only 2 adults max, and they would have to be pretty friendly. In the picture of the inside, there's a 3X6 foot pad on the floor that takes up a bit less than half the 9X7 foot floor space. Another pad/air mattress will fit with a bit of room in between them, but whoever is sleeping on the right side will be partially blocking the zipper for the D-door. So, you cannot fit 2 high air mattresses or cot beds and still have access to the door. You'll also be touching the tent walls while lying down this way on any pad or mattress higher than about 4-6 inches. A solo camper or a couple could put their *one* larger bed sideways and still fit in the tent, but for a couple, the person sleeping on the back side will likely disturb their partner to get out of tent. For these reasons, for 2 adults the 6-person or larger tent is probably a better option. This handy 106"" X 83"" footprint tarp is the best fit for a ground cloth for the 4-person tent (which should not extend beyond the edges of your tent--a common camper mistake): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JGC66XL/ref=asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1 It even comes in its own stuff sack, which you can stuff into the tent bag. UPDATE: Have now camped out in this tent, and the very first night it rained off and on all night. Not a drop in the tent, though, even with a power cord coming through the zippered access point for it (albeit, with it zipped snugly against the cord, not left wide open). The tent fabric is also so dark that you can hardly see a lamp on inside the tent from outside. The privacy that affords is appreciated. Update #2 (7/2019): Have camped out in this tent several times now and it continues to perform well. It does flex a lot under windy conditions, but it held up fine. Make sure you properly stake out ALL the guy lines. One odd thing we noticed was that the lime-green rainfly seemed to attract a lot of small flying bugs! They just hung out on it, but did not get into tent, so no big deal.",,7,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHFTZ3BCDWPNMB3PTX5JD5CDST4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019YDV12O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15S6EIRTVQ953/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019YDV12O,B019YDV12O

As a bonus, I absolutely love the oversized screen window / roof panel that allows for a great view of the sky at night. Basically 1/4 of the roof. Now, obviously you have to choose between that OR darkness in the morning, can’t have both (the rain fly, if installed, covers this window and keeps it very dark inside). The porch was also useful to keep mud out of the main tent and a good place to leave shoes etc I don’t know how I’ve done without a porch on other tents! On my first trip it rained pretty heavy one night. The porch had some water as expected. There was a little water inside the tent as well. Not a massive amount considering how much it rained. I’m going to spray it with some waterproofing spray and hope that will help but overall I think it held up fine for the conditions. We actually fit 3 full size Coleman cots in there (6’2”) that was just enough room for the cots with prob 6-8” between them and about same between the feet and the door. But pretty much nothing else (storage under the cots of course). But it was doable. Overall I am very happy with this tent and would recommend it. I bought the 4 person tent for myself or maybe 2 people occasionally.

The poles are impossible to tell apart unless you lay them fully extended side by side. So mark them with nail polish or paint. If you spend 5 minutes with a piece of cheap plastic and some binder clips you can cover the screen room in a rain storm. Clip the edge of the plastic to the rainfly and roll it up out of the way. If rain is expected, unroll a bit and clip to the front arch pole with some slack so you don't pull on the rain fly itself. You need large 2""-3"" binder clips to reach around the pole's diameter. Then spread out the plastic and attach it with medium or small binder clips to the existing ropes or the tent or spare pegs or anywhere else that makes sense. I think the people who are annoyed by the lack of privacy when the rainfly is off can fix that with a piece of cloth and a few clips. Or a folded up rainfly and a few clips. Use clips to attach something to cover the electric cord holes. I have never seen binder clips from an office supply store used by other campers.

The included instructions aren't as clear as they could be, be sure to set it up once at home before fending off bugs and the elements out on your trip. The screened in area is a good size for storing supplies and dirty shoes/gear, the rain fly looks a little unstable and simply rests on top the the main poles, stabilized by it's own shorter pole and ropes, but where it clips onto the corners of the tent feels poorly planned, the fly often slips to one side or the other of the tent poles and can look lop-sided. Have no fear though, it doe's its job well. The windows and ventilation are well designed, with the fly off on a warm clear night, the sky is beautiful while laying down. There is a mesh channel that separates the front screened in area from the main tent, allowing for moisture to travel under the tent rather than into it from the front portion. I found this both helpful and frustrating, I chose a yoga mat as a ""welcome"" mat that covered this area as the natural moisture from below was problematic.

DARKROOM: I was a little skeptical about how the “darkroom” feature would perform given some reviews, but I’m pleasantly surprised. It reduces light dramatically to the point that we could get our toddler to nap in it. No way that was happening In our regular tent. To expect “blackout” is pretty unreasonable given a tent needs air circulation. This probably goes without saying but use the rain fly to achieve the darkroom effect. 2. :ASSEMBLY: If you are familiar setting up a tent at all expect to set it up solo in about 5 minutes. No instruction was needed but it comes with them. With help it could go up under 3 minutes. Very simple design. 3. BUILD: We haven’t used the tent much but the poles feel well built as does the material. The rain fly doesn’t cover the tent entirely so some water can make its way in if you experience a downpour. Any tent I’ve owned that was full waterproof in any amount of rain were $300+ so I’m not disappointed with this fact. The tent packs small and light for its size. Overall great value for the price.

In our other tents, it would become extremely hot and bright by 6am. This tent allows you to sleep in just because you won’t be woken up right when the sun comes up (unless you open window). Love how dark and cool it remains throughout the day. I attached a photo of how dark it remains even at 2pm. Sturdiness & setup: the tent seems to be made of high quality materials and we feel very confident in the integrity of the tent. Feels very well constructed.

Even though we already had a tent, the sun was unbearable and we’d be woken up by 7 am due to the heat in the normal Coleman tent. The dark room technology is a game changer. We easily slept til 9/10 am with it and it was remarkably cooler inside. Last year, we used the dark room and covered the other tent in tarps- it was still so much cooler (and darker). We bought another dark room for this year and our regular Coleman is reserved for fall/spring camping trips.

I seam sealed and put 2 coats of waterproofer on we had a small rain with no issues. PROS- The dark room really helps with getting a better full night's sleep. In a campground you won't notice the headlights of the cars getting in late or leaving early. I got the front porch mesh option and loved the airflow with the inner door unzipped and all the screens that open make it a great hot weather tent. Fits a queen and a twin air mattress 3 adults can fit comfortably in the 4 person option. Like the faster easier clip to the pole attachments. Easy to add a tarp to cover the front porch. Love the cary bag has a tear away strip so the tent actually fits back in the bag. CONS- Cheap poles- plastic I think? (Will bend but not break so better than fiberglass)I Would love aluminum but that costs $$$. I hate pole sleaves (on all tents not just this one) even though there are only small sections at the very top and a longer but easy section on the porch.

As habit, I set up a new tent and spray with a can of water-proofing from the local sports store. This means my review does not exactly reflect out of the box ability. Many people mistake humidity accumulating on the inside of a tent as leaking inside, so I make an effort to have good ventilation. It was a very rainy and windy trip, but the rainfly allowed us to keep all the windows open for ventilation. The porch does not stay dry nor did I expect it to, but it has a mesh strip connecting between the tarp like floor of the porch and the entrance of the tent itself. It was easy just to lift the edge of the porch to make any accumulated water drain out of the porch. We stayed dry, while staying cool. No problems to report.

Our previous tent was of similar design, but without the vestibule and the Dark Room Tech. Even on a cloudy morning, at sunrise it was so bright inside that it was difficult to sleep. The Coleman Dark Room Tech is a big improvement in reducing the amount of light in the tent. It is not ""pitch dark"" in the tent. There is still quite a bit of light to clearly see in a backpack or even read, but it is not so bright to prevent you from remaining asleep. The entire back section is a screen window and the fly covers it and provides the darkness. While Coleman claims that the tent runs a few degrees cooler than conventional tents, I have no way of comparing it to my old tent. It may be a bit cooler inside, but to me it seemed to be more stuffy. I see the need for the fly to hug the tent and cover it lower to the ground, to block the light, but it also blocks some of the breeze that ventilates the tent. The vestibule is really nice to have. We placed our coolers there out of the sun, and it provided a clean place to take off or put on your shoes. It rained a day or two, some rain blew into the vestibule and puddled on the floor, but I could sit there without getting soaked. The living area of the tent remained totally dry even through hard rain and high winds. The instructions for assembling the tent consist of a set of simple drawings. They don’t show much detail, especially how the poles are oriented and attached to the tent by a tie at the top. During our first setup we noticed a piece of red tape on one of the pole ends and one of the plastic bottom receivers. That was our only indication that the poles were directional, as it is not indicated on the drawings. However, I must say that Coleman Customer Service is outstanding. I called them once before buying the tent and once after the first use for a defective strap. Both times they were friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable. They answered my questions and solved our warranty issue quickly and easily. All said, we are very happy with our purchase of the Coleman Carlsbad Fast Pitch Cabin Tent with Dark Room Technology.",,13,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AELRHLIN3UPMBK5KB2PN73CY4AFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B019YDV12O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Coleman,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGM2MR9881VUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B019YDV12O,B019YDV12O

The instructions that come with the tent are not for this tent. That being said, it is not difficult to set up, even for the inexperienced like my wife and I. 2. An earlier review that I had read mention that the screen porch door need to be nailed down someway so that it wasn't necessary to hold on to it to unzip.

The low mount is NOT a spacer to be added to the tall mount as some have commented.

Edited 11/25/19: I bought the inexpensive UTG Super Slim T1 lower one-third co-witness mount from Amazon and it works great with the Romeo5 sight. It gives a 1/3 co-witness. The front iron sight is very low in the bottom third of the sight picture, because the Romeo5 is a little tall to begin with, but I think the front fixed sight would be usable.

Ultimately decided a Red Dot would be a good starting point, and I can always by a magnified scope down the road. I zeroed this in, on my 50yd range. Keep in mind the MOA adjustments on this are 0.5.

That being said, I have a few observations already: Overall fit, finish and feel are fantastic, as expected from Sig. The front lens coating prevents using a red laser bore-sight to sight in...the lens coating is a notch filter somewhere in the 650nm range, which filters out specific wavelengths of light, so that the red-dot from this sight always pops out against any target (i.e. even a red one)...so, if you want to bore-sight it, you will need to use a green laser. I was able to do a rough bore-sighting in my garage in nearly pitch black with this sight on one of the lowest settings against the inside of my garage door, which is white. In just about any other environment, it would be impossible. I think the pros outweigh the cons on this feature, so I'm not really complaining...just a word of caution for someone looking to purchase a new bore sight...go ahead and upgrade to green...I wish I had! I think I will miss the cross hairs from my previous reflex sight, but I upgraded to this prism (tube) sight because I couldn't keep any reflex (open) sight that I used zeroed. The adjustment mechanism in most reflex sights adjust the mount, whereas this adjusts the internal light source (I believe), which should be easier to keep zeroed. Also, no set screw is needed and the detents/clickers on the adjustment screws provide solid tactile feedback so you know when you've made an adjustment. Also the adjuster caps double as a screwdriver, so no tools required to make field adjustments. Win. Lastly, the motion sensing feature is awesome...no more worrying about forgetting to turn off the sight and having a dead battery when you pull it out of the safe...it seems to have about a 2-minute turn-off delay if you set it down or remain motionless, and the slightest tap will fire it back up again. The only problem with this that I can see is if you keep it in your car, it would always be on while you are driving...so turning it off is still a good idea. My only complaint is that it doesn't have flip-up lens caps...the bikini caps protect well, but aren't really convenient, and have to be aligned to a specific clocking to seat properly.",,2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEUEC3X5HYMX3NYZR5V3IPJ3YSTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01C95I8N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Sig Sauer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30Z6BEM455KRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01C95I8N4,B01C95I8N4

I got it after seeing a Youtube video where it was put through extensive abuse - dropped onto various hard surfaces, submerged, frozen, even shot with a shotgun - and not only survived but continued to work. At the range, the automatic brightness of the dot was fine. It did halo a bit - but I believe that's due to the peculiarities of my vision and astigmatism. Windage was pretty much on but it did shoot very low at 7-10 yards. I was surprised at how much elevation I had to crank in to bring it up - more than 2 full revolutions. Once it was in, though, it delivered very good groups if I did my part - but then, that's always the catch, isn't it? Again, the elevation may be due to me - the way I hold, etc. Adjustments were easy with the turret caps set up to make them so you don't even need a screwdriver. The Holosun 507c I recently put on a pistol gave me the exact same problem with elevation. Pros - the durability, the 2 MOA dot, the brightness, the MOTAC auto on/off feature, the ease of adjustment. Cons - not really a con but it would be nice if it had a QD mount. I mounted a pair of Magpul BUIS and they co-witness fine but if you have to use them, it's always nice to get the red dot completely out of the way.

The Holosun units are a great alternative to Aimpoint, and typically come in a little under $200. The Aimpoints are significantly more expensive. Generally speaking, the Aimpoints are a tad bit clearer and the dot is a bit sharper, but I can buy two Holosun units for the price of the cheapest Aimpoint. Then I come across this Sig Romeo for a tad over $100. Looks cool, has the long battery life like the others I mentioned, so I grabbed one. Turns out, this sight is incredible for the money. It’s on par with the newer Holosuns in terms of glass clarity and very close to Aimpoint clarity. No tint to the glass, dot is crisp, etc. Comparing all the parts/finshes, the packaging and everything else, I have a strong feeling these sights are manufactured by Holosun to Sig’s specifications...which is a good thing, in my opinion. To get anything even a little bit better than this Sig Romeo5 site, I would have to buy an Aimpoint at roughly four times the cost...and ultimately I would end up with a sight that I’d guess is only 10-15% better in terms of clarity. For my money, I just can’t see the benefit of spending $450+ on a non magnified optic, when I get 85-90% of the performance for 1/4 the cost. As far as other $100~ red dots go, I’ve tried a number of them over the years and not one of them was good enough to keep. The Vortex Sparc is one of them that’s popular, but I thought it was total garbage (short battery life, tinted glass, cheap looking finish, slightly fuzzy dot) and I paid $199 for it. Anyways - for my money, it’s going to be Holosun or Sig Sauer Romeo Red Dots from now on. Aimpoint makes a great sight and I enjoy the two I own, but with Holosun and Sig as tried and true, proven alternatives, I can’t justify the added cost any longer.",,7,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHLVAGPQ2P3YZTKZ7UI4IX226UJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01C95I8N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Sig Sauer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN66W1IXQ73UP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01C95I8N4,B01C95I8N4

Cruz,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"September 01, 2021",United States,Looks good to me,"So first, I purchased this red dot because it was cheap. I have an AK that ive shot maybe twice for a total of 20-30 rounds. My plan was to put an optic on it so I could run for a while since I got a ton of 762x39. I have a number of holosuns and wanted something different and didn’t feel like breaking the bank on an Aimpoint so the Romeo 5 fit the bill. I took it to the range and was having issues matching up the sights with the red dot and still hitting zero when I noticed the sights on my AK are slightly canted making my groups hit about 8 inches to the left of the point of aim at 100 yards. Of course Arsenal doesn’t want to own up to it without me paying to ship it and fix it. I told them no thanks. Since then I’ve run maybe 1200 rounds through it and bypass the iron sights. No POI shift, flickering or anything. Last weekend I put it on a Stribog and once again it worked fine. I’ve hd it a few months now and have not turned it off. I keep it set around the mid brightness level. What I really like about this optic is that it comes with two mounts. So far I’ve been running the low mount exclusively but it’s nice to know I have the tall one as well in case I run it on something else. As for the negatives… I don’t find it particularly attractive as the logo is a little on the large size. In addition the front lense is very reflective which gives the optic just a little bit of tint. It’s not a huge issue but at dusk it is a bit darker than a holosun or T1. Otherwise I think think this optic is a great value for what it is. I don’t anticipate taking this thing into battle anywhere so I don’t need something crazy durable as it’s durable enough with me bumping it around when I run drills.

Good nonetheless.,"I recently took the plunge from ""budget"" (see 30 dollar Chinese made ""red dots"") to these ""entry level"" (still Chinese made, unfortunately) red dots. I have 2 holosun 403bs and now a Sig Romeo 5. I like the Sig slightly more but both models are vastly superior to the 30 dollar sights I was using. Pros for the Sig.. I like that the MOTAC cuts the sight off after 120 seconds. VS 1 hour for Holosun (on it's lowest setting). The dot on the Sig seems more precise to me even in bright settings. It's by a slim margin, but it does appear more defined and concise to me (which should obviously translate into better shot placement). CONS. Even with the MOTAC cutting the sight off much sooner than Holosun, SIG claims a 10000 hour inferior runtime, but that still translates into 4 and a half years of constant runtime. The SIG weighs about an ounce more. They both fluctuate price some but right now I'm able to get the Holosun for about 15 bucks less.

I could have bought a less expensive red dot, but for the value, this is the best RDS on the market. It's durable, accurate, holds a mean zero, the red dot is extremely crisp at various brightness levels and the auto on/off function is worth it's weight in gold. Plus, a lifetime warranty from Sig Sauer....come on. I've absolutely put my Romeo through the perverbial ringer with water, weather, rounds and overall poor handling on my part. It sits in my truck with no constraint and has the marks to prove it, but I've never had to re-sight for zero, it just keeps driving tacks wherever I put the red dot. If you're considering a RDS that has functionality and durability well beyond what you pay for (value) this is definitely the RDS for you.

No need to turn it off, it will auto shut down. If so much as a fly farts on it, its instantly back on at the brightness you left it.

B01C95I8N4,"Sig Sauer SOR52001 Romeo5 1x20mm Compact 2 Moa Red Dot Sight, Black",4.8,1351,Mark W.,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"October 13, 2021",United States,Incorrect information in some reveiws!,"I received this in the factory sealed box, and with the factory tamper proof seal in tact! The sight came boxed with the, Mounting key, Lens cloth, Battery, 2 mounts, lens cap, Instruction Sheet. This is a very nice sight, easy to mount, clear optics. Clearing up the misinformation about this sight. A few things that's important to know about the optic! (1) Read over the instruction sheet, don't just think you've had these types of sights before and you know how this one works and end up leaving bad reviews. (2) Yes! the sight has an auto off after 120 seconds of ""No Motion"" and auto motion ON so, yes if it stored in a vehicle the motion of it will keep the red dot illuminated and cause an unnecessary battery drain. If you've read the instruction sheet it informs you that the sight also an actual Power Off and Power On option, to use this option you only have to hold down on either the + or - button longer than 1 second, and the same thing to power it back on. (3) reports of the sight not working in MOST cases is caused from one of couple of things, when you first install the battery you will not be able to see the red dot until you turn up the brightness, so click the + button (Don't Hold It Down At First, Just Click It) 3 or 4 times if you still don't see the dot assume the sight is in its Powered Off Mode and push and hold either the + or the - button for 1-Second to actually turn the sight on, then click the + (plus) button a few times until the dot becomes bright enough to see. (4) Another possible problem that could happen is with installing the battery, mine had a safety peel off sticker that HAS to be removed, well due to certain conditions when you peel these off it leaves adhesive (glue) on the battery so its possible to leave enough as to cause a loss of battery contact. Make sure when you peel the sticker off from the battery that all the adhesive is cleaned off of the battery itself. _______________________________________________________________________ !Caution! the brightness adjustments in either direction ISN'T A PUSH & HOLD operation!!!!! its momentary CLICKS! That means that the brightness setting isn't a constant veritable, its in CLICKED STEPS! !Caution! holding down for more than one second on either the Plus or the Minus button actually turns the optic sight OFF (totally powering it down) meaning that just clicking the brightness buttons (Plus or Minus) will not do anything until the optic sight is ""Turned Back On"" Bottom line on the misinformation of this optic, its has some higher level electronics then the standard red dots, its not rocket science to understand, but its cause for a lot of these being returned and the reason for a lot of the low rated reviews. Its NOT only ""Auto Powered Controlled"" it can be Turned Off, and it can be done so by accident. PLEASE read over the instruction sheet FIRST before you box this sight up and return it, its quality enough to deserve that much attention. Bottom line on the optic sight itself. Let me make this clear! This review is from a 64 year old AR-15 (5.56 NATO) gun owner!! The sight responded well to adjustments! Seems to be holding ZERO very well with what ammo I've fired so far! It has very clear optics! Having the turret adjusting bits built onto the turret caps works very well! There is no issues with the quality or function of this sight that I can find, but I'm thinking that the same sight upgraded to the larger tube and lenses might be NICE! but it would be larger and it cost more! Very Nice for the money!",,6,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEVBUJXDE4BR2RHKQWSZG4PVVXNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01C95I8N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Sig Sauer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21NL8IKZE5QZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01C95I8N4,B01C95I8N4

You can see dozens of similar models on Amazon. They are knock-offs of the Harris bipod but cost 70-80% less. Corners are cut to get to that price. Is it junk? It depends on what you use it for. I put in on a .22 rimfire rifle and it works FANTASTIC. I moved it to an M&P 15 AR15 and it works - but it was a bit of a hassle getting an acceptable adapter to hook it up to the hand guard. Not CVLife's fault. It comes with picatinny rail adapter but I haven't tested that. What's wrong with it? It's cheap. I mean it's not built robustly and i would expect you'd have trouble on rifles with a bigger recoil than an AR15 in .223. The screw that holds the bipod in place doesn't look like it would hold tight but it hasn't worked loose at all when I shoot with my .22 rimfire. I haven't used it as much on the AR15 but I test the tightness every magazine and it has stayed tight so far. Once I get another bipod I'll be able to leave this one on the AR15 for keeps and I'll put a dab of lock-tite on it to make sure it doesn't work loose. Yes, I like this well enough that I'm buying another one from CVLife. Installation might confuse you - watch a youtube video and you'll say ""OH, OF COURSE - THAT'S SIMPLE"" and it is simple, once you've seen it done. That would be for installation on a standard swivel attachment. If you're installing on an AR15 with the round Colt style hard guard you'll need an adapter. Trust Me. Spend a few bucks extra and get the Harris adapter (#5). It costs twice as much as the junk adapters you see online but it doesn't fall apart from something as simple as folding the legs of the bipod. The reason I say this is one-step-above-barebones is that you can adjust the length of the legs. Very handy, you'll need a lot of extension to keep the banana magazines of the AR15 from bumping the ground. If you haven't used a bipod before be prepared for a shocking increase in accuracy.

This is a good bipod. It does come without instructions, but the assembly is pretty straight forward, thanks to the several reviews on this site that describes what you need to do to attach it to your rifle. Two points that helped me the most were to put the Allen wrench, supplied in the kit, inside the picatinny adapter so that the attachment post stays out of the adapter. The other main point is to turn the adjustment knob, under the bipod, so that the attachment pins are raised up out of the body of the bipod. This helps to separate the pins far enough to fit into the attachment post of the adapter. The bipod is well made, and the legs work well. I have a Ruger AR 556, and was able to attach a Magpul picatinny rail to the original handguard.

Win-win. The Bipod didn't come with directions but the directions were posted on the amazon page as the last picture you can look at regarding the product and I saved it to my computer and used them to attach the bipod to my bolt-action rifle. Basically just unscrew the big screw till it's loose but still attached and push the two swivel connectors (that will end up attaching to your rifle's sling swivel) through the hole (remove the piece of plastic that connects the two swivel connectors) then with your fingers apply some pressure and keep them apart so they don't fall back through the hole again. Then line them up on each side of the sling swivel and start tightening up that big screw again. It will draw those swivel connectors in toward the rifle sling swivel and also brings up the bipod towards the rifle's stock. Make sure you get your fingers out of the way as you're tightening it up. Turn the screw till it can't turn anymore and your bipod should be attached fully.,,1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFO6VBJBZZR7SEQKRSS6J37MJCCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E4YVCOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,CVLIFE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKLXH7TORV0ES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01E4YVCOA,B01E4YVCOA

I use this for benchrest shooting with .22lr and .223/.556 and it does the job just fine. I'm not going into combat with it. Here's something else to think about: the CVlife guys actually stand behind the product. One of the small tabs that secure it to the sling stud came off. I contacted the company to see if I could get just the replacement part, and they ended up sending me an entire brand new Bipod! No drama. You really can't ask for more than that at this price!

It's almost a clone of a higher end product that costs over $100. For the price and features, this product can't be beat. I'm using this on a heavy barrel Voquartsen 22 LR (Ruger 10/22) with a heavy stainless steel barrel. What's great? This is easy to attach and comes with a rail adapter. I recommend mounting direct to your sling mount or buying a MLok sling mount to reduce the height. It's sturdy without being too heavy. I had no problem mounting this. I highly recommend watching the Twang and Bang video for some tips on making it more secure. I made a small drill indentation where the tension screw contacts the base plate, added a drop of blue Loktite, and added the zip tie as he recommended. The legs snap firmly into place. The biggest advantage is how the legs deploy. You can pull them out and they lock into one of the cut out leg rings. No more messing with spring legs and a tension screw trying to get the legs even. To retract, just push the button and push in. Note, I also recommend mounting the legs facing forward when collapsed. This lets you lean into the bipod when shooting without collapsing the legs. Why this isn't a $100 bipod: This does not have a front swivel for fine adjustments. If you are doing any precision shooting, you are going to want to buy the UTG or a premium bipod. Even the model this clones doesn't have the fine adjustment to level out your rifle. That being said, I'm shooting a 22 LR at 200 yards with this bipod and getting sub 2"" groups. I would not recommend putting this on a lightweight rifle. There are some basic, ultralight bipods that are better for that usage. This is much better for tactical or target rifles. Also, I don't know if I'd want the added weight on a hunting rifle since I shoot offhand almost exclusively. If I was bench hunting or maybe out west, then this would be a good option. The legs are long enough for my, but check to see what you need for your shooting bench. I use additional sand bags as a base if I need to get up to shoulder height. Overall, I couldn't be happier. This was a significant step up from other bipods I've used, and is actually cheaper. I'm now considering ordering more for other rifles.",,11,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEL7VXEKS2SPMYCCUB322DNXGHRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01E4YVCOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,CVLIFE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VL1KNFIELGM1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01E4YVCOA,B01E4YVCOA

After owning half a dozen Harris bipods over the years, I decided I didn't need to go fancy on my six-hundred dollar Remington 700 project rifle. The finish on the legs looks good, the buttons that release the spring-loaded legs have an affirmative feel, and the rubber feet are soft-enough so as not to mar whatever you're resting on. I will say that I ordered an inexpensive carbon fiber bipod the same time as this steel and aluminum one (only the tubes are really carbon fiber).

Good product and great price.,"Excellent product. There is absolutely no reason I can see to spend the amount of money that companies like Harris want for a simple bipod set, when you have plenty of reasonably priced options that work just as well right here on Amazon. I bought this for my cousin's Savage .22 and its perfect for it. No functional problems to speak of at all to date. The springs that maintain the tension on each of the legs (to move them from their ""up"" position under the rifle barrel to their ""open/deployed"" position) are admittedly quite taut which can make their deployment a little loud if you do not maintain control of them as you bring them down, but I don't find that to be a detrimental failure by any means. The telescoping legs are easy to deploy and put away. Mounts easily to the forward sling swivel OR a rail because it comes with parts for either option... Overall this set does its job and does it well.

Mine did not come with instructions, so if you are reading this, be sure to read further, and look at the pictures in the product photos for the two pages of instructions. If you know your way around mounts, then this is a straightforward installation. If this is your first time, then the bipod has jaws if your firearm has a mounting point for this bipod. Take a look at the rail adapter for the piece you should look for. If you do not have this mounting point and only have a bare rail, then you can use the included adapter to attach the bipod to the rail adapter. The bipod comes with a 'hose piece' placed between the jaws, and the only way to remove it is to loosen the adjuster on the bottom to allow the jaws to move forward to get the hose off. If you have the bipod adapter, then just get the jaws inbetween the holes and tighten. If not, use the adapter, and then rail mount it. Overall, the bipod works just fine. The feet are spring loaded with a tiny spring and they can be positioned at different heights. There are specific increments for the feet position, so if you are on uneven ground, you may not be level. Couple this with there not being any side to side movement, leads me to believe that it would work really well on a benchtop or other similar flat surface, but not as well in the field. It is certainly better than nothing at all though. My only fear is that the tightening screw (the one to tighten the bipod down to the firearm or the rail adapter) may strip at some point, as the threads seem pretty fine, and that the piece holding it on, I could not tell exactly what it is threading into. See pictures for what I mean. While nothing has happened to mine, I will see over time what happens. I plan on using a bunch of thread locker to make sure everything stays where I have it. The rail adapter is robust, and overall the finish is pretty decent for everything. For the cost though, I am happy with putting it on one of my inexpensive firearms.

B01HPWATOC,Feyachi Reflex Sight - Adjustable Reticle (4 Styles) Both Red and Green in one Sight!,4.3,1011,Ian Paul Freely,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"May 10, 2021",United States,Great quality for the price,"If you're looking for a simple reflex site for a good deal and not sacrifice quality, this is it. I must say I was impressed with the materials/durability. I think the company selling these has gone through some changes, because some of the negative reviews I've seen had pics that the packaging and other things looked different. The packaging was great, with sturdy foam to keep it tight. It came with 2 batteries, a microfiber cloth, and 2 allen keys for adjusting. Super easy to mount, made for picatinny rail. There are red and green sights with several brightness levels, with crisp reticles. Just remember this is a reflex site and not meant to be a scope; so if it seems blurry, try keeping both eyes open and focus on your target and not the reticle itself. On the sight I received, the dial for adjusting the reticle would not turn. I didn't want to void any warranty, so I contacted the seller. They sent a brand new one out and did not even want the old one returned. The new one worked perfectly! Even better, I was able to (mostly) repair the old one and may try to use it still. I think some of the ultra powerful adhesive they use in assembly may have gotten on the bottom of the dial.

However, having used it twice now, and fired at least a few hundred 9mm rounds while using it, I can honestly say that I am, so far, perfectly satisfied with its performance. I had to initially zero it at very close range (approx. 15'); but, once that was done, I moved back to 50' and it held a near perfect zero. All the adjustments (windage and elevation) held tight and worked as they were intended. Be sure to keep the mounting screws secure, and I'm fairly certain you will be pleased with this product. BTW, I am also using the Fireclub Universal scope mount, so my scope is not directly attached to my HK frame. It also is just high enough so that I can co-witness below the sight. I'm happy at about a tenth the cost of most other similar sights. OK, now, a few weeks later and a few more range outings; I continue to feel that this sight is a good value. I do have one new negative comment however, and that is that it is not holding the zero from one outing to the next. That is not necessarily a big deal as I am only doing casual range shooting; and it doesn't take that long to re-zero. However, I also have a slide mounted sight on another pistol and it never needs to be rezeroed; but then again, it cost well over 10X as much as this Feyachi....",,22,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGY54PD4VVX7MHXZPAHVMM6SZQPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01HPWATOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Feyachi,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EJDGL1J4TD38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01HPWATOC,B01HPWATOC

It comes in a very nice box, with a nice plastic cover for the sight itself I promptly lost within a day, every wrench it needs, a microfiber cloth, and a basic manual.

It took a little fiddling to get the elevation zeroed in because the barrel is pretty far below the scope (about 4.75 inches). I can now hit a small target with precision from 50ft, I haven't tested it out on 50-150ft range yet which is where I will be using it most. Pros: Price, It actually doesn't feel cheap when taking it out of the box. It was nicely packaged and came with everything you need to put it to good use and take care of it. The variable brightness of the reticules really helps. The different reticules all look good. I can't wait to use this in a close to mid range airsoft game!

It comes packaged securely in a nice box that is filled with a good dense foam with cutouts that hold the product very securely. In the box were both keys needed to fit and secure the sight to my gun as well as not only one but two batteries so that is a major plus. It also came with a little rag for cleaning the optic which again is a major plus. As soon as it came out of the box it was very easy to tell that it was very well constructed. To be honest I was actually surprised by how nice this little thing was for the price. I did not expect to receive such a quality item for amount they are charging. It also only got better from there. installation was extremely easy and straightforward. As soon as you put in the battery and turn it on its a pleasure to look through and see one of the 4 optics you decide to use. The red dot is my favorite and the others are just as good to be honest. They give you the option of a crosshair, a circle dot, a dot and another style which I am not fond of but I am sure some will find to be to there liking. It gives you the ability to not only change between those 4 sights but also between red and green color which is really pretty dang cool. On top of that you can change the brightness of the optic and color all on the same dial simply by spinning it. As you spin it it stays firmly where you put it. There is no loose parts or questioning what you have set. It feels very firm and well put together. Zeroing took all of five minutes at most. It is incredibly simple, fire a shot and adjust the zero with the provided wrench until your shots are hitting the center of the optic. It really couldn't be any easier.

B01HPWATOC,Feyachi Reflex Sight - Adjustable Reticle (4 Styles) Both Red and Green in one Sight!,4.3,1011,marie,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"April 03, 2021",United States,Best deal in years!,"I have owned high end target optics for target shooting my whole life. Not expecting much I purchased 2 of these reflex sights for the kid's Nerf rifles. I was expecting extreme cheapness, but this Reflex sight is unbelievably well made for the money!! I can't find an area where they cut corners. The product comes very well packaged with instructions, 2 spare batteries, 2 Allen keys (for scope attachment and aim adjusting), soft plastic removable lens cover for storage, and even a cleaning cloth!!!! 95% metal construction. Only the back projector cover is made from dense plastic. Not sure what the lens is made of, but it is crystal clear. This reflex sight is cheaper than the toy plastic Nerf product!! I am sincerely stunned they are so cheap. In my opinion, you are getting a $100+ sight for less than 30%. Just don't go putting it on your $800 rifle that you also run junk ammo through, m'kay! Although it is unreasonable to try and find fault with such a bargain, two things that I would change are: 1.Turning the device off involves rotating the color/brightness wheel to a specific setting (R or G). I initially instinctively thought that the tiny red-dot setting at the back of the scope was the 'OFF"" setting.

B01HPWATOC,Feyachi Reflex Sight - Adjustable Reticle (4 Styles) Both Red and Green in one Sight!,4.3,1011,Jacob C. Decker,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"May 28, 2020",United States,I've bought 4 and used them to replace some that were 3 times the cost.,"These little reflex sights are great on an airsoft gun. Especially on a pistol or smg where you want fast target acquisition and a wide-angle of view or both eyes open (know your dominant eye) etc. I put them on TM-mark23 and Novritch SSX-23, and they work great. Sadly the Novritch red dots are far too small and dim to use like this I have found, and those were like 3x the cost. These little reflex sights have a paralax wiggle unlike a red dot. Where a tubed red dot sort of forces your eye to the barrel position, the reflex sights let you have the pistol further away, and in a duck hunt style action grip. Let's be honest, you aren't always playing airsoft and holding the pistol like you would at target practice, sometimes you're laying in a ditch and peaking your head up, this type of sight makes that easier. So it will feel a bit funky, but after a few games you'll really like it.",,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE7CWSDOA35EDTIB247FM6SMMTSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01HPWATOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Feyachi,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EQHG1YVRZBSR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01HPWATOC,B01HPWATOC

It's a weird sight picture if you use it to sight through as a sharp shooting sight. That is not its purpose, anyway. But with both eyes open, and the sight held out in front of your dominant eye, you see the reticle perfectly for a very quick target acquisition. I have not sighted it in yet, so I can't speak completely to its accuracy. I'm using it on a stinger ar6 pistol crossbow and it has made a nice group of about 5""just snapping off shots. Just shooting low and to the right. I'm waiting to sight it in correctly until I upgrade the limbs. It comes with a scope cloth and also a little plastic lens cover to keep it clean and scratch free. It's cheap enough to use for paintball or airsoft or on a little tactical crossbow, as well as any firearm where you're mainly concerned with quick BMC shots on multiple targets.

Wright,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"January 05, 2021",United States,A Must For Astrophotography With DSLR Cameras & Long Lenses,"It can be really tough trying to initially align a camera and lens on a deep space object under the night sky, especially faint objects that are tough to see in the first place. Trying to find the object either through the viewfinder and/or live view can be a challenge at best. That's where this red dot really shines, literally. Once securely mounted on the camera, and calibrated so the lens and red dot align on a distant object, the initial alignment on a deep space object becomes a lot easier. Two things to keep in mind: 1) Don't forget to order the accompanying hot shoe mount to attach the red dot to the camera (it does not come with the red dot), and; 2) Use the two small set screws that are already in the accompanying mount to secure it to the camera hot shoe so it does move around (there's a fair amount of play between the hot shoe and mount you'll want to eliminate). This red dot has become my new best friend for deep space astrophotography using a DSLR and long lens (I have a Nikkor 200-500mm f5.6 lens mounted to either a D850 or D500).",,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE4H35TLQWL3PAZ74YDFJ5Z6JXUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01HPWATOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Feyachi,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LD14LN2QTG3Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01HPWATOC,B01HPWATOC

UPDATED- 4th time ! This may be a Winner!,"This is my third attempt at wanting this to work! I read the reviews and thought the product looked cool, and that it does, BUT! The 1st Feyachi showed a kaleidoscope refraction like you see in my mock up. Amazon graciously took it back. I ordered a second one from a different company a lesser price, ($19.00), and got the same type of a distorted mess! Amazon graciously took that one back too. So I ordered this one again hoping it to all be just a fluke...WRONG! Same mess! Didn't matter what pattern I switched to, or what color, both red and green gave me the same distorted results. A note: I noticed if I was outside, in bright light, the refraction's weren't as noticeable, but they were still there. When I turned to a shaded area, the refraction's came back with glaring results. Is it me? My eyes... I just came back from the eye doctor today and had a full blown exam done... The doctor said my vision, peripheral vision and every aspect of my eyes was ""BETTER THAN MOST"" my age... ""Nothing wrong with your eyes at all Mike!"" So I'm really lead to believe, these lower end red dot sights are the left overs from the higher end manufacturers. Maybe one will work for you? Hope this helps. -Mike UPDATE #4... Before I took this return to Kohl's, I made a trip out to Bass Pro Shop just to compare this Red Dot to the big box store stuff... Had the attendant show me the $229.00 Red Dot and when I looked through it... I saw THE SAME TYPE OF MESS I WAS SEEING in the Red Dot I was going to send back to Amazon! I asked the clerk how they can sell stuff like this? He looked in it and said, ""Like what?""... I asked him if he see's the blurry star pattern? He said ""Nope, just a dot."" (What the???) I took it back from him and looked, and there was the blurry star. Asked to see another one... SAME BLURRY MESS! We went through a couple more and they were all the same, to me a mess, to the attendant, a crisp clean dot! Then he said he heard a couple guys talking a few weeks ago and the one guy said he couldn't use the Red Dot because he had astigmatism. (Now remember, I just came from the eye doctor that day and the doctor said nothing about astigmatism, whatever that is/was.) So instead of going to Kohl's, I went home thinking I had some research to do. Got home and the neighbor was on the front porch so I asked him what he saw looking through it and he said... ""A little red dot."" ""What! Are you crazy! Don't you see any blurry, star like effects?"" Then he said...""Well, maybe a little, but I've got astigmatism!""... I looked on the web and studied up on astigmatism. Then found on one of Feyachi's description's, that the reflex sight will not work with astigmatism's! Next day, Wednesday, I took it out to the range and... At the 25 yard target, it looked like a... RED DOT! I must be going nuts! Got the .22 zeroed in to 2 inch groupings! Got back home and looked through the red dot and the star burst was back! Didn't panic though and was going to do one more trip to the range then return it... So Thursday went back to the range and at 25 yrds, there it was, a little red dot! Was able to tighten the group to 1"" before the rain came. SO... At this point I'm not returning the Feyachi Red Dot. I will be out at the range multiple times before the return window closes just in case something else happens. But at this point, this thing is a winner! I'll post one more update after this and let you know the results. Oh! And the other two pictures... The pict with the red arrow... Look what popped it's beady eyes over the hill while I was shooting! I stopped shooting and now wondered if I was hallucinating? Seeing red dots, then green dots, then deer while target practicing in the background? I'm losing my mind! Then the stinkin' thing had the gall to taunt me as it waltzed over to the 100 yrd targets! I give up!

Personally I have some mild astigmatism in my left eye ( Left: PWR +0.00/-1.25x180 ; Right: PWR -1.50 ) but that doesn't seem to give me any issues with blurriness when using this scope both eyes open. I have noticed that the scope is blurry in enclosed spaces (as I assume the focus point of the dot is around 25yd), but turning down the brightness fixes that for the most part. At further distances I can see the dot crisp and clearly, whether I have one or both eyes open. The dot itself has worked fine for me after about 800 rounds through my Ruger 10/22. I've had a lot of fun using it to plink at the range, and can see the dot just fine in the daylight at max brightness. I will say this dot has some noticeable parallax at closer ranges (the dot seems to move if you move your head), but at 25-100yd the dot appears fixed in space. The sight feels real solid, and as an added bonus I can still use the factory lock on my gun with the sight on. I'm a novice shooter so take my accuracy with a grain of salt, but I've managed to get 3 inch groups at 50yd with this sight. Not sure how that holds up to other shooters but it's acceptable for me.

So much so I ordered a second one. I had never used a reflex site before and really took to this quickly. I couldn't imagine how it could be any different than a traditional red dot. However, my target acquisition times went way down without sacrificing accuracy. I am right-handed, but left-eye dominant. Thus, with a little bit of training I am better with this than any red dot or scope out to about 100 yards. Super long-range shots? Of course I would need a good scope. Any cons?

I ordered one of these last week, and while it was a bit of a lemon, the customer service was fantastic. The service was so good on getting me a free replacement, that here I am 10 days later w a new sight that worked right out of the box. I'll have it out to the range to zero tomorrow, but it already looks more than a great deal for the price. Some of the reticles are more blurry than others (I like the dot reticle best anyway, that's what the original CCO's had) but the brightness settings are fine. The lowest settings would be best for dusk/night and the brightest settings show up clearly in the bright daylight when you need them, but the middle brightness works in the daylight. I used the old principle that you should turn up the brightness until you can see the dot, and then back it off one, which worked. That had me at the third of five settings. Room to go down for night, and up for the brightest days. One thing I wasn't expecting but appreciate greatly, is that on one of my rifles, the HUD has a large enough field of view that my iron sights remain visible, greatly mitigating the fact that this sight doesn't have a quick detach. This has the potential (I'll know once I get to the range) to be nearly the quality and effectiveness of the CCO that hundred of thousands of troops have trusted their lives to, and costing 3% of the price. The bang for the buck seems to be unquestioned. One final suggestion to the manufacturer, the instructions could be a bit more thorough, let me know if you want any suggestions.",,149,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AECXVADVYCLQYSY5GX53QUN3PCZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01HPWATOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Feyachi,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSPJBG6HRYTDT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01HPWATOC,B01HPWATOC

It also came with the Allen wrench to install and adjust it, along with a set of batteries. Looked nice and packaged very nice. At this time I was thinking why would someone pack a cheap made sight this nice. I installed it on my gun, bore sighted it at 10 yds, moved out to 20 yds. Dead on at 20. Two days ago I had a major upset. My pistol fell over in my safe. I figured that the sight was probably shot from the hit that it took. A couple of shots from the back porch proved me wrong.

Visibly the optics are the same I would say the browning is slightly more visible dot but not nocibly. Quality detail are the same but browning clicks a little smoother when changing the dot but not noticibly. Only difference is the glass in the browning has some slick polish on it giving it some iridescent red blue and seems to be built in to the ring.

B01HPWATOC,Feyachi Reflex Sight - Adjustable Reticle (4 Styles) Both Red and Green in one Sight!,4.3,1011,John C.,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"July 08, 2018",United States,Obviously I like this sight,"There appears to be several sellers of this same sight under different names. This is the second one I’ve purchased and so far the cheapest. It’s packaged well and included two batteries. The installation on my Aviani Triumph 727 Competition Air Pistol was quick and easy using the Sun Optics USA Airgun Scope IZH 46 SM7900 Barrel Mount (see photo). I thought I would share one point of clarification. Some of the reviews seemed confused on the use of the small Allen wrench. The large Allen wrench is used to connect the sight to the mount. It is also used to adjust windage and elevation when zeroing the sight. The small Allen wrench is used to lock these adjustments. Out of the box, the lock adjustment is tight so it needs to be loosened before you begin the zeroing process. There is no marking on the sight but it is shown in the instruction pamphlet. Some people also were discouraged with their ability to make windage and elevation adjustments. I wonder if part of the problem could have been that the zeroing lock was tight and never loosened when they tried to zero the sight. My zeroing plan was to tighten the lock adjustment, shoot a group, loosen the lock adjustment, adjust windage and/or elevation, tighten the lock adjustment and repeat the rest of the sequence until the zeroing process is complete. Out of the box it was shooting low and a little left. I raised it up, then walked it right until it was on target. Positive clicks when adjusting. Easy Peasy! I shot a 20 pellets group (see photo, I pulled one a little right, my fault) and it kept tight enough to drive tacks. I’ll do a little fine tuning, but I’m pleased with the first group with this sight. I changed from red dot to green dot and the zero didn’t change. I don’t shoot the other reticles because they are too big for my old eyes. They cover more than the X ring. I have a stigmatism and there is a little flaring. For me the smaller the better. I couldn’t be more pleased with this inexpensive sight. I just installed two more on my 617 and 686 Pro.",,29,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGNIG6YX7BO5IT23MJJY25CQXQOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01HPWATOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Feyachi,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6ARWA1XW2QNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01HPWATOC,B01HPWATOC

I wanted a toaster that was going to be delivered in the next few days and was big enough for bagels at a decent price. Those were really my only requirements, except that I also did not want it to be red. (For some reason I always seem to find a lot of red kitchen decorations and appliances.) There was another toaster, similar to this one, that I had decided on but it was a little pricier and it was not going to ship fast enough so I chose this one instead. I don't regret it. This toaster has some good features: -The slots are nice and wide, definitely wide enough for bagels. In fact, there is also a bagel setting, which works great. Put the bagel into the slots with the outside facing in, and the inside will remain soft while the outside gets toasted. -The frozen setting is good, too. Although, I don't use it much because I don't like the idea of water dripping into the toaster. (I don't really know if that's what happens, admittedly.) The few times that I have used it, it works well. Frozen waffles come out nice and toasty. -It is very easy to clean. The tray comes out easily, wipe it clean and put it back in, the end. I have had no issues. -There is a cord control mechanism at the bottom of the toaster. I don't know exactly what to call it. You can tuck the cord into it so that it's neat and not dangling anywhere potentially dangerous. This was a surprise feature for me, which I like a lot because, although it is sometimes inevitable because everything nowadays is electric, I don't like cords all over the place where you can potentially snag or trip on them.

This is my 4th or 5th toaster in the past 30 days; started out with of the most expensive toasters thinking at that price it has to toast perfectly; WRONG. Not only did it not toast on both sides but the bread would get stuck when it popped up. On to the hunt for the best toaster and reading dozens and dozens of reviews. Who knew this was more work than purchasing a new car!!! All I want is my toast to toast evenly on both sides - it that so hard to do???? Think about it - it's a TOASTER; isn't that the whole idea of a toaster? Put bread in, little-heated elements inside the toaster light up and cook the toast for a short time and then pop up. So why do some toaster toast one side OK and the other side is toasted randomly (maybe the top OR bottom or just the side). Hmmm, makes me wonder what's going on in their quality control :-). Anyway, I found the perfect toaster and this is it!! Great price, toasts evenly on BOTH sides just the way a toaster should. Don't hesitate if you're looking for a toaster to do a good job; don't let the fact that because this toaster is relatively inexpensive it's not a good toaster because it is - it's the BEST toaster.

The evenness is good on one side of the bread and a bit less good on the other side in the other slot. Not a serious problem, though. It does bagels very nicely. The toaster comes with a small but well done user's guide. As per instructions in that booklet, when first unboxed, I put the toaster through about eight dry runs with nothing being toasted. That dissipated the metallic/chemical residue odor that's common with high-heat small appliances. At its first actual use with bread inside, there was no odor. My one complaint so far is the heat-setting adjustment knob. It's matte black with a ridged circumference. There is a small, slightly raised matte black indicator ridge on the knob that can be hard to see. The knob itself has no detentes and turns easily. That can make it easy to accidentally move it off your just-right setting and a bit fiddly to get back to where you want it.

The higher end toasters are certainly more attractive than this one, but I couldn't justify spending several times more on something that toasts bread. This toaster toasts my thin-sliced bread consistently - no uneven patches. The few times I have used the bagel and frozen setting, they also performed well. It has a bit of a flimsy feel to it - cheaper materials, lightweight, so I don't know how long it will last.

And yes it’s mostly plastic, with a few metal accents. And no, it’s not a heavy weight, if you can’t live without a toaster that weighs as much as your stove, this isn’t for you. What makes this different from other toasters in this price range is the the frozen, bagel and cancel buttons light up, so you can know what’s going on. Some toasters don’t have these lights, so you’re in the dark, so to speak. Another item that sets this apart for me was how well it toasted. With a frozen piece of thick bread, and the toaster set on 4 & the frozen feature selected, the toast came out nearly like charcoal. Our last toaster didn’t have a frozen option, and it would take going through on 6 to get the bread barely tan. If I wanted dry white bread, I could do that in the microwave. I love that this thing gets down to business and makes “toast” the first time! The stated dimensions for the slot width is 1 1/4” my measurements make it closer to 1 1/2”, which should be great for badges and buns. As to the odor from the coils, just follow the directions in the owners manual, the odor cooks off and disappears fairly quickly.

Five stars ***** for now, we'll see how the longevity portion goes. The material is a slick type of fabric, whether it's man-made or not, I don't know, with use comes wear, so that part is still in the unforeseeable future. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The stitching appears to be haphazardly sewn in a very jagged line, whatever that means. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The buckles are plastic, they 'appear to be' solid and 'should' last a while, but, you know how plastic is when it comes from 'you know where'. They are 1/4 inch at its thickest point, and 1/8th inch at its thinnest. The metal hook fastener that holds the strap onto the rifle is seemingly O.K., time will also tell what will happen. It does appear to be well-made, but sometimes metal from, 'you know where' is not made to standards. As far as comfort, I would have to give that a 3 star rating, *** it's not that comfortable because the sling is very narrow, about an inch. This rifle I will use this on is a Ruger 10/22 and it weighs 'about' 8 pounds or so, that is loaded with 30 rounds and it has a flashlight and a green laser on it. It also has a 3 pound .920 heavy bull barrel on it, which REALLY adds to the weight overall. I also have an after-market plastic stock, (Fab Defense) which is really about the same weight as the wooden stock it came with. All of this crap really adds to the overall weight, quite a bit... ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Really a GREAT price, but again, only if its made well, and we'll see about that in the long run... Five stars ***** for now... ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I tried to make it a single-point sling, but, really, to do that, you would have to place BOTH snap buckles in one ring, I have it that way right now just to see how that works, I have no place to try it out right now, so it'll just stay that way until I decide if its worth it or not, I think not, but, again, we'll see... Three stars, *** but, I have to say, it's not like they said it would be a single-point sling, but I bought it hoping that it might work out. So, maybe it'd be a five star rating ***** IF you want a two-point sling... ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ It got here in two days, it was packaged very well, and I didn't have any problems at all from the seller or USPS, things went good for a change. :) I don't plan on using this for anything in particular, mostly plinking, so the weight part is not a worry for me, your rifle may vary, of course and change the dynamics of what I have above...",,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFLTDJD3TCV7WQW3KZT5YU5BCRCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075QB4Z1Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,CVLIFE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RD41P45KM1PG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075QB4Z1Z,B075QB4Z1Z

Because of the size of the barrel obviously you’re not gonna have tight curls it is a little hard to not accidentally press the buttons because they’re right there where your hand is When curling your hair. I just have to be very careful not to press the buttons there’s two options if you don’t read the instruction you might not know (I didn’t at first). There’s a turbo and there’s an on and off the turbo means it’s super hot for hair you can’t really curl that well because they’re being stubborn I wouldn’t use that one for all my hair. The temperature is easy to change. The length of the cord is fine it’s decent not that long but not extremely short were you just keep unpluging it every time.

I don’t even know why, honestly, my stylist seems to be able to curl my hair just fine using a similar style iron with the same size barrel but I’m sure she could probably use corn on the cob and still get amazing results. I guess that’s why I pay her hella Club Penguin Coins so I can pretend to be an Instagram thot. Sometimes I have her curl my hair just so I can watch and study her hair wizardry fully aware I’m just going straight home afterwards, getting into my favourite eye-gouging, bright, neon-pink camo Snuggie™ to lay on my couch and binge-watch 90 Day Fiancé. Her skills curling my uncooperative hair had me pretty dang convinced she’d made some deal or contract with a very powerful hair demon. You ever seen Inuyasha before? She probably conjured up that same hair demon lady from the first season. Or so I had thought.. until I discovered this bad boy. I can curl my hair like nobody’s business, easy and damage-free. I didn’t even have to sell my soul to some weird anime chick with a fetish for snatching people’s hair. Idk it’s just all around great and easy to use, so much so that I’m thinking of putting up my very own hair-curling/lemonade stand, make myself a decent amount of Neopoints and maybe someday move on up to making the big Voxels.

I ordered the 1.5 inch barrel since I love the loose waves and I have mid-long length hair that I typically grow out. My hair is very fine so I originally used the 5 heat setting. It didn't do anything! So I changed it to 10 then 15 according to the box instructions for thin and normal hair. None of it worked. I thought maybe I just suck at curling hair like I have for years. I used my abandoned 0.5-1"" remington curling wand, that I'm not a fan of since it tapers down to size making really tight curls, to check if maybe my Chi thermal protection spray was interfering with the curls. It wasn't, the remington made perfect tight curls. Came back to read the reviews and some people mentioned the turbo option. I tried it one more time with it still set to 15 and the turbo option on. I'm not sure if increasing it makes turbo even hotter but it worked perfectly! The image shows the left curl which was the failed curl. The right curl is after using turbo.

My picture shows my straight fine hair on one side and the way it looks after one pass with this contraption. I am sold. It took maybe 10 minutes to get all of my hair through this tool on my first use (I have fine hair but I have A LOT of it). ZERO PRODUCT is in my hair in this picture.

NONE of them could get my hair to hold a curl without damaging my hair extensively for having to curl it multiple times and leave the heat on for a long time when doing so. And then once I got a curl, I would have to use so much hair spray that my hair became one unit of movement. AND even then, it would be flat by the end of the evening.

It takes a little practice to make sure the waves don't all line up around your head, but even if they do, all you have to do is change your part or pull half your hair back.

My hair is somewhat fine, but I have an average amount of it. The problem with my hair is that I've never colored it and so it has a lot of slip and is ""too healthy,"" to the point that it doesn't hold a curl. This waver (set on medium/low heat so I don't fry my hair) really works. I had the heat up too high at first and my hair definitely had a crispy smell to it. You really don't need the heat up as high as it will go. Speaking of which, the temperature control doesn't say the temp/low/med/high, so you just gotta wing it. That's really my only problem with it and it's not difficult to figure out. But anyway, this is the only hot tool I've used that kept wave in my hair all day and night. I gently tussle it and use hair spray when I'm done and it's perfect -- so much body for my naturally pin-straight, silky hair. Hold the hair section out from your head and use the wand vertically rather than horizontally, stagger where you start in relation to your scalp, use different sized hair sections, and use it in the same direction the whole time (as you switch sides, you might unknowingly flip it). All this helps give it a more natural, mermaid look and prevents a weird uniform wave all over your head, which is not a good look.

Immediately jumped on Amazon to purchase via her affiliate link. I mention this because the link helps the business and it doesn't cost more to purchase this way. Wow is all I can say. My hair now has a fresh summertime wave any time of the year. What makes me especially happy is this iron helps enhance all my hair's natural wave. As I've gotten older my hair has begun its wave. During the pandemic and less device grooming have noticed the wave has increased or is it I'm not dampening it with a blow-drier more often. Even with a lot of long hair, this iron requires very little time to produce its effect. I haven't needed to keep the iron on my hair longer than a few seconds. The wave adds volume and a youthful appearance without expensive trips to the salon. Also, adds variety to options. If needing a more sleek professional straight look do this. If, like most of the time need a little fun hair care this iron rocks. I've only been experimenting for a month. I find it is easy to use out of the box as far as creating waves easily that look amazing. I am still working on varying types of waves. Super wavy to less more subtle. Similar to my natural hair. Highly recommend this product if you want to have a regular option without the expense. The wave stays fill on all day, too. Easy to re-wave the next day to touch up. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💯",,1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGTMGTCCD2F45YP7J7TWBUEDFQYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07CSZBWGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Bed Head,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HU8KUL7H8G6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CSZBWGQ,B07CSZBWGQ

Lots of Volume and Definition!","Where has this been all my life? I don't normally bother to style my hair, but I thought I would give this a try because of all the great reviews. It works wonders! My thick hair is so difficult to work with when I use curling irons, and my wrists get tired. This styling tool is a much easier and faster alternative with comparable results. I can make the waves deep or light. When I brush it out, it gives my hair the volume I've always dreamed about - and it lasts for days! As you can see from all the user photos, your results will vary based on a number of factors: your hair texture, if your hair is wet, what products you use, how hard you hold down the clamp, how long you let it set for, and how many strands you are trying to style at once. Try changing these variables to find what works for you. For me, I found that the best results for my thick hair came from dry hair with no products, a two-handed clamp, and about 30 seconds per medium section. Troubleshooting Tips: * The dial for the temperature is too easy to change. I think that's why some of the critiques are saying it does nothing for them or fries their hair. I noticed that my fingers were wrapping around the dial and changing the setting during use. I wish it was digital and would have paid more for digital, but this works well enough. * Clamp down the hair with both hands for more definition. Keep the iron perpendicular to the hair (across it sideways). * The iron doesn't seem to open that wide. You've got to relax your hand completely for it to open. * The iron is larger than my other styling tools, so I sometimes have a tendency to get burns. You might want to use a heat glove for this product. Don't know if anyone will see this...but I hope it helps someone! :)",,2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AELSRB6WOISNKEGTH4QWLACPF3CA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07CSZBWGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Bed Head,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAG34QU6HUEFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07CSZBWGQ,B07CSZBWGQ

Always have! For me, perms are very damaging so this wave iron has been a dream come true! Using a regular curling iron, you pull the heat to the end of the hair and then roll up, which means the end of your hair stays IN the heat for a long period of time, again causing damage, but with this iron you start at the scalp and work your way down the hair. Heat is applied evenly throughout the entire length of hair...no damage! I have long hair and can do my whole head in about 15 minutes and it stays wavy for the whole day!! (I wash my hair daily so haven't ever tried longer) my ONLY complaint is that you need good hand/arm strength because there is no finger hold at the end of the heat element for your opposite hand to hold the wand closed. I suppose some people would 'lock' the irons closed on the hair, but that scares me. Otherwise, I am loving this curler!

So I keep checking making sure it’s on the right setting all the time. It’s really no biggie, I noticed this on many hair products, especially with heat settings “knob”, but they should update that.

It cuts my hair curling time in half when I use this. Waves hair and heats up very quickly!! It definitely does its job 👌🏽 My three cons of this awesome product are the following: -there’s no cover on the outside of the wave irons, so it’s very easy for even a grown woman like myself to burn myself when trying to put my hair in the iron or if I have it too close to my neck -it’s very large and bulky (part of the reason I’ve burnt myself before), so you can easily burn yourself. I also wouldn’t consider taking it on vacation unless I had a lot of room. -if you’re not very careful you can make your hair look crimped, not waved. Practice makes perfect, so angling the iron differently with each chunk of hair will give it more of a waved look. I also mix it up with an actual curling wand OR straightener (to make waves) every other layer of hair as to not have the crimped look. If the cons don’t make you hesitate, buy it!

I'm not terribly skilled with a curling iron and this seemed easy enough to use. It's basically a crimper, so no need to twist the iron to use it. The hardest part is getting the back of your head, but since you don't need to be really precise with this, it isn't too bad. The first two pictures were taken right after I used the iron. It's a little too crimped looking for my taste. The second two are after I'd slept on them, taken the next day. I prefer the way it looks after having slept on my hair. The waves look more relaxed and natural. My hair does hold curl pretty well, but I feel like a curling iron wouldn't hold as well as this does. I don't use any product in my hair, and I use it on clean hair (I wash my hair every day). The waves last all through the next day until I shower again. Biggest complaint for this product is the temperature control dial. It isn't digital and there are no numbers on the dial, so you really don't know how hot it is. The placement of the dial is near where I grab the iron to use it, so sometimes my fingers probably rotate the dial on accident and change the temperature without meaning to.

But it’s short enough and extends enough that it fits most of the scenarios I would need it for. If I need the front of my rifle resting between open and closed I just use a sand sock or shooting bag.

When I preload the system, the foregrip torques and causes uneven pressure on the barrel, which makes a 0.66MOA gun open up to about a 3-4MOA group size. This makes me sad, because it;s a very good bipod, and the flaw is down to the poor design of the CETME foregrip. SO like most of the rest of the gun, I am currently redesigning and rebuilding the foregrip from scratch for optimum accuracy. What I like about the Magpul bipod: -Lovely light weight. Minimally interferes with balance. -Grabby feet. Can preload reasonably well on concrete shooting benches, mowed grass, roofing shingles, asphalt pavement. -Quick and positive locking system makes for fast and easy deployment and retraction. -QD Harris stud model is genuinely very quick to detach if you want to stow it and go. Not as fast as a cam lock, but there are concessions to be made if you want the slimmest and lightest option available. What I'm not so crazy about: -I got spoiled by the UTG Mlok bipod legs and their otherworldly stability. This Harros QD model does not have that and lacks proper transit capability to make up, offering only a roll feature. -Feels flimsy when you manhandle it. I have not broken it yet, but the extreme light weight does not come without cost. -Model lacks 45-degree lock for legs, so it's not easy to brace up against vertical or angled cover. You kinda just have to mash it in, adjust pressure on the weapon, and hope for the best. Final verdict - I am unsure of how it will hold up over time. More modern plastics have a way of being tougher than first impressions suggest. SOME TIMES. It ends up being more about the design than about the material with polymers. Magpul seems to grok with this pretty well. For this reason, my estimate is that the stripped-down feature set was the corner that was cut to achieve such a comfortable low weight, rather than durability. Only time will tell, but I've beaten on it rather a lot so far. I have had a lot more tooth-grinding, oops-did-I-just-break-it moments than I have with any other bipod, but this could also be down to my having had the audacity to bolt it to a beastly13lb tactical SASR rather than the typical M4gery.

The installation is extremely easy, thanks to the M-Lok system. The bi-pod is very nice quality and feels sturdy. It has no external springs, everything is encased inside the polymer casing. The legs rotate down and snap into place, and are locked in place until you press the side buttons to move them back. The legs also extend in locking segments, with a button on each leg. The bi-pod can pan and title, and has a very easy-to-use large grippy nut that adjusts the tension. This nut also allows you to spin the legs to either be pointing forwards, or backwards when mounted on the rifle. I love my Magpul Bi-pod and will definitely be using this product on future builds!

I have the severely excellent and unquestionably expensive Atlas PRS on my 308, and it lives up to its billing and provides excellent value for the money. But I wanted to find something even lighter, because the Beo is already heavy enough as it is and I'm not getting any younger. Fortunately, I found the Magpul Rifle Bipod. On paper the MRB supposedly offers an Atlas like solution (cant and pivot, really?) for less than half of the price of an Atlas, so I ordered one with a heavy dose of scepticism despite the Magpul name on the product. Well, it is just a fantastic bipod. Well designed, well built, light weight and (really) easy to deploy.

You get more degrees of panning/tilt than the atlas. The adjustments are easy and intuitive. You can also loosen the adjustment all the way and flip the legs around backward if you wanted to have it stow away backwards or something to move through heavy brush or whatever, than engage and use the bipod in that position or flip it back around. That's not really advertised as a feature, but the functionality is there.

First and foremost it is extremely light weight. Possibly the lightest on the market with the features it brings to the table. The price is outstanding as well considering the impressive list of capabilities is has. I dare you to find another bipod in this price range that is this light with the ability to cant and pivot the weapon. It has a considerable of flex, and is meant to be ""weighted"" prior to pulling the trigger by pushing or pulling the gun. The knurled knob is excellent and makes on the fly adjustments easier than getting your dog to eat of bite of steak. When stowed it can be cranked down preventing the pod from moving around. It is not as stable as a Harris with spring loaded legs but to pull of a 11 oz pod with the same features as a Harris sacrifices must be made. The legs adjust super fast with push button retraction and will not fold up when loaded. Not being spring tension legs, you also do not have to worry about unexpected folding and the bloody hands that go along with it. Magpul always comes correct with new products and this is no exception. Just realize the limitations of this pod before buying. This is a light and fast style pod meant long patrols or long humps to that tree stand or final firing position.

I liken it back to when auto makers stopped making metal dashboards and started using plastic. People whined back then, also. Didn't matter that the new dashboard was safer, didn't matter that the new dashboard was better, all that mattered was it was different. It wasn't the way it always was. Fast forward to now. Bipods used to heavy. Bipods used to be all metal. Exposed springs like some steampunk contraption at a festival. Close a metal bipod the wrong way, you got blood on your hands. Literally. Enter Magpul. Magpul reinvented the bipod. Lightweight polymers (not plastic), no exposed springs. Streamline. More features are standard that cost extra on other metal bipods. More advanced then the 1930's style metal bipods so common, even today. Let's look at the ""faults"" that those who hate to evolve and accept technological advances have repeated over and over; 1. ""It's wobbly."". No it's not. If you know how to USE a bipod properly, it's not wobbly. Load the bipod correctly (and if you don't know what that means, don't buy a bipod) and it's rock steady. The ""wobble"", per se, was purposely built into the bipod so you CAN load it properly. 2. ""Too much plastic"". First off, it's Magpul's proprietary polymer that they invented, it's NOT plastic. Same polymer that their stocks, mags, grips are made of. No one finds faults with them, only the ""bipod people"" find faults with using their polymer. Metal is used where it needs to be, but because it's different, it's too modern, purists refuse to adapt. They want the bipod they started using in the 70's. Those days are gone. Those that hate this product probably still whine about the good ol' days and still miss their pagers and flip phone that only made phone calls. Now to those that think I'm a young'n whining about the old folks, I'm 60 years old. I ain't young. But I'm not afraid of technology. The ""good ol' days"" weren't all that great. THESE are the good ol' days. To those reading the negative comments, disregard them. They know not of what they speak.

I can't tell you how many times I have banged my fingers on the handguard when collapsing the Harris legs. This is due to the spring loaded action that are built on. On the contrary, the Magpul legs are kept in place and lock in a couple positions with a button and there is no tension, so my fingers do not slam into the frame of the weapon. The magpul bipod has a knurled knob that allows both tilt and rotation functionality. Overall, this is a very easy to use bipod with as much flexibility as any other 6-9"" device I have used from other manufacturers. If you watch Amazon, you can often find great deals from Amazon Warehouse, as I have done twice. Each time the bipod that I received was in excellent condition, though the box was rather beat up. On the last one, the MLOK screws and nuts were missing, but a quick chat with the Amazon CS team resulted in a credit to my account, which was enough to cover a new set.

After reading tons of reviews and getting some serious trigger time myself, I've come up with the following observations/recommendations: Feels very real in your hands. Flip up sights are cheap junk and really don't look like they belong on such a great looking rifle. Crossman should really pony up and put some decent flip-up iron sights on this thing. How much could it cost at such volumes? Anyway, I took them off and replaced with cheap red/green dot scope before the first loading. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019MN7N5U/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 After handling his rifle for a few hours now I believe it would be excellent for introduction training for a real AR. All controls work very close to a real AR (except fwd assist which rarely gets used anyway). Trigger is a bit stiff and appears to behave like a 2-stage trigger. At abt 90% of trigger force applied, there's a faint click, then a bit more squeeze and it fires. Not sure if this was an intentional feature but it's very consistent and I like it. At 30 ft, with fresh co2, I'm grouping 25 rnds within an inch in semi-auto (with a rest). Holds elevation pretty well for first 6 mags. Elevation drops 2-3 inches @ 30 ft. on last (7th) mag. When co2 gets low, rifle occasionally does some weird stuff like double firing or dry firing. When co2 gets really low, you have to use the charge lever between shots, but by then it's time to replaced co2 anyway. From what I've heard, to extend the life of the rifle, you shouldn't run full auto with fresh co2 cyls or near empty ones either. Shoot the first mag in semi-auto then switch to full-auto for a couple of mags, then back to semi-auto until co2 is gone. Also, not too much full auto until you have a few hounded rnds thru it. Seems like good advice since moving parts need to wear-in. First 1500 BBs were Hornady Black Diamond since I heard they load easier (and they are). Speed loader takes a little getting used to, but after you get the hang of it, it's great. I spray a little Rem oil in the loader, load it between 1/2 and 3/4 full then another quick spray of oil. Then shake it to distribute the oil around. Switched to Daisy zinc coated BB's since local store was out of Hornady's. They are a little more difficult to load but so far no issues with first 1000 rounds. Daisy grouped as well as the Hornady's. When speed loader plunger jams, don't force it. Just flip it upside down (while still connected to mag) and gently work the plunger until it un-jams, then flip it back upright and continue. At first it didn't seem to shoot more than abt 75-100 rnds before running out of co2 (semi-auto only). When removing right (secondary) cylinder, a LOT of co2 escaped. Inspected piercing pin and it looked OK. Next time removing co2 cylinders, I loosened the right cyl very very slowly. Noticed after abt 1/4 turn loosening, the right cyl got cold but wasn't leaking. I was then able to fire another 75 or so rnds. Next time I loaded 2 new cyls, I tightened the left cyl normally. On the right cyl, I tightened until it was abt as tight as I could get it with the supplied wrench, then backed it off exactly 1/4 turn. Now it works as it should. I've ran 6 cyls thru it this way and so far so good. There's something odd going on inside the mag that makes the right cylinder not flow if cyl is screwed on really tight but this appears to be a good work-around so far. Microscopic manual says to oil after ~1000 rnds. That's what I did. Maybe Crossman wants to parts to wear-in before oiling?? I applied pelgunoil to the co2 tips and everything else that moves including the seal. Feels significantly smoother now. I've heard pelgunoil is actually non-detergent ATF. When the pelgunoil tube runs out, I'll probably refill it with ATF and keep rolling. EDIT: After a hit more research, looks like silicone oil is supposed to be used on the green seal, in the cyl where green seal slides into and on the seal at output of the magazine. I'll be switching over to silicone oil for these parts. Still using pelgunoil for tips of co2 cyls. IMHO, this was a steal at $145. Even at $180 it's still a bargain. I've had a lot of fun with it and actually feel I'm improving my target acquisition time and muscle memory.

This is less than 1 cent per shot. I'm comparing this to the real thing for those interested in at home training: -Upper and lower receiver and rail are plastic, but I havent perceived this to be detrimental. -sights are super cheap (I put on a super cheap red dot and dont plan on using the plastic irons) -weight is decent, though a little light toward the muzzle. There is obviously weight added to the body and the magazine is weighted. -there really is a little recoil. I can see my red dot point of aim twitch when I shoot. Makes for much better realism. -the trigger is way too heavy. Other reviews have tested it around 9 lbs. I wondered what that would feel like. It feels seriously, distractingly, slow down your rate of fire heavy. It's not like a heavy double action trigger. More like a normal mil spec trigger during take up, but that takes twice as much effort to break the shot. I'm going to try to get the (housed) trigger mechanism out to see if I can modify this. Not a deal breaker though. -the side picatinny rails on the fore end are removable. I was happy to discover this, as it helps slim down the grip. Probably not intended as a feature, but I took advantage of it. It looks like you do need to out the rearmost screws back in to resecure the fore end to the upper receiver. -I didnt think I would use full auto much, and maybe I won't in the long run, but it's way more fun than I thought it would be. Because of the reciprocating bolt it feels quite substantial. Significant giggle factor. -the charging handle feels and latches like a real one. It is lighter and has less travel than on an AR 15, however. I think it's actually aluminum. -adjustable stock locks up decently. -Safety/fire selector is lighter (easier to move) than normal, and feels like it's in a slightly odd spot. I could be off, but sweeping it doesnt feel quite right. Not a big deal. -bolt locks back on empty, stays locked back when you remove the magazine, bolt release works like normal to drop the bolt when you reinsert a magazine. Overall super pleased with this purchase. This is a steal for a gas blowback air rifle. I'm really glad I went with this over a comparably priced electric airsoft rifle. I got through 4 or 5 magazines on two CO2 cartridges. In bulk they are less than .50 a piece, so this is very cheap to shoot.

I’ve had 5 friends shoot it and they all walk away with a smile. The fact that you can break it down and clean it like a real AR is super impressive. I would recommend oiling everything down as you would a real rifle as it makes it function a little smoother or at least sounds like it does. Accuracy drops off after a bit as the gun gets cold.

While it does function as a pretty good training tool before we step up to a 22lr, it's also just a barrel of fun. For the money, there's few better ways to spend a couple of hours on a warm afternoon. PROS: Good C02 life...I get about 14 (or 350 bbs) magazines per pair of cartridges running full auto, and about 16 magazines if I run semi-auto. Muzzle velocity and therefore accuracy drops after about 8-9 magazines, but moving a few feet closer to the target when that happens negates this change. This functions about 85% the same as a standard AR rifle, so its a great platform to introduce the kids on. Accuracy is pretty good for an inexpensive bb gun. We shoot it between 5-10 yards depending on weather conditions and C02 charge, and it makes consistent hits on the target (6"" rubber ""gong"" in a homemade bb catch box). My rifle has been 100% reliable since I've owned it...it's had somewhere around 2500 bbs down the barrel. I do lubricate the rifle each time we change C02. CONS: Included sights are junk. I put a spare set of UTG flip-ups I had laying around on it and they've been much better. Trigger pull is a bit heavy for young kids...I have to squeeze the trigger for my 2-year-old as she learns to point and steady the rifle, whereas she can work the trigger on our Crosman PSM45 pistol on her own. I haven't put a gauge on it, but I'd estimate it's about a 7-8lb pull. I don't have a whole lot of luck with the included speed loader, but it only takes about 20-30 seconds to load the magazine by hand. I have a few spares that are on backorder, so it'll be nice to have those. The screws that push the C02 cartridges in place use a hex key (one is included). This is fine, but I'd rather just have a phillips slot so I could just use a regular screw driver. Overall, I've been very satisfied with this product...yes, it's mostly plastic, but it's well made and if you take care of it and realize that at the end of the day it's a toy, it should last for a long time. I'll probably end up ordering another one so we can shoot more than one at a time.",,3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFSXWRCULKZZABIQ2KFKXHG6PETQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07K6RDB8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,DPMS,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMF2QZSL5BKLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07K6RDB8B,B07K6RDB8B

Not to to where you need earplugs but It let's you know you're still technically shooting a weapon. I like to describe the noise as a small air powered jackhammer or nail gun. Its actually pretty dam accurate too and the red dot scope even lines up with the laser I mounted and holds a pretty tight grouping at about 15 yards. I'm almost wondering how long until they ban full auto bb guns, because it's way too much fun to be legal. Just gotta make sure to buy plenty of ammo and c02 cartridges with it because it eats them. One full mag of co2 is good for like 200 shots. So fill up 5 and you got yourself a pretty fun afternoon. Like I'd plan to be ordering a steady supply of them off Amazon (packs of 40 co2 cartridges for 15 bucks) or just stock pile them because it is that much fun to shoot. I also just barely ordered an umarex m712 mauser broomhandle as a backup with another spare mag as well. Super excited to have that as my ""sidearm"" carry when I'm plinking in the backyard. Apparently that also has a full auto selector switch. I've definetly found my new hobby. I used to have bb guns when I was a small kid but this is a game changer.

Literally has the same heft and balance. Controls are the same, from the safety to the charging handle. Trigger is probably similar to military grade, but heavier than most civilian ARs. To shoot, you pre load the 'magazine' with Co2 cargridges - 2 of them using the supplied tool, and noting which one goes in first - and fill mag with BBs. Both are pretty straightforward, and easy enough to figure out. The mag feels 'heavy' but when in the gun, it gives the gun a similar heft and balance of an AR. It even has Picatinny rails to add a light, laser, or dot sight if you want. Standard sights are fold down plastic, with a knob to adjust windage. Front sight is fixed, but mine shot low, so it was simple to sight in by filing it down a little at a time. The sights are not that clear to see through, with quite a bit of glare in the rear peep. I'm thinking of trying to find a needle file or something to rough it up with. Rear sight has two apertures, I use the large one most of the time because of the glare I just mentioned. Accuracy is decent for a BB gun, but not stellar, but I don't think anyone bought this gun for maximum precision. Where this gun shines, is maximum FUN. Flip the safety from semi-auto to full-auto and it's a blast. Empties the 25 shot magazine in something like 2 or 2 1/2 seconds. WOW, just WOW. The action even moves back and forth, which gives a feeling of recoil for each shot. This thing is way too much fun! Best if used in 3-5 shot bursts, otherwise you'll feel like all you do is reload, which is a good excuse to get a second magazine. The mag seems pricey, but looking at it, most of the 'wear' items are in the mag. By this I mean the Co2 holders, and associated seals, as well as the BB feed mechanism, is all incorporated in the mag. If a seal goes bad and leaks out Co2 between shots, replacing the mag should solve it. The gun even breaks open to clean, the same way an AR does. It is realistic enough I almost wish it had a bright orange tip on the barrel so everyone would know it is not a 'real' firearm.

But when I opened the box and took inventory nothing was missing. I watched several videos of this gun before I bought it so I was already familiar with the set up and basic operation which is fortunate because the instructions are written in the tiniest font imaginable. I was also a little wary of the speed loader because so many people have complained about not being able to make it work but I found it extremely easy to use and very efficient. Also, I don't know if the manufacturer redesigned the magazine but mine has a tab to hold back the spring which is key for using the speed loader and others have commented their magazine doesn't have one. After setting it up I put up a full size silhouette target and fired off a couple of single fire shots to get accustomed to the flip up sights. The sights really are terrible but I have a spare red dot I'm going to mount on the pic rail so I don't really care about them. At about 20 yards I was placing shots accurately so I decided to fire a few bursts. Man oh man is this fun! I tore up the target with tight groupings on full auto, reloaded and repeated until I burned through my first 2 cylinders of CO2. The trigger pull takes some getting used to because it is very heavy but that doesn't diminish the fun. If you're on the fence about buying one my advice is to just pull the trigger and get it.

It is more fun than you can imagine!,"Pros: This gun is so much fun to shoot! Full auto mode leads to spontaneous giggling from the shooter and spectators alike. Weight and balance are very much like the real thing. Charging handle, safety/fire selector, are very realistic, although the forward assist is non-functional. Did I say how much fun it is to shoot this thing? Surprisingly accurate. The attached photo is from my 1st 100 shots. The tight clusters are from 3 25-round full auto bursts. The others are from semi-auto file as I tried to use the flip-up sights. All were at 30 ft. Cons: The flip-up sights aren't much use, at least for my eyes. In most lighting conditions, I found that the smooth inside surface of the cylindrical rear sight aperture was too reflective, causing enough glare to block out the front post sight entirely. It is far too loud to be back yard friendly, if neighbors are close. The loading tool is temperamental at best, jamming frequently. It is made of light plastic that feels like it will break at any moment. When it's functioning properly, it is a major improvement over hand-loading, but of 10 loading attempts, I only had 1 load the full 25 BBs without failure. Final take: If you are interested in this gun at all, BUY IT NOW. Once you fire it, you will honestly wonder why you waited at all. Ignore the loading tool. Buy your BBs in the dispenser with the little tapered spout. Just hold the bb follower back with your thumb (manual says ""lock it back"", but that's a misprint), tip the mag so the top end is a bit downward, and pour the BBs into the feeding hole till the slot is full. Release the follower. Don't worry if you spill some, cuz you'll be spilling a lot more real soon. Order extra magazines! The 25 rds go so fast, you'll be glad you spent the $50 a piece, just so you can keep shooting. Mount a Red Dot reflex optic or Laser for better point and shoot target acquisition.",,376,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGHVMQUBR5GA7H3LMEFPKBVHYT2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07K6RDB8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,DPMS,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y64OKN2O1G5T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07K6RDB8B,B07K6RDB8B

The sights are plastic and there is no elevation adjustment, for the price they could have included all metal, fully adjustable sights. Would have also been better to make the muzzle thread something common, 14mm ccw is fairly common with airsoft though so adding a metal muzzle accessory may help with the balance.

It arrived and I was all set to try it out, but the speed loader malfunctioned. When depressing the feed shaft it immediately got stuck and would not move. I know about the special attachment to hold the magazine slide back while feeding in the BBs. I have several Airsoft guns and bout eight speed loaders, all work perfectly. This is a problem in manufacture or design, I tried several things to get it to work but it wouldn't. It made loading the magazine very cumbersome, a latch to hold the feed spring back while inserting BBs into the magazine would have been a simple design feature to make loading BBs in simpler. I will contact Crossman to see if there's a fix for the speed loader and maybe I can give this the five stars I would have liked to. With all the time I spent trying to get the speed loader to work it got dark so I wasn't able to shoot it much. Contacted both vendor and Crosman, both gave quick response. Some BBs are larger than others and will not feed as well, Crosman said to add a few drops of airgun oil. After working it a while I can now get it to feed. It appears to be a copy of the Umarex BB speed loader, slight grip shape difference but internals are identical (I took both apart).

As long as you lubricate prior to use, and maintain the rifle ( like you would with a real AR ), you should be fine. I suspect most people didn't do that - hence why they have so much trouble with it. You wouldn't drive your car without oil - so why wouldn't you lubricate working metal parts? Don't buy this for accuracy. Buy it for fun. CONS: ( -1 ) - Accurate to about 10 feet. After that, expect the equivalent of spray and pray. Be prepared to cant your shots at anything over 20 feet away.[ - C02 canisters last for around 8-9 loads, then will be fairly useless. Be prepared to buy in bulk - Very little power - zero penetration at distance. - Reloading is a PITA. Reloader is useless. - Additional Mags are expensive, but they also hold CO2 - Plastic sights should be removed asap. They are useless for accuracy. -6 points PROS (x2 ) - This is SO MUCH FUN!! - Reloading is easier if you manually load BBs. A straw will be helpful to hold the BBs. - Single-shots will yield 15% more C02 than full auto. - Decent control when shooting in bursts of 3-4 bbs. - Expect 8-10"" of accuracy at 40ft for the first 50 shots in semi-auto. PROS (+1) - As long as you APPLY lubrication to the tops of CO2 canisters ( oil not provided ), you should get a decent lifespan from the rifle. - Compared to my 4 ARs - this feels REAL. You can also add a faux reverse threaded barrel shroud at the end to eliminate the SBR aesthetic. It has the right weight, the right balance. - Breaks down just like a real AR. Pop two pins, remove ""BCG"" and clean/lube for longer life. Use charging handle, fire select, mag eject, or BCG release just like a real AR. *forward assist is only there for aesthetics. - C02 cartriges are WAY cheaper than 5.56mm rounds. - Rail is plastic, but it will easily accomodate a holo or other optics.

If you have a real gun this is great for testing accessories in the back yard. It is a very realistic copy of a real AR-15. Only problem is it comes with a very useful ""autoloader"" for the BBs. However if the spring lock mechanism releases while using the autoloader to load BBs you can accidentally put BBs into the spring which is a fatal mistake and makes the loading magazine useless as well as the gun! You can only extract the BBs by expanding the spring so the BBs can fall out. Small scissors or scissor like tweezers used in a way to expand the spring can extract the BBs. Trouble is if you stretch the spring too much it will become very difficult to retract to lock it in place and load BBs. I gave up and ordered a new magazine for $50 and threw the original away.

Just enough to turn nearly white, but heated bread into beautiful toast. And I love the bagel setting that just toasts the side you can see, not both sides. I haven't tried the defrost setting yet. But the best control on the toaster is the button in the middle of the dial that will just make it stop toasting and pop the bread up if you can see that it's getting darker than you want it. And it REALLY pops the bread up, usually, it goes airborne just enough to sit on the top of the toaster and stay warm.

It is too soon though to evaluate the more advanced features otherwise. This toaster in fact has such a wide slot it is virtually impossible to image anything typically toasted that won't fit in it. Today we used it with toaster waffles. The top opening is 1-1/2 inches wide and the width is almost 10-1/2 inches. At least 1/4 inch of the width is restricted by guide wires in the device, but how many things do you have greater than 1-1/4 inches thick to toast. Of course do not put in anything that will melt or cause a hazard. You do not want to have to figure out how to clean up a sticky mess inside a toaster of any type. It is though ideal for toasting bread before buttering and frying it to make grilled cheese on a frying surface. For that I use a pancake griddle myself, but by toasting the bread before buttering both sides lets it keep proper shape as you turn over and combine the bread with cheese in between. It also adds a crispness that is missing from most done by restaurants.",,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGQLH5ZUOZ6HVBSIK5RVSWXGZSOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07PZY11WN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,DASH,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38GJLSETJQBPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07PZY11WN,B07PZY11WN

I mean...it’s a toaster so you are probably wondering what’s so great about a toaster? It just toasts bread, right? WRONG. It beautifully and wonderfully toasts bread and it’s settings are perfection. You can toast bread, English muffins, bagels...even has a reheat button for when your treat has grown cold. It has a window, which can be removed for easy cleaning, where you watch your bread, brown so effortlessly. Easy to clean crumb tray that glides out from the side. BUT the thing that makes it a star for me, above all the other great features mentioned above, it’s not the normal bulky looking toaster that just takes up room on your counter. This is longer and more narrow, in fact, the bread sits in the same slot, not two individual slots. The design gives this a streamlined appearance...clean lines and no bulk. It can sit against your counters backsplash, freeing up valuable space. Whomever designed this is like the the Frank Lloyd Wright of toaster architecture!

The extra long, sideways orientation allows it to remain on the counter without taking up much space. The window and overall exterior design elements are nice, so it looks good if you do leave it out. The only complaint about the design is that the tray that holds the bread is pitched downward when the handle is not depressed. Because there is a window, when the toaster is not in use, you can see the metal tray angling downward. It's not a huge deal, but it ruins a bit of the aesthetic. The function is typical but comes with a few minor issues. In order to use the reheat or bagel settings, you depress the handle and start toasting normally - then press the button for those specialty functions. Again, minor, but it would be better to select that option first. Second, the slot is about an inch too short to be able to toast 2 large pieces of bread at once time. If you make homemade bread or buy ""double-wrapped) breads like Brownberry/Pepperidge Farm, you have to orient one up and one down and then squish them in. Toasting quality is fine, but is not completely even. I did have an issue with product quality. The first toaster I received only lasted a few months before the front toasting element broke. I was able to get it exchanged and the new unit has worked without issue for the two months I have had it. Overall, I feel the minor issues are overcome by the appearance and I would recommend it for anyone who wants a unique looking toaster - just know that there are a few issues that could be a deal-breaker for some.",,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEW353QPPVIJ25MBCZTQCQ5PS7AA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07PZY11WN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,DASH,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EYEZ8KO1VA7F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07PZY11WN,B07PZY11WN

So i was surprised with it delivered just a day later and am I glad it did. Take a look at these pics - on bagel setting an #7 on the dial. FINALLY A TOASTER THAT MAKES FLAWLESS EVERYTHING CIABATTA ROLLS! And at that super duper Prime Day price...the toaster itself fits perfectly with my modern kitchen decor! Note in the pics the even toasting. The back and inside were soft and yummy with that toasted crunchy front. And realize the top and the bottom are NOT the same thickness. Who would have thought? BTW I also own a Dash egg cooker. I'm really impressed with Dash products. Their designs are great and quality control is clearly on top of their list.

These fit the bill nicely and they do a better job than I thought they would. I can toast mini-bagels and retrieve them without having to poke something inside the toaster to get them out, and I can toast door-step slices of tall bread. There's a rod that glows along the top and bottom of each side of the toaster which (so far) do a good job of evenly toasting. I haven't tried yet, but apparently you can pop the side out to clean the glass which I hope means it will be easier to clean out if/when a piece of food breaks off inside (a common hazard with gluten free foods as they can be fragile).",,10,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEW42CMZGUH6M6CZHBX7MQRXVNWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07PZY11WN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,DASH,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SOHX287ODO80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07PZY11WN,B07PZY11WN

Nothing is worse than burning your last slice of bread because someone failed to tell you they turned up the darkness setting the day before.

I haven’t been able to find a durable, reasonably priced toaster that could accommodate long slices or bagels, etc. Additionally, I have had to be gluten-free for the last 10 years and gluten-free bread has to be carefully toasted in order to be good. All the toasters I have ever owned had those fragile, thin wires that heat up & glow to toast the bread. And when they broke, which they inevitably did, the bread toasted unevenly. THIS TOASTER has unique coils in the bottom, so that you would expect unevenly toasted bread. BUT NO! It’s the most perfectly toasted bread I’ve had in 30 years. (I can’t remember past that!) I would have liked to have had 2 slots, but I’m guessing that the bread would not toast as evenly with 2 slots. After a little trial & error, you can learn & dial your preferences for each type of bread you like. And you can watch through the window to see your desired brownness. Now, many have complained about the toaster ejecting the toast when done. It happened once for me, so I picked it up off of my clean counter top and put it on the plate! One piece does often jump out of the slot onto the top of the toaster! It’s actually amusing! It puts a smile on my face and a little happy in my day!

I went looking for the same brand, but they don't make toasters anymore. I took quite awhile researching other brands, and then came across this one; different and interesting, with its long shape and see-through window. The reviews were good overall, so I bought it. We use our toaster alot and have been using this one for about a month, now, and just love it! The see-through window is perfect if you toast different types and thicknesses of bread. No flipping up the toast to see if it's done or waiting til you see smoke to know you went too far. It toasts very evenly, much better than our old one. You can easily fit 2 slices of bread or 4 pcs (2 buns, cut in half) of the smaller hamburger buns, side by side, into this toaster, and each piece toasts perfectly evenly. At first I wondered about the long length taking up more counter space, but it really doesn't because it's so much thinner than the traditionally shaped ""thick slice"" toaster it replaced. It not only performs well, it's also a nice looking toaster (I got black, mostly because it was a few dollars cheaper than the other colors), and people are always very intrigued when they see it. As other reviews have mentioned, it does pop up with considerable force, and sometimes (not very often), the bread will jump right out of the toaster, more so if toasting small, light weight pieces like half slices of small buns. In spite of that, I really like this unit and give it 5 stars. The only thing I CAN'T rate yet is how long it will last. I have my doubts it'll still be pumping out toast in 20-25 yrs like the old one (things never seem to last like their predecessors anymore), but we'll see.

It catches all the crumbs, is easily removable without moving the toaster and is easy to clean. The darkness is very consistent: The same bread with the same setting gets the same darkness every time, even if you do two batches in a row. The viewing window is a great feature. You can really see what's happening. The window is double pane for insulation. The inner pane is removable for cleaning, but it doesn't need to be cleaned very often. The toast lifter is a little over-enthusiastic. A single normal sized slice of bread will often leave the toaster, especially if the toaster isn't on a level surface.

No more burned bagels!,"Got this about a week ago and I’m VERY satisfied. I’ve had none of the issues other reviews mention, such bread getting launched out with too much force. No such issues with my Dash toaster. Things I love about it: 1) It has quartz rods that I’ve read are a more expensive, higher quality build than other heating elements. Heats up quickly and the toasting is even and the settings, reliable. Different bread densities require different settings. 2). I like the glass window a lot. I’ve burned a lot of toast and bagels and it’s so frustrating when you burn the very last one. The window is so helpful to gauge what setting to use in the future, for a particular type of bread. 3). I really like the design of one long slot. So much easier to toast Shepherds or Sourdough slices. 4. Nice wide slot is wide enough to toast a thick bagel or bun that’s been sliced in half. 5). Takes up minimal counter space because it sits horizontally against the backsplash. And it stays pretty cool. No problem heating up the nearby cupboards above or next to it. I paid a $10 more for it here on Amazon because I’ve had bad luck buying small appliances in a club store. The club store purchases always seem to have an issue. Maybe I’ve been unlucky? But this toaster, bought on Amazon has been a very good buy. I have no complaints! Just be sure to use the cancel button to pop up early! The lever is intended to push down only.

Of all the toasters on Amazon (and believe me, I looked at them all, even the insanely expensive ones), I settled on this beauty for a number of reasons. First of all, it's design is unique and beautiful. I wanted the red but talked myself into the black because it's got to sit on the counter all the time. Only the top silver rectangle around the opening gets hot. I can touch both the window and the black plastic surround while cooking without discomfort. The window is both pretty and functional because you can gauge how you bread is toasting at any given time. We gave up on the last toaster because of how unevenly it cooked, and because my husband is fond of what my mother-in-law calls ""warm bread not toast"", it's important it doesn't get too brown for him. Having the window helps ensure that. Which leads to my next point... Even toasting. I chose this toaster because I could tell by looking if it was toasting evenly. I have had it for several months now with use 2-3 times a week, and my toast comes out just the way I want it to every time. My preferred setting is 3.5 on the dial. This gives me my ideal all-over light brown crunch that I enjoy. For my husband, 2 is the preferred setting--just a hint of brown across the bread with just a bit of a crunch. A 1 basically just warms the bread to melt soft butter--no crunch. I haven't tested anything higher, but based on those settings, I'd say lovers of a dark brown toast would be happy on the 5 setting. Who would use 7, I don't know. Ha! Indeed, the opening is wide enough to accept a bagel or thicker homemade slices of bread. The double-wide length and bigger opening was important to me because I'm delving into the world of bread making, and homemade loaves are imperfect and cannot readily fit into a traditional toaster. Extra wide loaf slices can fit in here if you do one at a time. Though many other toasters had all kinds of fancy high end features, this one had what we really needed. We have a toaster oven for pizza muffins and grilled cheeses so no need for sideways settings, and we don't do much more than toast, though this does have a defrost feature which I never use nor will I ever really use it (nothing to defrost).

Why should anyone want to write a review of the most used and easiest to forget ancillary appliance you own? Because the Dash Clear View Toaster is that awesome! The short of it; don’t waste your time looking for anything else. This toaster can handle anything you throw at it with golden brown perfection, quickly. The Dash Clear View Toaster is the best bang for your buck, hands down! The long of it. We are a “somewhat” healthy eating family. We run the gambit when it comes to bread choices. Hardly ever white, mostly wheat for the kids, and tapioca and/or rice bread for the adults. Not all breads toast to perfection at the same rate. Each one of these breads has a very specific heat tolerance that can make for difficult toasting times. And that’s where the window really comes in handy. With the Dash Clear View Toaster you can sit back and enjoy the toasting experience all while watching the progress through its’ front window. Gone are the days of premature toast ejection just to check on the “doneness” of a specific bread only to have to reinsert the payload back into the heated bay. Visible perfection each and every time. With the white or Tapioca bread, which toast rather quickly, a quick turn to 4 gives us the perfect amount of crunch. The wheat bread takes slightly longer, about a 5 to a 5.5 max. And then there is the ALWAYS FROZEN rice bread. This beast of a bread (Food for Life brand) is twice toasted. Once as a 7 with “defrost” selected and a second plunge at a 7 without the “defrost” selected. AMAZING! The controls are easy to understand, clearly marked and simple to operate. Plug it in, place the toast in the slot provided, push down the plunger and away you go. It takes a matter of a use or two to figure out the proper settings to your liking. The “defrost” feature just doubles the time on the dial. The “bagel” feature only toasts on one side. With some sandwich breads like rye / pumpernickel etc. that have a tendency to toast really well and tear-up the roof of your mouth I like to use the bagel setting. Put the toasted side to the inside (meat side) and the soft untoasted side to the outside, you get the crunch without tearing up the roof of your mouth. AWESOMNESS! I have yet to use the “re-heat” feature … so you are on your own with that one. Sorry Charlie. As far as the toast rocketing from the toaster with the velocity of an unladen swallow, African or Eurpean – doesn’t matter, I have found that to be inconsequential. Does it pop up and sometime flop out on its own? Yes, rarely. But that has happened with my old toaster as well (a re-gifted 2 slice Panasonic that we got as a wedding gift 22 years ago). So really I kind of like the nostalgia of it when it does happen. BONUS! Let’s just hope that I get 22 years out of this amazing beast. So in conclusion, I just wrote an essay on a toaster. What the hell am I thinking?! Yes, it is that great. Click the “Add to Cart” button and get the Dash Clear View Toaster.

There is limited counter space in the kitchen of our Victorian home and we thought the wall hugging design of this toaster was a good idea. The design has a sort of 1950s vibe to it - sort of a Wurlitzer juke box or maybe a little hint of Flash Gordon going on. We really like it. The PROs: *Can't say enough good about being able to see how your toast is doing - it's a whole dimension of usefulness that other toasters don't even address. *All controls are up front and highly visible - no more having to crane your neck down to the side of your toaster to see which button is which - and then having to guess anyway because the printing has probably worn off...or having to wonder which way you have to turn the dial to get your toast lighter or darker. *Really nice looking and a bit different. We like things that are a bit different, like each other, or our kids, or our dogs. The CONs: *I thought about dinging it a star because, as others have reported, the ejection spring is a bit - how shall we put it? - enthusiastic. Especially with a smaller or lighter item it will occasionally launch your breakfast right out of the slot. But on second thought we find this amusing rather than annoying - and far preferable to having to fish your toast out of the slot because your spring has lost its mojo. So we actually consider this a little plus. In case you're wondering, when you select bagel it toasts the side that's facing the window so you can still see how your toast is doing, so the designers were on the ball there. Right now ours tends to brown more quickly toward the top than the bottom but other reviewers have noted that this somehow evens out over time so we'll give it the benefit of the doubt and hope this will happen with ours. It's not drastically uneven but it is noticeable right now. My wife was a bit hesitant to spend more than about twenty bucks for a toaster but we're both glad we did as this thing is designed so very well, looks absolutely great, and is something that is just a bit different from the standard polished cube, adding a touch of style to the kitchen counter. And being able to see how our toast is doing means we may well never burn a breakfast again.

Another unhappy mention for the Oster - it wouldn't pop the toast after maybe six months and I caught my kids fishing their toast out with a fork.

I never heard of the brand, but then again I never heard of ""LG"" either and look at what they've become. I've owned lots of toasters - from a $300 toaster from Williams Sonoma others from Wal Mart. Time will tell if this holds up but toasters are inherently disposable - they don't last forever. someone obviously took the time to design this - the features are great, it has a modern timeless look, and the ""warming stand"" on top is unique. Pus, it works great (my son thought it was an antennae!). The main thing I look for is the bread toasting function, and this toasts evenly and quickly.

I’v been using the toaster for two weeks. It works good. It was a hard time for me to choose which one to buy just two weeks ago. I read lots of reviews on different brands. They all have complaints. Finally I made my decision simply by the foldable rock design. After a week of use, I know better of it. I list em below. Pros It roasts maximum 4 slice a time, fast supply for a family’s breakfast. In addition, 2 different browns a time, satisfied different needs. There are enough adjustable functions-how brown, one side or two sides roasting. With the foldable racks, it fits not only sliced bread, but all shapes ones. It is easy to clean the surface, and I believe metal is more durable than plastic. Cons The roaster is light-weighted. It slips easily on the counter when I press the function buttons. It is difficult to clean the inside with a dishcloth. The only way I can do is heat it before use. Cautions Turn the round switch from small numbers, you may need several test before you know which number makes the brown you want. After push down the lever, don’t forget to press the function button-defrost or bagel, otherwise the lever will not pop up automatically. The surface is very hot after use. Leave it aside for a while, it will cool down.",,152,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEGPSNLVN7MVQTR2I66WTT7WP3FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07Q6P68X6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Yabano,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R178DJGLBGDZXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07Q6P68X6,B07Q6P68X6

It is amazing. Slots are big enough. It toasts darker (looks like the element wires are thicker than the Cuisinart) and the lever is able to be pushed up to raise your bread, if it is too short to grab after it pops up. And for those wanting the bagel function to only toast one side, it does do this. We have had this toaster a few months already and it looks like Amazon is saying that it is out of stock and has no idea if it will be coming back. Note: this toaster was available a while ago under a different manufacturer name with a good review. Amazon did not sell it, but had this one, the identical toaster under the Yabano name. So if you see the identical toaster under a brand new name, but looks identical, give it a try. Maybe that's what they have to do, keep renaming it, to bring it in from China? Who knows. It works. It's still working after months of daily use.

This was basically the same thing, but less expensive and able to grow with my baby as opposed to the $200 one-size alternative! I was also concerned about SIDS while using this, but I think it's more about being a mindful and watchful parent. My baby had a hard time sleeping on the 'hard flat open' surface recommended by the AAP--I know he COULD do it, but sheesh it took at least an hour for him to fall asleep and staying asleep was tough. Combine that with waking up every 1-2hrs to feed at night? And attempting to put him down for naps in the daytime?? SO HARD. As soon as I started using this as his bed (able to move it to my bedside bassinet or his crib), he immediately was sleeping better and quicker (and longer!). It's almost fishy how something as small as this could work, but it does. I think he appreciates the softer padding, but more especially the life-boat-like quality of being encapsulated all around that makes him feel cozy and safe. Pro: You can take this bed with you on trips and he'll sleep the same!! And picking him up to transfer while he's asleep is perfect. 100% recommend, even if you're skeptical.

We tried a snuggle me, thinking it would be a magic thing and safe because of the sling design; it was neither. My baby slept no better in it (at t time he was under 3 months and didn't want to sleep out of our arms) and all the sling did was make it so his head wedged against the padding when he occasionally managed to turn it. Since that was a fail and the dock-a-tot was $75 more, I didn't want to try it. But when he outgrew his newborn lounger that he used (finally) to nap, I tried this. I don't know if I would have felt safe bed-sharing with him in it when he was a newborn, but I wish I'd had it for those few nights where he just wouldn't sleep in his bassinet and I would cautiously pull him into bed with me. Now that he's almost 6 months I feel safe bed-sharing with him in this and it often works for naps. It is a life-saver for me on those inconsolable nights.

Miracles do happen!,"Tired mama here! My first child was a dream baby when it came to sleep... this next one, not so much. She’s 6 weeks old and was having the shortest, fussiest sleep at night. We have a bassinet that she would just never stay asleep in, waking every 60-90 minutes. Swaddling never worked and only made things worse because she wanted her arms out. She would wake up more frequently swaddling her arms down. I started having to sleep on the couch with her and use a infant lounger cushion. Once that stopped working I didn’t know what to do. I remembered a friend of mine had the more expensive “brand name” version of this and thought about getting one, because I was desperate for some sleep. I decided to try a more affordable off-brand one with good reviews. And can I tell you? HALLELUJAH! So very glad I found this. As soon as I put my baby in just to try it out, she closed her eyes and fell asleep, NO JOKE!! I actually cried happy tears. The first night she slept a solid 3 hours, woke to nurse, and went back to sleep right away to sleep another 3+ hours. On the 2nd night she slept 4.5 hours before she work to nurse. I was completely skeptical at first, but friends, this works. And it works well. If you’re desperate for sleep, give it a try. Also, I read several comments about how difficult it was to put together, but I didn’t find that at all. I folded the bottom pad lengthwise like a taco and inserted it into the cover with ease. The only thing I was it had a crease you could feel, so I made sure that was on the bottom side not directly under baby. The roll part that goes around baby is a bit tricky, but you just adjust it with a little trial and error, it wasn’t that difficult. Before first use I washed it and hung to dry. (Photo is of my little one sleeping soundly during a monitored nap, I don’t usually use a blanket at night, we use sleep sacks). My only one complaint is that I wish they had more colors!

After writing my initial review, I received a note from Buydeem to explain to them how I burned my finger because they thought it was impossible to to so. They asked that I CHANGE my review to reflect this. After re-reading my review, I realized I did not write a fair review and did not give them a fair rating of the toaster. Since the toaster’s tipping forward and dropping toward the floor and in trying to catch it I burned my finger was my fault in having it at the edge of the counter, I decided to explain it in the update and I changed my rating to a 5-star. As I stated both in the update and in the initial review, this is a GREAT toaster; in fact, I have yet to find a toast that does everything one could want from a toaster as well as toasting bread perfectly—fully browned top to bottom and left to right—except for the one that is handmade in England and sells for six (6) times the price of this toaster. Then, after making the change, I received another notice from Buydeem begging me to change my review as they had dropped from a 100 percent rating to 88 percent due to MY single rating. I wrote them back saying that I had already done so and asked them why they hadn’t bothered to look before they wrote me. Then, they wrote me back immediately asking me to add pictures or better still a video of me, I presume of my making toast so show how good the toaster is. I am telling the Amazon buying public this because I feel that this type of conduct by a seller, manufacturer, or vendor is pandering to an almost illegal degree. And I feel certain that it would be against Amazon’s rules that any of these companies/people are allowed to do. So beware, if you purchase this very fine toaster and don’t give it a 5-star review, you may be facing a, shall we call it ‘a comeback’ from Buydeem to fix your review and change it to a 5-star so they can keep their rating at 100 percent. They may or may not do this, but from my experience, they will. UPDATE: First, I want to add that when my review was posted, Buydeem wrote to me to review with me what I said below. First, they sent me a copy of the UL Certificate they received showing that the toaster is UL rated and indeed it is. So that issue has now been cleared up. Second, the fact that they contacted me shows they care about their product. Never has any product owner or manufacturer taken the time to reflect on what I said in a review which, to me, shows they are passionate about the products they make. So, I want to make another item in my review very clear. When I said that when I pushed both plungers (lift levers are what they are really called I know now) down to lower the bread into the toaster to be toasted, and the machine tilted forward and on one occasion burned my hand, this was a one off situation. I actually had the toaster at the edge of the counter because, as I said, it wobbled. It wobbled because a foot had come off during shipment and before I realized it and replaced it (it was in the box) I was trying to find out why my counter was so uneven. So, I moved it toward the front edge of the countertop and then tried pushing both lift levers down. Being a strong man, pushed too hard, the toaster flipped forward, fell off the counter, I tried to catch it and because I had just toasted four pieces of toast just before this, the toaster was already hot, when I caught it from falling to the floor, my fingers touched the hot part of the toaster, the chrome edge around the burners which on any toaster are always hot. My point was that if it tilts forward, and IF you accidentally touch that area of the toaster one could get burned. The toaster itself, the green body of the toaster, is very cool to the touch. I advised the person who contacted me that were the toaster a little heavier such as making it on a die-cast chassis, this would prevent this very light toaster from tipping forward when the lift levers are pressed downward too hard or lifted up too hard it would prevent the toaster from tilting backwards. Since I wrote that initial review, I have since learned to not push so hard on the lift levers and as a result the toaster remains on all four feet and, therefore, remains firmly on the countertop. For this reason, I am changing the rating to a 5-star. As I earlier said, other than the King of Toaster, the Dualit family of toaster, this is the first toaster that toasts bread very quickly and leaves it crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. That is the way a good piece of toast should be. And it toasts all the bread evenly from end to end, top to bottom, side to side. This is, for the price, a marvelous toaster. Other than the Dualit, the best toaster I have ever had that is sold on the US market. I hope that clarifies this my earlier review. Not very often do I alter a review, but this toaster really makes the grade A and deserves a 5-star rating. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ I know you are going to ask how I could give this toaster a 4-star rating when it’s easy to use, has great value for the money and it’s a great style, I’ll explain. This toaster is a very, very good toaster when it comes to toasting. I don’t know of another toaster that does its job more quickly than this toaster. And, it does it very well. The browning is very even from top to bottom and right to left. In that vein, I have no complaints. However, Amazon does, in its description, mislead us. It states that the weight is 8+ pounds. With no knowledge of the brand except for the good reviews it had, I decided to purchase it along with the fact it was heftier than most non-die-cast toasters such as the Breville models which I have been used to. But the Buydeem weighs in at 4.13 pounds, just a little too light to be valuable as a toaster, especially if children are using it. This toaster does get hot. When I lifted the risers to remove the pieces of bread after they were toasted, the toaster flipped up off the front feet. Worse, when I pushed both risers down to start all four slots toasting, the toaster flipped downward to the counter. In either case, had the toaster been used over and over again, I could have burned my hand. This, for a child, could be—I will say it again—could be a danger. For this reason alone, I am returning the toaster for a model with good reviews that will not flip up or down. It seems to me that a toaster that not only is made in China but is from an actual Chinese company would have weighted it down a little more for safety reasons. I did not see any UL Certification but it may have been..",,69,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AELD623QN2MJQQ2WDDCHAZNQLFJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07S2VVHLF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,BUYDEEM,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QCSK245ZZ08X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07S2VVHLF,B07S2VVHLF

I’ve been using it for half year working well until I saw some smoke whenever I toast. This really scared me so I contact the customer service. And then I met Angel Marcia! She is so patient and helpful to help to solve the problem. She even try to troubleshoot my problem remotely.

I was a little wary about trying this one, because I'd never heard of the brand, but the reviews looked good, so I took a chance. It's turned out to be a really nice toaster. The original unit arrived dented, but the seller took care of that without issue. Here are the things I like about it. 1. It toasts quickly and evenly, and it toasts on the first go. The old B&D often needed a second pass with certain bread types, but not this one. I recommend starting at a lower setting, because at the halfway setting it'll really blacken a slice of white bread. Better to start low, as you can toast bread more, but you can't un-toast it. 2. The metal ""cages"" inside the slots that hold the bread are nice and close together. In the B&D, these were well over an inch apart, so small slices or heels would turn sideways and touch the element (and burn), or get stuck. The Buydeem has less than a 1"" spacing, so it holds each slice way better. No more burnt edges or stuck slices. 3. It's a good looking toaster. 4. I like the cancel button to pop toast up early, rather than having to tug upward on the lever. It's just a little easier. The only downside is that the cleaning trays slide out of the back and not the front, but this is a minor inconvenience. Otherwise, very happy with the toaster.",,71,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFUA6OB6SCWBKSYUGQD36JYUG6EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07S2VVHLF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,BUYDEEM,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XYEDZ0GVMDXZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07S2VVHLF,B07S2VVHLF

I'm using this one exclusively for fresh-baked bagels and Thomas' English muffins, and so far this model does exactly what I want, i.e., it TOASTS without burning, period. I only use the bagels/muffins buttons and I leave the two adjustable control knobs all the way to the left of the dial (their positions don't seem to affect the outcome very much anyway). I read some of the negative reviews of this model: bad smells after the first few uses, uneven toasting, and an ejector that doesn't push the bread upward properly. Before I put anything in the slots, I turned on all four slots with no bread, just to see if the ""burnt plastic smell"" occurred: it didn't and still doesn't after several uses. At the same time I waited a bit to see which side of each slot's heating elements glowed the brightest, which would tell me which side of the bagel or muffin would be toasted thoroughly. Sure enough, my bagels and muffins are consistently toasted on the side with the hottest elements... and no uneven toasting! As far as the complaints about the ejectors not pushing the finished toast far enough upward so the toast can be retrieved without burning one's fingers, I found that giving the ejector lever an extra push upward after ejection worked just fine. Toaster technology (at least for the under-$100 models) is pretty unsophisticated, and so is unlikely to fulfill many users' unrealistic expectations of perfection and instant gratification. Accepting that fact, and using patience and a light touch when operating the admittedly delicate construction of this inexpensive toaster should make for a long and satisfactory relationship with this product. Then again, maybe I just got lucky and bought a non-lemon.",,123,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGFWHRGR2NTJ5GN55YFSKWCXSTIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07S2VVHLF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,BUYDEEM,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OE0DP0VGFPXH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07S2VVHLF,B07S2VVHLF

From the wide slots, to the bagel & muffin options, to the sweet retro appearance, this toaster is a winner! (Yes, I AM excited about a toaster)! Controls are straightforward-the browning controls are advertised as 7 position, but are actually infinitely variable. Engaging the bagel or muffin options are simple (just hold the option button longer for the red light for muffins). The extra lift feature keeps you from having to go fishing with a fork for your food. I especially like the cord length...not too short but not too long and easily wrapped for storage under the toaster. Crumb trays remove easily for easy cleanup. One thing I really appreciate about the Buydeem toaster is consistent results! One run of toast or multiple back to back, the amount of browning remains nearly identical. Many other toasters seem to get confused by residual heat from prior repeated use. The Buydeem does not. The retro appearance in shape and color is truly well done! The rounded lines @ pale turquoise finish add a touch of luxurious simplicity to the kitchen. Did I just use the word ‘luxurious’ to describe a toaster? Dang right I did! 🤣 Additionally, the folks at Buydeem did an excellent job at designing the exterior of the toaster to stay cool while looking great. I’ve attached photos with this review of my results of toast, blueberry bagels, & English muffins prepared in the DT-6B83G toaster-each set to the middle darkness setting and using the bagel or muffin setting as appropriate. All breads were fresh. I’m really pleased! Toast is my ‘perfect’ outcome. Bagels were warm throughout and nicely browned/crisp on the cut side. Muffins, despite not looking browned, were perfectly warmed (easily melting butter) and with a nice crunch to every bite. Again, these were all at mid setting for comparison-you can adjust to suit yourself. Hopefully this review helps you decide if this is the best toaster for your home. I’m very happy with mine in all aspects.",,78,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG3OG4DY4QZFISWRENOBRUADHHLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07S2VVHLF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,BUYDEEM,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NWB7PIJ13PCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07S2VVHLF,B07S2VVHLF

Yes. Absolutely yes. This sexy toaster fit right in my farmhouse style kitchen with it's cool mint green color and retro vibes. I have made toast with it and a toasted sandwich with cream cheese and thin sliced turkey - it was delicious! This toaster pops so quiet I missed it, twice!!! My toast was cold, but then I noticed this amazing thing also has a REHEAT button!!! So no worries if you miss that pop sound. Your roommates won't even hear you make toast in the night.... Pros: Four slots and they are the wide and long type meaning those fancier breads fit without squishing the sides of your slice. It has a bagel setting, as well as that nifty reheat button so your toast doesn't get burnt or overly crispy if you aren't hovering over it and miss it pop up and have to retoast it. The LED lights around the buttons are kind of cool too. It is fairly easy to clean, just dump the tray, so no worries about crumbs or bits of bread burning in the bottom and ruining the perfect taste of your slice. The knobs have a neat texture and are adjustable so you can time it just right for Pop Tarts (2), toast (3.5) or toasted sandwich bread (4). And who really goes past 4 anyways? I mean, the setting is there so you can, but let's face it if you are setting your toast past 4 on the dial you probably should seek out some sort of therapy. If you are using 7 (and it does go up to 7) then mayne you should go to your room and start considering why you hate toast and what it has ever done to you to warrant that. Cons: My husband is a little jealous of how much I love this toaster, and has been asking me if it is better than him. What could I say? I mean it makes TOAST, all he makes is methane gas so... Maybe consider ordering a couples therapy workbook to go with this toaster when purchasing. PS. NO, I am not receiving any promotional consideration for my review of this beautiful toaster I just really, really love it!

Updated review: The seller/manufacturer reached out to me via email after I had already returned the faulty light, they were offering to replace the light. I explained to them that I had already returned the light and already received a refund. They still insisted on sending me a new light, explaining that I must have received a defective light. They were adamant that I receive and test a new light because they stand behind their products and being a small company, word of mouth(reviews) are paramount. I received the new light within a couple days, 1st thing I did to test the light was smack it around on my desk and then proceeded to drop it waist and head high on a carpeted floor. The LED didn't even flicker. I am convinced that the 1st light I received was an outlier and does not represent the majority of their products. What makes me even more confident that this light will be more than adequate for my uses is that the company stands behind their products. 4.5 stars for the light, a great value for $30-ish, (light, 2 rechargable batteries, charger, rail mount, and two switch caps. 5 stars for customer service",,12,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHVKK6J66D4OURJOKUS5GP7K2U2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07VGH8286/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Feyachi,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBLOCCZKE3BV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07VGH8286,B07VGH8286

The pressure switch needs Velcro or other sticky to hold, it’s clunky but I don’t imagine a more expensive option would be better.

When it arrived I was impressed with the overall quality and brightness of the light. As others have stated, this light is a bit bright for indoor use, but great in outdoor situations. When mounted the tail light switch worked flawlessly with a definite click on and off. I was skeptical of the pressure pad switch which seemed spongy in use and did not always work properly when applied. Being a bit disappointed, I put it away for a period of time. When I took the light out at a later date the switch did not work at all. After contacting Feyachi's Customer Service and discussing the situation with Pan I received a new pressure pad switch free of charge.

Not sure exactly when, but I'm still giving it five stars because I contacted customer service and they responded in less than 24 hours saying they would send me a replacement pressure switch immediately. They were very helpful and willing to do what they needed to in order to make it right. I didn't even ask for a free switch. I actually asked if they sold a replacement switch, and they said they'd send a replacement one for free.

The remote on off switch works great so you can enjoy the campfire and not have the light on all the time. The Picatinny rail mount worked great once I figure out how to put a rail on my marshmallow stick using gorilla tape. Haven’t used it to much to know how good battery life is but it is rechargeable. Durability, seems well built, heavy in the hand feels robust. Dropped it a few times in the dirt while eating s’mores and not paying attention but haven’t really abused it yet by burning the end of my marshmallow stick and trying to write my name in the air with the red hot end. Brightness, this is a good bright light. We have some material about 200 feet away and lit up the area quite well.

Great buy","*UPDATE* OK I've had this about 6 months and it does great. Added photos of my back yard. The machinery is about 80-100 yards away and the dog is about 30-40 yards away. I've had this about 3 weeks now and I really like it. For ¼ the price of a stream light I got a pressure pad, mount, 2 batteries and a charger. It's really bright! So for indoors and CQB I'd say this is too bright. Outdoors is where it excels. It will easily light up to 300ft clearly and somewhat light up 500 ft or 0.1 miles. I was unsure buying this but I really like it on my AR15. It's mounted very far forward next to the muzzle brake and the lens has not shattered or anything. I do however reccomend thred locker on the mounting screws and mounting nut. Especially the nut that holds it to the rail. It likes to come loose. My only complaint is that there is no double sided tape or velcro to mount the pressure pad. It also comes with a standard click button rear cap if you do not want to run the pressure switch. The pressure switch its self is dual function. You can have momentarily on or click a button for permanently on. I find that very nice. I reccomend this over a surefire or any name brand for the price. If I ever break this I will definitely buy another. This light does get hot after about 10 mins of continuous use. I've run about 150 rounds through the AR15 with this light and it worked great . Night hunting for animals, I havent shot but have lit up a deer's eyes about 550 to 600 ft off my back porch in the field when my dog got agitated about something in the back yard. I think this is a great white light hunting light for nuisance animals. It doesnt add a lot of weight to the rifle and mounting it to the right side of my rifle I dont notice it is even there.

It slid right onto my rail with no problem. Tightened down with no problems and it stayed tight even after running 50 rounds of 1350 FPS '00' buck and slugs through the Bulldog, slow and rapid fire. No retightening required, after. But of course I did, anyways, because I always do. Don't want hardware falling off at the wrong time. The light is plenty bright: blinded my neighbor at 30 yards and was ""...annoying..."" (his words) and made it so he couldn't see me, at 50 yds, which the Bulldog is sighted in for.

Battery life is about 4 hours. Solid construction. Will update in a couple months to see how it holds up to my AR.

When I tried to turn it on it flickered, but would not turn on, I took the battery out and put it back in and then it turns on fine, I bumped the light with my fist and it turned off again. Taking the battery out and putting it back in made it function. I do have a muzzle brake on my AR and the light might've been mounted a little too close to it. I returned the defective one and got a replacement. I will mount the replacement farther away from my muzzle brake to see if that makes any difference. I don't believe the recoil of my rifle broke the light, I believe it was the concussion of my muzzle brake. I will update this review once I shoot my rifle with the replacement light on (mounted further away from my muzzle brake). _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Been using this light for awhile now, its holding up great, batteries still last a very long time.

Not only are these lights INSANELY bright, they're also focus-adjustable, so you can have a really wide beam or a really tight beam. The pressure switch works well...the only thing that worries me a bit is the cord on the pressure switch (specifically, where it goes into the end cap on the flash light), so we'll see how well that holds up over time with repeated battery changes. And even if it does break, the light comes with a push-button activator cap as well, so you just use that instead and mount the light in a spot on your rifle where you can turn it on with your thumb...definitely not the end of the world. The light is made of some pretty durable aluminum and mounts to 1913 picatinny rail slots. Stays in place like a rock (but don't forget, ALWAYS Loctite EVERYTHING), and it's pretty lightweight so there isn't a noticeable change in inertia when you shoulder or sight your rifle.

This is a top tier flashlight running in a low budget class. Having the light configured with the touch pad switch, you can have a constant beam on/off function or a momentary on/off switch that you can strobe with your of your fingers. Also, with the longer wire attaching the flashlight and touchpad, it allows the touchpad to be placed where the user feels it is most easy to use and comfortable. For me, this is a choice between my foregrip and rails on the opposite side of the light. I had a one problem with the pressure switch and contacted Feyachi through Facebook messenger. They responded very quickly and professionally. I sent them a video of the problem and a new switch arrived on my doorstep one or two days later. The customer service team at Feyachi is top of the line and it shows they care about their customers. The new pressure switch has worked flawlessly and is a newer style than the older one, which seems to be more robust. I would and have recommended this product friends and family or to anyone looking into purchasing a light for their firearms. This light is a fantastic edition to my AR-15 and I do not think I would have it any other way.

The tactical light fit perfectly on the picatinny rail on my Black Aces Tactical Pro semi-auto 12GA. A small amount of glue allowed me to place velcro strips on the fore-end grip to hold the on/off/manual strobe switch in the perfect position.

I guess battery life is good as I don't do night hunting, but having 2 batteries with a charger makes this an even sweeter deal.

I purchased this at 3 AM while I was mostly asleep (along with quite a few other items - sleep-shopping, as it were). I bought it initially thinking it might be useful to mount on on, oh wait, never mind. I ultimately gave it to my beloved wife, who is very particular about many things (not in a bad way). This flashlight falls into the Goldilocks zone - not to large, not too small. The beam is long range enough to pick out skunks at a safe distance (> 100 yards), and the lens is designed so that there is a center long range spot beam and also a softer wider beam for closer range illumination. I cannot speak to battery life yet, and have not owned it long enough to comment on overall durability. The build quality it pretty good and I think it is good value for the money, especially when compared to flashlights that cost 5 times as much or more.

However, I'm pleasantly surprised! Brightness: I'm no expert in lumens. But this light is going to cause a target to be disoriented for sure. It's brighter than any other light I've owned. Durability: Seems like it'd hold up well against light to moderate impact. But full disclosure, I only just received and mounted it today. UPDATE 4/12/20: The light began to malfunction. Feyachi customer service is absolutely wonderful. They are taking excellent care of me! 4/22: They replaced the entire light for free! Size: It's short, which makes it more difficult to prevent the barrel-shadow when mounted to a weapon (depending on your weapon), but I love the size because it keeps it lightweight. Looks: Honestly, this is just a great looking light on a weapon. I love the matte black finish. The switch remote: This is what I was most worried about based on some other reviews. While I agree that the switch isn't ""high"" quality, it certainly is far above the garbage grade it received from some other reviewers. For a $33 light that comes with a weapon mount and a switch, I'm pleased and impressed! Mount: Easy to mount to the standard picatinny rail. It's offset as well, which I like. 4/12/2020: CUSTOMER SERVICE: It's clear that Feyachi wants satisfied customers. Pan in customer service is taking AMAZING care of me. Highly recommended!

It comes with 2 end caps. One allows you to carry this as a regular flashlight. The other is connected via cable and has a mountable switch that allows for an on/off finger switch as well as a momentary switch. I mounted mine on the side of my fore grip handle and it works great. I love the momentary switch function. The switch itself is rather large and can be activated from pretty much anywhere along the length of the switch. This means I don’t have to try to situate my finger(s) on just one point. I grab the handle, my fingers wrap around and (almost) fall perfectly on the momentary switch. Pretty close to a perfect setup. As usual with anything like this, the mounting of the switch is problematic. Double sided tape does not hold well, and certainly not for any duration of time. There isn’t a lot of room on either end to grab on to, so I used a combination of things. I used removable 3M double sided adhesive under the switch (my handle has a cutout for a light switch). I then took electrical tape and wrapped it around the top of the switch, where the cable goes in. This gives it a lot of stability, still blends in, and, in a pinch, gives me a little extra electrical tape I can remove if I need it somewhere else. This light is super bright. The charging process takes a little bit (it says quick charger on it, but I’m not convinced it is). But, it comes with 2 batteries and they seem to keep their charge for a decent amount of time. I have not done a test yet to see exactly how long they last, but since I prefer the momentary bursts of light over the on/off switch, I imagine I’ll get a lot more use out of each battery. The light is not zoom-able and has no other functions (medium, low, strobe, etc). It is just full on or off in either constant on/off or momentary via the momentary switch. For me and for what I wanted, this light is perfect! One thing I almost forgot - when I first plugged the battery in and left it to charge, I came back several hours later (description says 3 hour charge time). After checking on it at 3 hours, then 4 hours, and then 5 hours, I went to pull the battery out to see if it was seated properly. As soon as I touched the battery, the light on the charger turned green. I let go of it, and the light went back to red. I decided to turn (spin) the battery in the charger and the red light flickered between red and green. I decided to switch batteries and the next battery charged for a few hours and then went green on its own. When I put the first battery back in, it did the red/green dance again. Not sure if this is a charger problem or what, but the battery is in the flashlight and has been working fine, so I assume the charger just has a problem with it’s indicator somehow.",,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEC6GLXRO4DAK2EWHBHUSK6A523A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07VGH8286/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Feyachi,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16BIKFXEQB8EJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07VGH8286,B07VGH8286

I went to a few airsoft games and it is very durable, the glass didn’t break when it got hit and there were no skid marks on the metal. Shooting with this sight at the gun range and realigning the sight-line was easy as it can get, it’s very comfortable to deal with and it’s not too hard to put on or takeoff the rail the only problem I have with the sight is it has no ON and OFF switch/button witch is ok though because of the price I got 16.68 USD and the two batteries it comes with is a great. It’s not too hard to switch them out after using. it was an amazing sight and price 10/10 would buy again as a gift for a friend or if the sight ever breaks but I don’t see that happening anytime soon because of the durably! so far it’s Seems to be water resistant I went out in the rain with it it didn’t seem to fry it or sort Circuit but at one point while I was shooting at the range it turned off randomly and I thought it was the battery so I took it out and put it back in just to be sure and it turned right back on after that, i haven’t experience any real problems with the battery throughout my experience. but i do I love the different levels of radicals but there's only one I really use is the circle with the plus and the dot in the middle and it’s really nice to have low light levels and high levels also I really like how you can unscrew the rail all the way off your gun without the rail on the sight falling off which is a neat feature. I drop this thing in mud I think twice when I was at a airsoft match after I cleaned it off it seem to be OK, it holds up pretty well against .20g BBs there’s no marks on it or scratched paint but I do wish it came in different colors like tan and Woodland green or a light green but at the end of the day you’re getting more for your dollar which is amazing I do wish that they would make a A mesh screen protector for it tho Price it at like five or six bucks that would be amazing because from the front it is very shiny it’s almost like a beacon staying over here !",,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGNT6P5D6Y2BVAF5MBDIFBPJVYBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WR9FQWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Feyachi,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26XBFDTNZODQJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WR9FQWQ,B07WR9FQWQ

For some situations, this will be less convenient than if it had a slotted screw that could be turned with readily available objects (e.g., the rim of a cartridge). More thorough instructions would be helpful for less experienced users. For example, the manual does not mention that the locking screw must be loosened before making elevation or windage adjustments. Another important feature is durability, but I haven't had it long enough to know. Only time will tell.

I bought this and a few competitors based on Amazon reviews and it was a big step up from other budget reticles. The closest competitor is the RS-29, but there are pros and cons between them. I have multiple platforms on which I tried them (and others) and I really like the RS-30, overall. First off, the images were clear. I had two other models that had blurry images in the viewing windows, regardless of relief depth. This and the RS-29 are both clear and the projected images were sharp. Next, the controls were both intuitive and smooth. The press-button on/of is a bit different from a dial but it was easy to do by feel. Both the control button and the image selector are both smooth to operate. The color options and variations in images are pretty standard but at least all of the bases are covered. I really- REALLY - wish it also went green. I almost passed on this because I like the green dot over red but with the coated glass and the clear picture I quickly got past the single color option. The weight is on par with other similar open reticles, though the thicker lens and full shade hood added a few 1/10ths over the RS-29. Using it was great. Kids adapted to it quickly and were able to keep both eyes open, which helped them be relaxed when using it. It held zero over 250 cycles and was easy to get dialed in the first time.

I didn't want to spend over $200 on a name-brand optic since this is for a pellet gun I have on my front porch to keep neighborhood cats away - so I took a chance on this cheap knockoff. Been shooting it a couple weeks now. I usually go out every morning and plink a few rounds at targets with my coffee. Holds zero pretty well. Especially for what I paid for it. Some things other reviews said that are true: the battery that comes with it will die on you within 10 minutes of using it. However - they include another battery and that one seems to be a better quality because 2 weeks of shooting it daily and still hasn't died yet. So I suspect the installed battery is just a ""demo battery"" or something. Also - the crosshair reticle is tilted a little to the left. Not dramatically. Maybe 5 degrees. It doesn't seem to hurt the aim - just looks a little weird. I find myself using the red-dot reticle anyway just because it's no so big and gaudy looking.

I received the package on time and the sight was packed in a small but efficient well padded box that did a very good job of protecting the sight during shipping. When I unpackaged the sight I was impressed by how well made the sight felt. I have several reflex sights from the eotech and holosun, to a trijicon and this sight impressed me immediately for the price. I already had a 16” 5.56 rifle set up for it That It mounted up nicely On with no problems. The sight is low profile and has an aesthetically pleasing design. I was able to bore sight the sight and get it close enough to finish dialing it in at the range. Once at the range the sight zeroed easily and seemed to hold zero through all 1000 rounds we fired. The glass is very clear for the cost of the sight. I like the different options for reticles that come stock as well as the brightness options. I also like that it takes a very popular easy to find battery size. One thing I was not able to determine as I have not had the sight for long enough is the battery run time. I have had not been able to run the battery out since I purchased the sight. Another feature that I like about the sight is that it has the absolute cowitness ability with stock sights. Time will tell how this sight holds up but I am very happy with my purchase and will buy another one for my truck rifle. This sight is a very nice sight for the price point and overall has far surpassed my expectations.

B07WR9FQWQ,"Feyachi RS-30 Reflex Sight, Multiple Reticle System Red Dot Sight with Picatinny Rail Mount, Absolute Co-Witness",4.3,476,Richard Harrold,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"April 17, 2020",United States,You won't be disappointed.,"First of all, I like this reflex sight. It’s size, weight, stout construction, functionality, and price is hard to beat. The field of view is more than adequate for fast target acquisition, plus various reticle brightness settings allow preferences in different light conditions. Combined with a variety of reticle choices and the fore mentioned features, it’s very hard to outclass this sight given its price range. And it looks cool on an AR-15 or variant rifle. Has to look cool. As rifle owners and builders add components, functionality and gadgets to their builds, rifle weight increases. Personally, I’m concerned with weight. However, weight aside, besides the rifle itself, the sighting system is critical in the build. The sight must function according to the shooters requirements and provide accurate placement at various ranges. The RS-30 in my opinion provides excellent sighting in a compact, lightweight, easy to use package that doesn’t add unnecessary functionality and weight, such as lasers. Sighting in the reticle is accomplished using the provided wrenches. Reticle lock down is provided. Regardless of eye position, the retical holds target adequately. Iron backup sights work exceptional well through the lens. Construction is robust. The hood is stout providing a glare shield and should protect the lens area quite well. Rail attachment is good given the overall weight and profile of the sight. This is all accomplished by not creating a huge lump on top of a rifle keeping the overall profile of an AR-15 quite low and attractive. Looks cool. My opinion’ a good job Feyachi. Electronics provide the on-off button location for a right-hand shooter’s support hand operation. Strong side left hand shooters should be able to adapt to this location with practice. The reticle selection lever is located in a protected position however easy to reach and adjust. Battery storage is good plus provides a coin operated cover for easy removal. Batteries are readily available at local stores I’ve not tested the one-hour auto-power shut-off feature. Battery removal may need to be revisited. To my Feyachi friends, a couple of suggestions to improve on an already good sight. My suggestions would no-doubt add price to the optic however would significantly increase the reliability, desirability and overall functionality of the optic. This optic can compete with much more expensive optics. First, a positive ‘click’ positioning lever on the reticle selection feature would insert the reticle precisely in the lens eliminating minor adjustments to center the reticle Second, windage and elevation adjustments would be more convenient with coin operated adjustment screw; currently the operator must always have the adjustment wrench available. Watch out for painted directions on the optic as some builders paint their rifles. Third, add a quick rail attach or detach feature protected from unintended release. Lastly, and no-doubt the most costly improvement is providing some degree of waterproofing to the electronics and lens. Given the existing sight and with these improvements, I would not have an issue paying more. Plus this sight could complete with optics costing hundreds of dollars more. Thank you for the opportunity to provide you my personal feedback to your RS-30 Reflex sight.",,1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQ2AYPWWLLLIAZSZS673J2NNU5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WR9FQWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Feyachi,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K264309G57PX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WR9FQWQ,B07WR9FQWQ

Tremendous value.,"Let me start off with saying I love testing these budget friendly options of sights. I've been involved in the firearms community over 17 years now. I worked with training companies and shops. I've handled everything from bottom of the barrel, to the top of the line. I've tested several products from feyachi, this sight by far is an the absolute cherry of the feyachi offerings. I've had a few units in the past with some reticle issues. I must say feyachi's customer service is second to none. They've always without hesitation taken care of any issues. That in itself is worth 5 stars. Pan has been an absolute pleasure deal with and their customer service cannot be beat. This sight is SOLID! I will list the pros and cons below. Pros : - This unit is rock solid. With budget optics it's tough to find something of quality. Is this an eotech? No, not by any stretch, but It's also not $500. - I love the switch on this unit. It has the 4 way reticle selection at the rear, and a simple on and off button on the left side. I've never really like the rotating dials commonly found on these types of sights. I really like how it has the intensity control built into the button.A quick push and you can manual cycle through 6 different options. 1 is fairly dim, but 6 is super bright even in direct sunlight. You press to turn on, click to adjust brightness and press and hold to shut off. I haven't had a chance to test, but this unit supposedly turns itself off after an hour of time if it's not moved around. I cannot confirm that as of yet. - The adjustments on the unit have a firm and positive click, and lock solidly into place. This fit perfect on the rail system on an AR pistol, with little to no wiggle or play. The reticle selector is firm and positive when you switch through the options, but still very easy to engage. The power button is a positive click when pushed. Overall a very solid unit. This also cowitnesses perfectly. - The size is just about perfect. This is pretty small and low profile for what it is. I think some people may find it a bit small, but it's just right in my opinion. Alot of value in a compact package. - This unit has a small rear sight built right into the rear part of the unit. It cannot be adjusted. I thought this was just an awesome addition to this sight. It's very rare that on the unit itself there is a way to have a backup. I have not tested accuracy of it yet, but absolutely love the concept. It should help you in a pinch if you have no rear back up option. - The reticle selection. Oh the reticle selection. Four great options. Each option is super crisp and clear. I had 4 people look at it to tell me what they thought of the clarity. 3 said fantastic, one said fuzzy. It seems very dependent on if you have an eye issues like astigmatism, or corrective lenses. No issues, but something to keep in mind. They varying intensity is fantastic. - I love that the adjustment Allen wrenches and an extra battery is included. This comes with everything you need to throw it on, tighten it down, power it on, adjust, and clean it. Fantastic value. - I also love the lens coating. It seemed to work really well at keeping down glare, it also makes it look pretty incredible! Cons : Honestly I dont have many cons to list here, I'd say its more nitpicks than anything else. - The finish isnt the best. The unit arrive safely and packaged well. My unit had some chipping on some of the edges. Minor for me, but I thought it was noteworthy. A dot of sharpie or black paint would take care of that in short order. My unit also has a small, almost rubbing kind of wear on one spot on the rear. The item I recieved was all factory sealed and in brand new condition. I could only assume it was maybe from handling in the factory. Very minor. - The hardware to attach was a little gritty. Some oil and running the screws in and out a few times took care of that quickly aswell, again, not a problem, but I thought it was noteworthy. I had no issues with soft or stripping screw heads or anything like that. - The reticles, while bright and crisp, have the slightest counterclockwise lean going on. It's not perfectly vertical, just every so slightly tilted to the left. I don't forsee it being an issue, but did notice it. Also as mentioned above. Four people looking at the reticles. Three said they were crisp, one said they were fuzzy. It seems dependent on if you have any eye issues or wear corrective lenses. All in all, this sight is a solid purchase. This will be going on an AR chambered in 300 AAC. I will come back to update as it sees some use. I cant speak to longevity or reliability at this point. If your looking for a budget optic, this is the one to buy in my opinion. With those minor nitpicks aside, this thing is of good quality, it feels solid, and the reticle selection and brightness are really stellar. I would highly reccomend this sight, and give this 5 stars. It's a tremendous value, and it has many features found on sights upward of the $90-$100 mark. Well above its similarly priced competitors. You wont be dissappinted, and in the off chance you are, Feyachi's awesome customer service team will be more than happy to take care of you.",,1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCN3TVXN2IGKNWK6VHUDFNEO3KA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WR9FQWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Feyachi,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PNI0F0VWG95P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WR9FQWQ,B07WR9FQWQ

Mounting is simple as it fits any standard picatinny rail. The reticle is clear and bright. The lowest setting is fine in low light. I used it in bright sunlight on the highest setting and had no problem quickly acquiring the target. There are 4 reticles. I shot with all four of them and saw no shift in point of impact when switching between them. Accuracy is perfectly fine. It’s a red dot, not a precision scope. It’s quick to place on target and has a fine enough dot to not cover too much target area. I fired 500 rounds with the sight attached and found no shift in impact and no loosening of the base. Overall, I am very satisfied. I ran through a bunch of drills and practiced transitioning between multiple targets. The sight is great for fast target acquisition and allows you to keep both eyes open for quick transitions. One nice thing I wasn’t expecting is the solid click of the power button.

It was easy to install and came with the tools to do so, so no extra purchases were necessary. I really like that the brightness of the sight can also be adjusted to fit different lighting conditions. I couldnt find much to dislike about this product except that a couple of the sight projections are not perfectly straight by a couple degrees, but it's not a big deal to me as I usually use the crosshairs that are round and don't have straight lines. Overall I think this is product is perfect for what I need it for. I don't do a lot of shooting outdoors or in harsh weather conditions.

B07WR9FQWQ,"Feyachi RS-30 Reflex Sight, Multiple Reticle System Red Dot Sight with Picatinny Rail Mount, Absolute Co-Witness",4.3,476,Carolina Gun Guy,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"September 13, 2019",United States,Great sight for what I paid,"Overall, I'm giving this red dot sight 5 stars, but only because there's not a 4.5 stars option. See below for my pros, cons, and summary. Pros: - Seems to be a quality build, with all metal parts except (ironically) the built-in iron sight. - Includes (forementioned) rear iron sight. - Great price for the quality that you get. - Adjustable reticle, with four options. - Quality mount built in. - Batteries included (including spare). Cons: - Parallax is an issue. Tested from 3yds to 15yds, the point of impact changes based on where you look through the sight window. On many red dot sights where parallax is an issue, it becomes a non-issue at 50+ yds; I didn't test it this far out. - Slightly uneven reticles, most noticeable on the star one at the far left; the points are not exactly horizontal/vertical. Summary: So why 5 stars with the obvious parallax issue? Because this is a $44 sight. Parallax free sights are going to cost in the hundreds, not in the tens. I wouldn't recommend this sight for any situation in which precision is an absolute necessity, but then again, you wouldn't be buying this sight if absolute precision was a requirement. It's absolutely great for the price, and I recommend if you're looking for a casual red dot sight for your gun.",,243,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFWQZNLT6Q7HW3NGFNJAQXF6KSLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WR9FQWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Feyachi,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R158O6UJHE8641/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WR9FQWQ,B07WR9FQWQ

Horvath,,Verified Purchase,,,,5,"April 24, 2020",United States,Great scope for a great price.,"I just received my Feyachi RS-30 Relex scope today. With my aging eyes my intent was to get a relatively inexpensive red dot scope to mount on my Ruger 1022. I have had some good experiences with a Feyachi’s RDS-22 scope on a Glock 22 fitted with a MCK so I was looking forward to the RS-30. The RS-30 mounted easily to my Ruger’s picatinny rail with the included scope mount. Also included were allen wrenches for installation and adjustment and a complete second set of batteries. Although I have yet to take it to the range, a quick co-witness with the existing metal sights suggests the new red dot is fairly close to zero. For the price the RS-30 has some nice features. There are 4 reticle patterns: dot within a circle, dot within a cross, solitary dot and finally, dot within a circle within a cross. Each of these patterns have 6 brightness settings. Setting 4 seemed the best for me. The pattern is turned on by pressing the on switch. Pressing the switch briefly cycles through the brightness setting. Holding the switch down for a couple of seconds turns off the reticle. Additionally, to preserve battery life, the sight will turn itself off after one hour of inactivity. A nice feature is that the scope remembers your last pattern and brightness setting so when you turn it back on you are set to go. The reticle itself is large and easily lends itself to shooting with both eyes open. If you are hunting this allows you to remain situationally aware while providing a clear sight picture. The fit and finish of the scope itself is beyond expectations, particularly given the price point. I look forward to getting to the range and putting this scope through it’s paces. Given my experience with the RDS-22 I do not anticipate any issues.",,28,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCQWNWZE2ATREUVDCHZT7CCW5OA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WR9FQWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Feyachi,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9WN3HJ7B033E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07WR9FQWQ,B07WR9FQWQ

I can not get over how easy it is to use. I would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a good sight. I have several other products from this company and customer service is excellent. I am convinced that this company wants their products to work for you. Two month later...I have been using this, a number of people at the range have used it.

I should add if you are a Gun Snob, this Red Dot is not for you or your friends. For me, mounted on a side mount of a Serbian AK, this Red Dot exceed all my expectations for this lower priced sight. Anyone who knows AK's, knows that the side mounts & amplified shock from the recoil of this rifle, destroys most lower priced optics. 7 Magazines & 210 rounds later, I was out of ammo, my armpit was a little tender(I have got to shoot more) & this Red Dot was still holding aero & functioning perfect. When I get another rifle, this is one of my top choices for a optic.

I literally started my hair at 10pm the day I received it - I couldn't wait to use it. Took me about a 1hour and 20 min. Pretty typical to my curl time. Previously had been looking at the L'ange waver - I just can't bring my self to pay 100 on sale and norm 179.00. For something like that. Very very happy with this product. Went to sleep and hair still is holding shape .

I did more of a crimpy pattern in the photo, but I've also done the wave pattern too and it's beautiful. I do waves by putting the the tool directly on the next section of hair that the last ""wave"" pattern ended. I do crimpy style by clamping the hair tool on each section of hair in 3 or 4 different places, about an inch or 2 apart from each other.

Lots of waves.,"So far I really like product. Easy to use. Heats up fast. There's even a turbo button. Very good quality. It really only took about 15 mins for my first try. My waves really last a 12 hr switch. The tool gave my hair lots of volume. Normally my hair is thin and straight, no volume at all. I left heat on hair for about 8 secs. It's lightweight and easy to hold. Be careful it does heat up fast and continues to keep heart. I didn't even have to use any product on my hair. I probably would not keep on surface. I would raise it or put on a towel. Don't put directly on surface. It would burn counters. Perfect for short hair.

My camping situation: We camped in North Texas in October. It was pretty cold in the evenings (about 40 degrees) and the tent was a bit chilly at times. The main reason for this was that the vented area at the top of the tent does not completely close. I know this is not a design unique to this tent, but in 40 degrees and 20mph winds, I think it makes a big difference. However, having said that, the tent held up incredible well considering the punishing winds it endured. We had all stakes put out and the tent never faltered or ripped or flattened even though I'm pretty sure there were occasional gusts of up to 40mph. Sadly I did not get a chance to see how the tent did in the rain as it was dry our entire trip right up until the morning of the last day. By then we'd already torn the tent down to begin packing. Overall I think the tent did really well and I might have pushed it a bit beyond what it was designed for in temperatures, but I was really impressed. The seams seem strong and the zippers do as well. It's easy to put up and down, even in the challenging wind and it's pretty light for as large as it opens up to.

Great value.,"This was my first tent (and camping experience) and it went better than expected. The tent was very easy to assemble and the instructions are stitched into the packing bag so you never lose them (although after the first time assembling it you pretty much know how to do it again without the instructions). The space was perfect for our family of four, two adults and two kids. We had to install the rain cover because it was showing to rain and the tent protected us from water. It was pretty windy out, but the tent was solid. I liked that it had ventilation from two sides so the air could flow across the inside of the tent keeping the air inside fresh. A nice surprise was the little see-through pouch hanging from the inside of the tent which I assumed were for shoes, but we used it to put our cell phones in.

I’ve purchased countless different teepees & hated each one of them for different reasons- too small, tip over easily (my boys are wild), cheap quality etc. So when I saw this 6 person tent for under $100 with great reviews, I figured I’d give it a shot. Took it out of the package & had it assembled within 5 minutes. Super easy & nice quality. I ordered a 6x9 grey shag rug to make it a comfy area for them to lay & play and it fit perfectly. They absolutely LOVE their new “fort” & have been relaxing in there all day. Very happy with my purchase. It’s exactly what I had hoped for! I can’t speak to how well it will hold up outside, because we obviously are not using it for that at this time, but it seems well made & sturdy. Oh & did I mention that it’s SUPER lightweight & comes in a very compact carrying bag?! Perfect for camping trips where you have 50 million other things to carry. Don’t hesitate, just buy it!

Lugging tents around has never been a problem, but I can appreciate it when a good tent comes along. So is this good? The answer is yes. This tent isn't the lightest tent, but its lighter than similar tents at the big box stores or the blue store. The tent manages this by having thinner shock rods. The tent stills sets up solid though, and it did well when I set it up in the back yard when it was pretty gusty with 15mph winds yesterday. Good! The tent is a three seasons tent. The top half is mosquito netting, but we don't have bugs this time of year so I can't really test that out. The door is the normal door-and-screen job. The tent does have two windows in the back, but it does not have a second door. If you want two doors for your two person tents, you want another tent. The people in the tent sleep N/S and the door and window are E/W, so someone has to climb over someone else for late night bathroom breaks. On the other hand, this tent is super comfy sleeping one person, and it's light enough to carry like that. I generally like tents which have two doors but it's personal preference. The guy lines are also reflective on mine, which is great, because I got it to go scout camping. People won't trip over them in the night. The rainfly is also good, it's made of a different material than the tent and it's very waterproof from me leaving it up overnight. Lots and lots of venting which is good even with the windows shut. Water in the tent makes it heavy and makes gear not be warm, so getting the condensation out of the tent is super important. I'm really happy with it, we'll see if it survives boyscouts this year.",,134,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBHFXDYMWKTKXVFSFEY4T7LGO4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YTFPM1L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,MOON LENCE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CEZ2T4UOMHMZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YTFPM1L,B07YTFPM1L

A strong rod is attached to the roof tarpaulin in 2 eyelets and fixed in the middle with a ribbon. All in all, tent is sewn clean, nothing sticks out and the seams are sealed with a transparent tape on the inside. So it can't get wet from rain inside.

I just bring in my laptop. I can't vouch for the water resistance, since it wasn't raining when we used it (so far just once) but here's my experience: I unpacked it. The directions were pretty easy. I'm sure I'll put it together in half the time in the future since I now know how to do it, but it literally only took me about 10 minutes, and that was with stopping a lot to read the instructions. I think the rain cover was actually more difficult for me to figure out and took longer to install than the actual tent, but now I know how to do it. This tent can be put up with rain cover in 5 minutes once you know what you're doing. It's VERY lightweight, comes in a small carry bag. Since we only used it on the deck, we didn't need to use the stakes for tying it down, but they are included. It's is sturdy enough for what we're using it for and appears to be well made. There was plenty of room inside for us to relax on a pile of pillows in front of the laptop with 2 small dogs and snacks. We carried it indoors without taking it apart, because with a person on each end, you can ""fold"" the tent flat bringing the poles together. If you wanted to use it on the ground, I'd probably recommend a tarp because any sharp sticks or rocks may rip the material, plus you'd feel them. The bottom of the tent is very thin, made of the same material as the rest of the tent. Over all, we love it, it's easy, light weight, easily transported, even carried while assembled, has a removable rain cover so you can enjoy the stars on a clear night. Well worth the price. I'm happy with it. UPDATE: I put the tent on the back deck again for another movie night ""campout"" with my daughter. I left it there overnight to continue the next day. I got up in the morning and it was gone. It was VERY windy, and I didn't have it tied down, so it turns out it blew away. It crossed my yard, flew over my fence, tumbled across the street, around a huge tree, past three more properties and over another chain link fence where I found it in someone's back yard. The rope had caught on the fence and stopped it from going further, so I was able to fish it back over the fence. I carried it back home on my back, wind still blowing hard, filling the still erected tent with air like a kite, and nearly carrying me away with it. I'm a little embarrassed to think neighbors might have saw me, a middle aged woman carrying a fully erected tent on my back, turning me into a human kite on a windy day. I put it back on my deck, this time tying it down, and wouldn't you know it, it didn't even have a single rip in it. Still in PERFECT condition after the ordeal it went through! I love this tent.",,38,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCBG2IWO6TSXU52F6K7NASU263A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YTFPM1L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,MOON LENCE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22TO9UXJKAKEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YTFPM1L,B07YTFPM1L

There are a couple of panels that unzip and can be rolled up and secured so you have a screened ""window"" for light and airflow. The support rods were easy to put in place with the clip/hook system although I was used to seeing ones that thread through a little fabric channel along the diagonals of the tent. Anyway, the whole thing is a win. If you are looking for a super durable, heavy duty tent and/or need one light enough to hike with, I can't speak to this tent's ability to handle those needs. (I also wouldn't try to sleep more than 2 adults in the tent.) But it worked great for a quick overnight with 2 adults in mild weather.",,38,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFEBVYOHLS2BXA6CNTULVEAZ62PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YTFZGH1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,MOON LENCE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16JMOPRGF3AAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YTFZGH1,B07YTFZGH1

My camping situation: We camped in North Texas in October. It was pretty cold in the evenings (about 40 degrees) and the tent was a bit chilly at times. The main reason for this was that the vented area at the top of the tent does not completely close. I know this is not a design unique to this tent, but in 40 degrees and 20mph winds, I think it makes a big difference. However, having said that, the tent held up incredible well considering the punishing winds it endured. We had all stakes put out and the tent never faltered or ripped or flattened even though I'm pretty sure there were occasional gusts of up to 40mph. Sadly I did not get a chance to see how the tent did in the rain as it was dry our entire trip right up until the morning of the last day. By then we'd already torn the tent down to begin packing. Overall I think the tent did really well and I might have pushed it a bit beyond what it was designed for in temperatures, but I was really impressed. The seams seem strong and the zippers do as well. It's easy to put up and down, even in the challenging wind and it's pretty light for as large as it opens up to. I think my sons and I will get considerable use out of it.",,1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGQU4WKW4LVDBALHC6HBWXAR35BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YTFZGH1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,MOON LENCE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KUAMJ25NAPAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YTFZGH1,B07YTFZGH1

Took it out of the package & had it assembled within 5 minutes. Super easy & nice quality. I ordered a 6x9 grey shag rug to make it a comfy area for them to lay & play and it fit perfectly.

I just bring in my laptop. I can't vouch for the water resistance, since it wasn't raining when we used it (so far just once) but here's my experience: I unpacked it. The directions were pretty easy. I'm sure I'll put it together in half the time in the future since I now know how to do it, but it literally only took me about 10 minutes, and that was with stopping a lot to read the instructions. I think the rain cover was actually more difficult for me to figure out and took longer to install than the actual tent, but now I know how to do it. This tent can be put up with rain cover in 5 minutes once you know what you're doing. It's VERY lightweight, comes in a small carry bag. Since we only used it on the deck, we didn't need to use the stakes for tying it down, but they are included. It's is sturdy enough for what we're using it for and appears to be well made. There was plenty of room inside for us to relax on a pile of pillows in front of the laptop with 2 small dogs and snacks. We carried it indoors without taking it apart, because with a person on each end, you can ""fold"" the tent flat bringing the poles together. If you wanted to use it on the ground, I'd probably recommend a tarp because any sharp sticks or rocks may rip the material, plus you'd feel them. The bottom of the tent is very thin, made of the same material as the rest of the tent. Over all, we love it, it's easy, light weight, easily transported, even carried while assembled, has a removable rain cover so you can enjoy the stars on a clear night. Well worth the price. I'm happy with it. UPDATE: I put the tent on the back deck again for another movie night ""campout"" with my daughter. I left it there overnight to continue the next day. I got up in the morning and it was gone. It was VERY windy, and I didn't have it tied down, so it turns out it blew away. It crossed my yard, flew over my fence, tumbled across the street, around a huge tree, past three more properties and over another chain link fence where I found it in someone's back yard. The rope had caught on the fence and stopped it from going further, so I was able to fish it back over the fence. I carried it back home on my back, wind still blowing hard, filling the still erected tent with air like a kite, and nearly carrying me away with it. I'm a little embarrassed to think neighbors might have saw me, a middle aged woman carrying a fully erected tent on my back, turning me into a human kite on a windy day. I put it back on my deck, this time tying it down, and wouldn't you know it, it didn't even have a single rip in it. Still in PERFECT condition after the ordeal it went through!

Lugging tents around has never been a problem, but I can appreciate it when a good tent comes along. So is this good? The answer is yes. This tent isn't the lightest tent, but its lighter than similar tents at the big box stores or the blue store. The tent manages this by having thinner shock rods. The tent stills sets up solid though, and it did well when I set it up in the back yard when it was pretty gusty with 15mph winds yesterday. Good! The tent is a three seasons tent. The top half is mosquito netting, but we don't have bugs this time of year so I can't really test that out. The door is the normal door-and-screen job. The tent does have two windows in the back, but it does not have a second door. If you want two doors for your two person tents, you want another tent. The people in the tent sleep N/S and the door and window are E/W, so someone has to climb over someone else for late night bathroom breaks. On the other hand, this tent is super comfy sleeping one person, and it's light enough to carry like that. I generally like tents which have two doors but it's personal preference. The guy lines are also reflective on mine, which is great, because I got it to go scout camping. People won't trip over them in the night. The rainfly is also good, it's made of a different material than the tent and it's very waterproof from me leaving it up overnight. Lots and lots of venting which is good even with the windows shut. Water in the tent makes it heavy and makes gear not be warm, so getting the condensation out of the tent is super important. I'm really happy with it, we'll see if it survives boyscouts this year.",,134,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBHFXDYMWKTKXVFSFEY4T7LGO4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YTFZGH1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,MOON LENCE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CEZ2T4UOMHMZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YTFZGH1,B07YTFZGH1

We weren't looking for something super light for hiking with or super durable for long term, frequent use in demanding conditions. For $50 this tent easily surpassed our expectations with thoughtful design details and surprisingly good construction. The tent features an internal cargo pocket for your odds and ends and a nice hook at the top for hanging up a battery powered light. There are a couple of panels that unzip and can be rolled up and secured so you have a screened ""window"" for light and airflow. The support rods were easy to put in place with the clip/hook system although I was used to seeing ones that thread through a little fabric channel along the diagonals of the tent. Anyway, the whole thing is a win. If you are looking for a super durable, heavy duty tent and/or need one light enough to hike with, I can't speak to this tent's ability to handle those needs.

My camping situation: We camped in North Texas in October. It was pretty cold in the evenings (about 40 degrees) and the tent was a bit chilly at times. The main reason for this was that the vented area at the top of the tent does not completely close. I know this is not a design unique to this tent, but in 40 degrees and 20mph winds, I think it makes a big difference. However, having said that, the tent held up incredible well considering the punishing winds it endured. We had all stakes put out and the tent never faltered or ripped or flattened even though I'm pretty sure there were occasional gusts of up to 40mph. Sadly I did not get a chance to see how the tent did in the rain as it was dry our entire trip right up until the morning of the last day. By then we'd already torn the tent down to begin packing. Overall I think the tent did really well and I might have pushed it a bit beyond what it was designed for in temperatures, but I was really impressed. The seams seem strong and the zippers do as well. It's easy to put up and down, even in the challenging wind and it's pretty light for as large as it opens up to.

Lugging tents around has never been a problem, but I can appreciate it when a good tent comes along. So is this good? The answer is yes. This tent isn't the lightest tent, but its lighter than similar tents at the big box stores or the blue store. The tent manages this by having thinner shock rods. The tent stills sets up solid though, and it did well when I set it up in the back yard when it was pretty gusty with 15mph winds yesterday. Good! The tent is a three seasons tent. The top half is mosquito netting, but we don't have bugs this time of year so I can't really test that out. The door is the normal door-and-screen job. The tent does have two windows in the back, but it does not have a second door. If you want two doors for your two person tents, you want another tent. The people in the tent sleep N/S and the door and window are E/W, so someone has to climb over someone else for late night bathroom breaks. On the other hand, this tent is super comfy sleeping one person, and it's light enough to carry like that. I generally like tents which have two doors but it's personal preference. The guy lines are also reflective on mine, which is great, because I got it to go scout camping. People won't trip over them in the night. The rainfly is also good, it's made of a different material than the tent and it's very waterproof from me leaving it up overnight. Lots and lots of venting which is good even with the windows shut. Water in the tent makes it heavy and makes gear not be warm, so getting the condensation out of the tent is super important. I'm really happy with it, we'll see if it survives boyscouts this year.",,134,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBHFXDYMWKTKXVFSFEY4T7LGO4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YTKN446/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,MOON LENCE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CEZ2T4UOMHMZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YTKN446,B07YTKN446

A strong rod is attached to the roof tarpaulin in 2 eyelets and fixed in the middle with a ribbon.

Took it out of the package & had it assembled within 5 minutes. Super easy & nice quality. I ordered a 6x9 grey shag rug to make it a comfy area for them to lay & play and it fit perfectly. They absolutely LOVE their new “fort” & have been relaxing in there all day. Very happy with my purchase. It’s exactly what I had hoped for! I can’t speak to how well it will hold up outside, because we obviously are not using it for that at this time, but it seems well made & sturdy.

Disassembling it was even easier, taking less than 5 minutes for only one person. It's not an ultralight tent for backpacking/backcountry but it is lightweight enough to carry through a campground. I can't attest to how waterproof it is because I don't intend to use this outside of a lean-to. Can't wait to use it in 2 weeks! EDIT: Used it during our camping trip. Worked perfectly for our needs.

I just bring in my laptop. I can't vouch for the water resistance, since it wasn't raining when we used it (so far just once) but here's my experience: I unpacked it. The directions were pretty easy. I'm sure I'll put it together in half the time in the future since I now know how to do it, but it literally only took me about 10 minutes, and that was with stopping a lot to read the instructions. I think the rain cover was actually more difficult for me to figure out and took longer to install than the actual tent, but now I know how to do it. This tent can be put up with rain cover in 5 minutes once you know what you're doing. It's VERY lightweight, comes in a small carry bag. Since we only used it on the deck, we didn't need to use the stakes for tying it down, but they are included. It's is sturdy enough for what we're using it for and appears to be well made. There was plenty of room inside for us to relax on a pile of pillows in front of the laptop with 2 small dogs and snacks. We carried it indoors without taking it apart, because with a person on each end, you can ""fold"" the tent flat bringing the poles together. If you wanted to use it on the ground, I'd probably recommend a tarp because any sharp sticks or rocks may rip the material, plus you'd feel them. The bottom of the tent is very thin, made of the same material as the rest of the tent. Over all, we love it, it's easy, light weight, easily transported, even carried while assembled, has a removable rain cover so you can enjoy the stars on a clear night. Well worth the price. I'm happy with it. UPDATE: I put the tent on the back deck again for another movie night ""campout"" with my daughter. I left it there overnight to continue the next day. I got up in the morning and it was gone. It was VERY windy, and I didn't have it tied down, so it turns out it blew away. It crossed my yard, flew over my fence, tumbled across the street, around a huge tree, past three more properties and over another chain link fence where I found it in someone's back yard. The rope had caught on the fence and stopped it from going further, so I was able to fish it back over the fence. I carried it back home on my back, wind still blowing hard, filling the still erected tent with air like a kite, and nearly carrying me away with it. I'm a little embarrassed to think neighbors might have saw me, a middle aged woman carrying a fully erected tent on my back, turning me into a human kite on a windy day. I put it back on my deck, this time tying it down, and wouldn't you know it, it didn't even have a single rip in it. Still in PERFECT condition after the ordeal it went through! I love this tent.",,38,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCBG2IWO6TSXU52F6K7NASU263A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YTKN446/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,MOON LENCE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22TO9UXJKAKEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YTKN446,B07YTKN446

The instructions are sewn to the inside of the bag that contains the tent and the rain fly, so losing them should never be a problem. The poles that support everything consist of fiberglass sections that are joined together magnetically making it simple to pack/unpack.

My camping situation: We camped in North Texas in October. It was pretty cold in the evenings (about 40 degrees) and the tent was a bit chilly at times. The main reason for this was that the vented area at the top of the tent does not completely close. I know this is not a design unique to this tent, but in 40 degrees and 20mph winds, I think it makes a big difference. However, having said that, the tent held up incredible well considering the punishing winds it endured. We had all stakes put out and the tent never faltered or ripped or flattened even though I'm pretty sure there were occasional gusts of up to 40mph. Sadly I did not get a chance to see how the tent did in the rain as it was dry our entire trip right up until the morning of the last day. By then we'd already torn the tent down to begin packing. Overall I think the tent did really well and I might have pushed it a bit beyond what it was designed for in temperatures, but I was really impressed. The seams seem strong and the zippers do as well. It's easy to put up and down, even in the challenging wind and it's pretty light for as large as it opens up to.

I grew up camping a lot with my family, but my husband and I just wanted something inexpensive for backyard or weekend camping. We weren't looking for something super light for hiking with or super durable for long term, frequent use in demanding conditions. For $50 this tent easily surpassed our expectations with thoughtful design details and surprisingly good construction. The tent features an internal cargo pocket for your odds and ends and a nice hook at the top for hanging up a battery powered light. There are a couple of panels that unzip and can be rolled up and secured so you have a screened ""window"" for light and airflow. The support rods were easy to put in place with the clip/hook system although I was used to seeing ones that thread through a little fabric channel along the diagonals of the tent. Anyway, the whole thing is a win. If you are looking for a super durable, heavy duty tent and/or need one light enough to hike with, I can't speak to this tent's ability to handle those needs.

Lugging tents around has never been a problem, but I can appreciate it when a good tent comes along. So is this good? The answer is yes. This tent isn't the lightest tent, but its lighter than similar tents at the big box stores or the blue store. The tent manages this by having thinner shock rods. The tent stills sets up solid though, and it did well when I set it up in the back yard when it was pretty gusty with 15mph winds yesterday. Good! The tent is a three seasons tent. The top half is mosquito netting, but we don't have bugs this time of year so I can't really test that out. The door is the normal door-and-screen job. The tent does have two windows in the back, but it does not have a second door. If you want two doors for your two person tents, you want another tent. The people in the tent sleep N/S and the door and window are E/W, so someone has to climb over someone else for late night bathroom breaks. On the other hand, this tent is super comfy sleeping one person, and it's light enough to carry like that. I generally like tents which have two doors but it's personal preference. The guy lines are also reflective on mine, which is great, because I got it to go scout camping. People won't trip over them in the night. The rainfly is also good, it's made of a different material than the tent and it's very waterproof from me leaving it up overnight. Lots and lots of venting which is good even with the windows shut. Water in the tent makes it heavy and makes gear not be warm, so getting the condensation out of the tent is super important.

I'm 5'2 and my husband is 5'11 and we both fit perfectly in this tent. Enough space for us in our two person sleeping bag. The tent was VERY easy to assemble, with the instructions in the bag that it came with. Setting it up for the first time took around 15 minutes but now that we know how it works, I assume that when we put it to actual use, it'll only take less than 10 minutes to set it up. Disassembling it was even easier, taking less than 5 minutes for only one person. It's not an ultralight tent for backpacking/backcountry but it is lightweight enough to carry through a campground. I can't attest to how waterproof it is because I don't intend to use this outside of a lean-to. Can't wait to use it in 2 weeks! EDIT: Used it during our camping trip. Worked perfectly for our needs.

Took it out of the package & had it assembled within 5 minutes. Super easy & nice quality. I ordered a 6x9 grey shag rug to make it a comfy area for them to lay & play and it fit perfectly. They absolutely LOVE their new “fort” & have been relaxing in there all day. Very happy with my purchase. It’s exactly what I had hoped for! I can’t speak to how well it will hold up outside, because we obviously are not using it for that at this time, but it seems well made & sturdy. Oh & did I mention that it’s SUPER lightweight & comes in a very compact carrying bag?! Perfect for camping trips where you have 50 million other things to carry. Don’t hesitate, just buy it!

The space was perfect for our family of four, two adults and two kids. We had to install the rain cover because it was showing to rain and the tent protected us from water. It was pretty windy out, but the tent was solid. I liked that it had ventilation from two sides so the air could flow across the inside of the tent keeping the air inside fresh.

A strong rod is attached to the roof tarpaulin in 2 eyelets and fixed in the middle with a ribbon. All in all, tent is sewn clean, nothing sticks out and the seams are sealed with a transparent tape on the inside. So it can't get wet from rain inside.

I just bring in my laptop. I can't vouch for the water resistance, since it wasn't raining when we used it (so far just once) but here's my experience: I unpacked it. The directions were pretty easy. I'm sure I'll put it together in half the time in the future since I now know how to do it, but it literally only took me about 10 minutes, and that was with stopping a lot to read the instructions. I think the rain cover was actually more difficult for me to figure out and took longer to install than the actual tent, but now I know how to do it. This tent can be put up with rain cover in 5 minutes once you know what you're doing. It's VERY lightweight, comes in a small carry bag. Since we only used it on the deck, we didn't need to use the stakes for tying it down, but they are included. It's is sturdy enough for what we're using it for and appears to be well made. There was plenty of room inside for us to relax on a pile of pillows in front of the laptop with 2 small dogs and snacks. We carried it indoors without taking it apart, because with a person on each end, you can ""fold"" the tent flat bringing the poles together. If you wanted to use it on the ground, I'd probably recommend a tarp because any sharp sticks or rocks may rip the material, plus you'd feel them. The bottom of the tent is very thin, made of the same material as the rest of the tent. Over all, we love it, it's easy, light weight, easily transported, even carried while assembled, has a removable rain cover so you can enjoy the stars on a clear night. Well worth the price. I'm happy with it. UPDATE: I put the tent on the back deck again for another movie night ""campout"" with my daughter. I left it there overnight to continue the next day. I got up in the morning and it was gone. It was VERY windy, and I didn't have it tied down, so it turns out it blew away. It crossed my yard, flew over my fence, tumbled across the street, around a huge tree, past three more properties and over another chain link fence where I found it in someone's back yard. The rope had caught on the fence and stopped it from going further, so I was able to fish it back over the fence. I carried it back home on my back, wind still blowing hard, filling the still erected tent with air like a kite, and nearly carrying me away with it. I'm a little embarrassed to think neighbors might have saw me, a middle aged woman carrying a fully erected tent on my back, turning me into a human kite on a windy day. I put it back on my deck, this time tying it down, and wouldn't you know it, it didn't even have a single rip in it. Still in PERFECT condition after the ordeal it went through! I love this tent.",,38,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCBG2IWO6TSXU52F6K7NASU263A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07YTP4KG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,MOON LENCE,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22TO9UXJKAKEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07YTP4KG5,B07YTP4KG5

I used to have a waver similar to this one, in which I lost in a house fire years ago. I decided to get another one and stumbled upon this one. This one was chosen because the price was good, I like the pink barrels, and that it has 3 barrels. For the length of my hair anything more than 3 barrels would just be too much. So this heated quickly, it was easy to use. I like how it’s upside down compared to my other one but it’s actually better because this doesn’t leave an odd crimp where the barrel starts on the hair. It looks completely natural throughout. The process was easy and quick. This is something I can do to my hair before work. I could wake up with messy hair and use this and still end up looking alright. It took a matter of minutes to do my whole head which is perfect, as I don’t spend a ton of time on such.

However I'm returning it. I need deeper waves. The bedhead waver I have is what I usually use but you have to close it each time when waving your hair.

That's my only complaint. The wave pattern is too shallow for my liking. The waves that you do get from this amazing product are effortless but I need tighter deeper waves.

So a little bit of info about the pillow itself: -it is washable, but you wash the entire pillow (it does not have a removeable cover) -this is a full pillow/lounger without the cutout in the center like most of your nursing (boppy) pillows have -it's very soft and super plush -has a little handle for ease of taking on the go (super portable in general) -cradles your little one without putting them in an uncomfortable looking position Here's a couple of things from my perspective: -ok, so the fact that it doesnt have a removable cover is not a deal breaker, I can at least still wash it as a whole, so I'm not gonna take it to that level and gripe about that -the wording says that this works well for 3+ months, but I feel like it would be better for newborn on up to when your little decides he/she likes to be more in a sitting position than a lounging - I say this because my nephew just turned 4 months and he is wanting to sit up (he has a bumbo and sits up so well in it) so even though he does well on this when he is napping and when he feels like lounging, on most occasions he is now wanting to sit up and he cant do that so well on this and gets frustrated -the portability of this is fabulous - the fact that I can lay him in it on the table while we're eating, lay him in it on the couch while I'm folding clothes, set it on the bed and lay him on it to nap, or even have it on my lap on the recliner while he's napping, it makes this a definite must have on the list of things to have for baby that you didn't know you were missing until you forget it one day and realize just how much you miss not having it -I saw someone mention about this having a safety belt - I can understand that in the event like I said baby is wanting to sit up, but you should always be supervising your little anyhow, so for me I don't think it's necessary. Even if it did have a safety strap and baby decided to roll or sit up, the pillow is so light the whole thing would flip over with them, so what good would it really do? -I do agree that for some things it would be better to have the pillow with the cutout I personally have no issues with this lounger. I love having it, but again as with anything, it's all about personal preference. At any rate, I hope this review helps whether considering this for yourself or as a gift for someone with a little on the way!",,5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG3AOFIHO3UGRYIVDWWB4VQQXZRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08JN2T63Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Nuby,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SPOFNERHVCQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08JN2T63Y,B08JN2T63Y

B08JN2T63Y,"Nuby Baby Nest by Dr. Talbot's, Infant Lounger, Dots Print",4.8,20,FieryXeph,TOP 500 REVIEWER | VINE VOICE,,,,,5,"July 07, 2021",United States,"Comfortable, works well, easy to wash","The first thing I will say is read the warning label on this pillow as there are a lot of things you cannot do with this pillow and most of it I can see for safety reasons. That being said, just be aware of those before using this pillow. My nephew does love sitting on this. It is definitely a good pillow to have for a baby before they are able to sit up on their own. This does a good job in keeping a baby up while also being protective. First thing I will note is put this on the ground that is not elevated in case your baby tends to roll a bit. This is really meant more for new born so that is unlikely that will happen. The pillow is pretty comfortable but not something you can sleep on (according to warning). The cover is something you can remove which is nice for cleaning. It seems to be okay with machine wash and dryer friendly. The design and color is not effected by the wash. The pill is pretty fluffy and comfortable. The ends should keep the baby from rolling off of the pillow at least my nephew has not rolled off yet. I found this is useful for newborns up to a certain age. Once they are able to sit up on their own this pillow is not as useful. The bottom does not have any kind of grip so it can slip and slide around if on a wooden or smooth surface. The sloth design is very cute. The color is a light blue and may not actually be gender neutral to some. Overall this is a good pillow to have for newborn. Please again be aware of the warning tag and see what you can and cannot do with this. The design is really cool and the removable cover is great for cleaning especially if your baby has an accident.",,2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF6RFVIK2MSSR3PQTKQKAVK4HNRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08JN2T63Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Nuby,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TIN7VLY3N4I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08JN2T63Y,B08JN2T63Y

This is a great option for being able to show your baby a little more of their surroundings as they lounge, but this is like all other loungers in that it is not intended for unsupervised sleeping, so this is only going to be good for specifically showing your baby around their environment, as they wish to get up and see more.

Good to have!!,"This are always good to have when you have a itty bitty baby!!! I have 5 grandkids and one on the way (any time now) and have used ours for multiple grands! I finally got a new one (this one) cause our other was worn down from all those years of use! I bought this a few months ago cause my daughter wanted this exact print and it only had a few left!! We got it together about a Month ago and it’s well made!! Soft, good size, good fabrics!!! And super cute print as shown in the pic! These are great for keeping baby “put” when on the bed or sofa!! We don’t worry about baby rolling off cause there is a barrier new baby will have to roll over! This is much safer and we never lay baby on something without them in it!! These are also good for Co-sleeping!! Which my daughters do with all their kids! This gives baby her own space and helps prevent getting squished. It has worked well for us all these years and we do recommend mommies or daddies having this!!! The quality is very nice and Last a long time!!! Easy to remove cover to wash and goes back on easily... it takes time but it goes on once you get b the rhythm of it!! Any how these are a wonderful thing to have....

It is a budget version of the name brand one which costs way more. It also works just the same. Our son slept just as well in this as he did when we held him. BUT! Be warned that the quality of the Ribbon they use to tighten the bed is trash. It began to fray and eventually fell apart. I made the mistake of pulling it out to put a new one in and that was a pain in the butt. We used a soft plastic coated wire hanger that we straightened out and looped ribbon onto. Then used that to thread the pillow. If you want to be proactive. But a nice length of string, tie it to the end of the ribbon and pull the ribbon out to thread the string in.

I have curly c3 hair that is fine and tends to frizz easily. This worked perfectly for me. I was able to wear my hair curly and then use this to add some texture and calm the frizzes on the top layer. I also used it with my hair lightly straightened (one quick pass) to seal the frizzes and then sprayed a sugar salt texture spray on it and it made for perfect beach waves. I only have two suggestions. Switch up where you start your wave at on the hair because otherwise you end up with one wave all over and it doesn’t look near as natural or as effortless. Which is what I usually go for. Use a heat protection of some kind on your hair. With the two heat settings it’s harder to find one that works perfectly for your hair. So you either leave it on longer or use higher heat. Any heat can be damaging so make sure to take care of your locks. The tool itself heats up quickly. It has two heat settings. I had to use the highest but I left it on my hair less time. 4 seconds is usually what it took. The clamp lever is on the opposite side from what I’m use to so if you have that problem there is a slight learning curve but once you get use to that it’s easy. Not a hard change to make for me. It doesn’t come with a book of instructions or troubleshooting or anything just a paper with a short list of instructions. It didn’t bother me much but it’s worth knowing.

It heat up quickly.The best thing about this curling iron is even though it looks bulky but not heavy even for me who have small hands. I have no issues using it. I can maneuver it with one hand no problem. My secret is to hold each section up and out to the side so when it hangs down, it will look natural and add volume.

I looked up videos on using a triple barrel wave maker/triple barrel iron. The one I found most helpful included the suggestion to vary the direction you hold the barrels to your hair, so that the waves get a more natural look. I do recommend using a heat protectant spray or product when using any hot tools, and I certainly did with this device. Without hairspray my hair does not hold much shape, but that's true for me with any device. I prefer using the low setting on this iron, but it would be nice if there were more selection of heat levels. Overall, though, I really liked this tool. It gives a pretty, beachy-wave look. It doesn't take very long to use, and isn't too heavy. It is very large, though, and some caution needs to be used around the face, which is (of course) true of all hot tools, regardless of size.

I have very straight hair naturally and my hair does not hold curl more than a few hours. A few years ago, I bought the Bedhead wave maker and have loved this style ever since. I also get a lot of compliments whenever I use it. The Bedhead wave maker, however, makes very tight waves and I wanted a wave maker that makes looser waves, so I began searching for a tool that will make a loser wave. After a lot of research, I settled on this one. I will definitely use it over my Bedhead wave maker for these reasons: Pros: 1. The waves are loser, which is exactly the style I wanted. 2. I love the kick stand so the hot iron doesn't rest on the counter. 3. You can choose between two temperatures The Bedhead wave maker has none of these features. In addition, the Bedhead wave maker naturally stays open. It has a lock bottom to keep it closed, however after a few years of owning it, that bottom has broken and the only way to keep it locked is to wrap the cord around it. Overall, I highly recommend this wave maker for loose beach waves.",,3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFD7OOZVOBTIA7K5AOKFWJCE3Y5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B08XQ3MWKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,MODVICA,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR0IO9M7SR1TP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08XQ3MWKY,B08XQ3MWKY

I use the higher heat setting as my hair can handle it, but it does have two heat settings for more fragile hair. I have super thick long hair, which makes regular curling wands take forever to do, and it's a nightmare, but this want glides through hair very easy, and you can do larger chunks of hair without having to sacrifice less curl for more hair.

However, it is pretty easy to figure out and just requires some patience, which is well worth it. I love how easy this is to adjust, simply by varying how tightly the ribbon at the bottom is tied. The sewing and the material are of very nice quality. This is a lovely baby lounger, so soft, cozy, and secure-feeling.

However, the edges of the bed sort of block the heat from getting him, and when I saw this I knew it would be perfect since a side of it is open. It comes with a small removable pillow, and it is a really soft co-sleeper that seems to be well made. It is adjustable on one end as there are straps. When my son was a baby we co-slept because he had so many health issues and I needed to be next to him. I would have used something like this in the beginning, but not when he became too big and was able to move around too much. I love the tree pattern. So, if you use this for your child your animals might love it too just like mine.

I like the feature that can warm toast, so if you have to step away from the toaster your toast will not be cold when it gets back. We have done toast, english muffins, and pop tarts and all have come out fine. When you have one toast only, one side of your toast will get much darker than the other side. It did warn about this in the instructions. If you do two you are good. I have not used the other features of this toaster enough to comment on those. If you do have little kids like I do beware fingerprints show up really easily on stainless steel. however, I like the look of it.

I like that it has wider slots that allow you to toast a thicker bagel or a simple piece of toast. One of the options that caught my eye while looking at several different options was the keep warm feature. This is a great feature that allows you to keep you toast warm without further toasting it. When it has finished toasting I provides a beep letting you know that it is complete which is great when you are trying to multi task.

First, I really appreciate that it doesn’t pop toast completely up when done, so you get your toast hot, also the keep warm function is available if needed! The toast lift feature is great when you’re ready to remove toast so you don’t risk burnt fingers having to mess around with toaster tongs. Turns out that this is my favorite feature/s. The thinner design is part of what attracted me to this toaster. It takes up less counter space than typical 4 slot toasters. Also, we like to toast artisan & rye breads which often have longer bread slices and fit easily in this toaster's slots. The beep when toast is ready is nice, though I could do without the beep when starting toaster. I’m not sure what purpose that serves. Defrost function is great for frozen waffles, bagels or bread & nice to have keep warm option. Easy to use, if using just one slot, it doesn’t matter which slot is used, unlike some toasters. Do be aware that even when not using bagel option, which toasts just one side, that one side of toast is darker than other. Never had thought about it before, but I actually find it preferable to have one side of toast crisp & the other side a little less crispy. Since relatively new, I can’t speak to longevity yet.",,38,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF4XNY2625CLJPT46MQRMBGMJUZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B092DSMDSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Hamilton Beach,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BTXC5219XHAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B092DSMDSC,B092DSMDSC

It has all the latest features, plus you can BURN the hell out of yourself by touching the metal top after toasting (nice feature!). But, big surprise, every feature works as advertised! Can't say it's quick ... takes 3 minutes to toast one piece of nice whole wheat with a setting of 5. And it BEEPS ... a lot! It beeps once when it starts, and three times when it stops! And if you have KEEP WARM selected, it beeps every minute during warming and then beeps three times and pops up the toast after only 3 minutes of warming. Evidence that the designers were smoking some strong stuff is the fact that the CORD comes out IN FRONT! And the crumb tray is in the BACK! After all my tests I decided to keep this beast because it does a good job toasting, all the features work properly, and toast does NOT drop past the tray (an almost daily occurrence on my previous toasters when using thin, German flatbread ... maddening). I fixed the cord problem by using fine wire to attach the cord just below the crumb tray (it comes out the back at the point of the tray's finger cutout), so it works like a charm now. See photos for how I did it. I do wonder why it's so difficult to design a proper toaster though. Cord out the BACK ... NO BURN surfaces ... crumb tray in FRONT ... NO BEEPING ... no chance of toast FALLING BELOW the bread tray (the Ham Beach does very well in that department) ... buttons that WORK like they should (ditto) ... and FAST toasting ... is that too much to ask? Evidently it is. SIX MONTHS LATER: Surprised to say that this toaster has provided yeoman service and perfect toast since day one. The beeping isn't that loud (my microwave IS) and does provide notice that the toaster is ON and OFF, which is nice. My cord fix hasn't budged and works beautifully. If I could give an accurate score to this toaster now, it would be a 4.7 ... since I can't, I'm changing my score to a FIVE!

It toasts evenly, it will hold long toast such as sourdough bread, it will toast bagels correctly by only toasting one side as God intended, it will even allow you to set for one slice. It is also easy to clean, but come on how often do we really clean our toasters? So, for the price, this does what it is supposed to do. No frills, no fluff, just a toaster that operates as it is intended. You can't go wrong with this one.

The Bed Head does create deeper curls though so if you like your waves curlier that one is the better choice. The Alure curling iron creates soft waves. DO use heat protection on your hair.

Less bulky. My BH waver is harder to maneuver when I'm doing the back of my head and I end up burning my neck. 2. This waver gives smaller softer waves.

I am visually impaired and have a hard time reading the rolling dials most curlers and flat irons use, including BH. This one has a well lit digital screen so I never struggle to read what setting I'm on. My hair is over processed and can fry in an instant on a setting that it too hot.

I have partially wavy hair on the underneath part of my hair but the rest is straight bc of hormone changes (my hair stylist said this is normal with multiple children) so I wanted to find an item that could compliment my other wavy hairs. This did a phenomenal job! It reaches a temperature of 210 degrees. Stayed pretty hot throughout the entire curling process. I have a LOT of hair (see my pic) and I never once had to stop and let it heat back up. I did notice if I held it a little too long, about 30-40 seconds it would make my hair smell somewhat that nasty burning smell. I want to clarify It didn't ruin my hair but just gave it that smell. So I stuck with about 20 seconds for each section and that worked great! You do have the option to turn the heat down which I'm gonna try next time just to see. Overall, 10/10 for price, product being sturdy, temp control, and curls/waves that it makes.

Initially it seemed tedious but I was learning. I also like to flip it the opposite way as I prefer my hair coming in towards my face. This has allowed this pink ribbon girl who desperately needs a haircut feel petty again. When I missed a few pieces, I just grabbed those pieces, opened three barrel and wrapped those pieces around only one of the 3 barrels. If you do this (wrapping around one barrel while holding it in the open position), be careful as I did burn myself, but learned quickly! THIS is THE perfect iron to bring on that trip for beach blown hair into the night! It's especially great for someone who just doesn't have the crazy time you need to make your hair look nice.

LOVE. Worth the price.,▪️Use bigger chunks of hair. ▪️Change the direction of wand. Some strand vertical. Some horizontal to give a more natural look to the wave. ▪️To avoid a kink start 3-4 inches from root and tilt the edge of the iron away from underneath the section of hair. Not up into the hair. ▪️Use high heat to set all day. ▪️Use heat protectant spray before or 1-2 drops of hair oil (or light cream) after to retain moisture and control frizz or fly sways. I’d been following INH but didn’t want to commit $70 to an iron. Bought this one and glad I did. At first it took forever cause I was doing smaller sections (and I need high high heat). Then I was in a rush and did 5-6 big chunks of hair and this was the result! Highly recommend.

I’ve searched a long time and so thankful I got this one!! It’s very easy to use, gets hot quickly, and the curls really hold!! I can section my hair 3 times (bottom, middle, and top) and that does the trick. I have fine textured hair and it hits my chest in length. Typically, when curling my hair the curls end up completely gone by the end of the day. Not the case with this wave iron, the waves will still be there even the NEXT DAY which is awesome!!

It works great, is easy to use, the temp control is clear, and it’s just $30! Honestly, the first time I used it, I got soooo many compliments. I don’t have to use extra hair product or anything (just heat protectant) and it lasts for days. It is the perfect thing to add it a few waves (if you air dried and have some natural texture) or use on your entire head. I do straighten my ends before using it to give a more modern/messy look. The only thing I don’t love is that the temp is in Celsius, so you may have to convert to Fahrenheit (no biggie) and the cord is shorter than I prefer. But it still gets 5 ⭐️ because the price is so good and none of them are going to be perfect.",,1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG3GVBY6LRUTNK7HKMLNO2V3ZUNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09GV8G287/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Alure,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KLSIQD06UZVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09GV8G287,B09GV8G287

Was excited to try it bc she has VERY long thick hair that can never keep a curl/wave. She has tried hot rollers, single wavers, single curling irons, etc without luck in keeping a curl in for longer than an hr or two. This curling iron produced more like beach-type waves, but since that’s whats “in” right now. She was happy with the results! We knew we would need to curl her straight, long thick hair in small increments to even have a chance. This pic is how the waves look after doing her whole head. (Took abt 30 mins) This was about noon. When she went to bed, her hair looked the same. When she woke up and brushed it the next morning, a slight wave was still noticeable but looked more like she just had naturally wavy hair, if that makes any sense. Overall a good buy and she will use it again when she wants the beach wave look.",,84,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH3XO5TF3HYLM2J37PN3G5SDBRVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B09GV8G287/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=1&filterByStar=five_star&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews,Alure,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RC92E5GMIV7EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09GV8G287,B09GV8G287
