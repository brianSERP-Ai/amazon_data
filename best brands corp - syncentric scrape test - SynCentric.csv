Cuisinart's Metal Classic Toaster has a smooth brushed stainless housing with polished chrome and black accents. Its custom controls let you defrost and toast bagels and bread -- just the way you want them Press any of the four buttons, bagels, reheat, defrost and cancel, to fit your toasting needs. The browning control sets the desired toast color from light to dark, with six browning levels. Product Features Smooth brushed stainless housing with polished chrome and black accents Custom control: 6-setting browning dials, dual reheat, defrost and bagel buttons with LED indicators 1-1/2-inch wide toasting slots Extra-lift carriage lever Slide-out crumb tray Convenient cord wrap Instruction book Limited 3-year warranty Toasting Tips Toasting is a combination of cooking and drying of the bread. Therefore, differences in moisture level from one bread to another can result in varying toasting times. For slightly dry bread, use a lower setting than you normally would. For very fresh bread or whole wheat bread, use a higher setting than normal. Breads with very uneven surfaces (such as English muffins) will require a higher toast setting. Thickly cut pieces of bread (including bagels) will take longer to toast, sometimes significantly longer, since more moisture must be evaporated from the bread before toasting can occur. Very thick pieces may require two cycles. Cleaning and Maintenance Always allow the toaster to cool completely before cleaning. Do not use abrasive cleansers. Simply wipe the exterior with a clean damp cloth and dry thoroughly. Apply any cleansing agent to a cloth, not to the toaster, before cleaning. To remove crumbs, slide out the crumb tray and discard crumbs. Wipe clean and replace. Never operate the toaster without the crumb tray in place. To remove any pieces of bread remaining in the toaster, turn the toaster upside down and gently shake. Never insert any hard or sharp instruments into the slot, as this could damage the toaster and cause a safety hazard. Never wrap the cord around the outside of the toaster. Use the cord storage cleats on the underside of the toaster. Product Dimensions The Cuisinart 2-Slice Metal Classic Toaster measures approximately 10.75"" x 7.13"" x 7.13"". The 4-Slice Metal Classic Toaster measures approximately 11.15"" x 10.65"" x 7.5"". Warranty The Cuisinart Metal Classic Toaster has a limited 3-year warranty. Do not touch hot surfaces.

and what does it do? It toasts bread. In that, it serves its purpose almost every morning. It accommodates wider and longer slices of bread, which was my main concern when looking for a new toaster. It also toasts evenly. So I like it. I would recommend this toaster. Only complaints: The stainless steel is kind of hard to keep looking clean, but that's the downside to the stainless steel look. And there's this kind of nasty scratchy noise every time you lower the bread in the slots. It just sounds kind of cheap. I don't like that sound or feel. It sounds like cheap wire frame. But that's kind of what it is. So...it works great! If you're looking for a toaster, this might be the one for you!","Fantastic Toaster, works and looks great!","I have no idea what some of the reviewers are complaining about. I guess there are some people you can never make happy, like the twits on Twitter. Anyway, this is a great toaster. I highly recommend it. After first buying two other toasters, in the same price range (but different brands), then having to return them because they were junk, I found this little gem. It toasts evenly, is easy to use, looks great, and is the quality you expect in a $60 toaster. Save your time, money, and trouble and buy this one. Ignore the negative ridiculous comments from the cyber morons.",I Would Purchase This Cuisinart Toaster Over All of the Other Ones I have purchased in the Last 20 Years,"This is the most sturdy, well manufactured toaster I have ever had. It actually has a metal exterior. It has a retro active styling and I can toast something froze and it fits a bagel for toasting. Matter of fact, since I have lived in this house have gone through 3 toasters and I didn't use it all that often. So this does cost a great deal more than the chap's I had been purchasing. However, became so disgusted with another toaster not working with smoke coming out of one that I decided to spend the $50 for this Cuisinart brand, deciding that what I had already paid for cheapies, the $50 is a meager amount to pay for such outstanding construction and ease of use.",Black Stainless steel is beautiful,"and it matches my fridge. This toaster is nice and browns evenly on both sides. I like mine dark and it does it perfectly. The variety of options, (bagel, toast, etc) is wonderful. It's easy to use. It pops up well but is a little hot when pulling the bread out (so that is for any toast). I usually don't think it's necessary to spend a lot on a toaster--but it matched my kitchen re-decor. I gotta say though, I do see a difference in the toast...I love having it browned right the first time! (PS, this toaster was on the top 10 list of every toaster review article I read. I agree)",Great product.,"This morning we used the Cuisinart CPT-180P1 toaster for the first time. It's a 4-slice toaster and each side is independent of the other. We actually could have toasted the frozen waffles and the muffins at the same time on different settings... the defrost feature works to defrost frozen waffles, then toast them! The bagle feature we used for the muffins on the 4.5 heat setting and they were perfectly done. Nicely browned on one side, but the back of the muffins were warm and soft. We are looking forward to toasting a whole variety of breads in our new Cuisinart toaster."

This instant tent has preattached poles that make setting up camp as simple as unfolding, extending, and securing. Assemble the tent in about a minute and get started on your adventure. This camping tent is designed with the WeatherTec system that features patented welded floors and inverted seams to help ensure you stay dry if it starts to rain. An integrated vented rainfly offers added protection from the rain and improves airflow without the need for extra assembly. This 4-person tent is made from rugged Polyguard 2x double-thick fabric that stands up to the rigors of the outdoors, so you can use it reliably season after season. The tent offers enough room for 1 queen-size airbed and comes with integrated storage pockets to help you keep small items organized. When it?s time to pack up, the camping tent stores away in the included expandable carry bag that lets you tear away the rip strip for easy packing. Amazon.com Nothing kills a campsite buzz like a tent with too many poles and too little instruction. Enter the Coleman Instant Tent 4, a four-person tent that sets up in less than a minute. The tent is made using an innovative one-piece design, with poles that come pre-attached to the tent. That means there's no frustrating assembly and no parts to lose. Simply unfold the tent, spread out the fabric, extend the poles, and click and lock. The only thing easier is rolling out your bag and sleeping in the open.Made of heavy-duty 150D polyester taffeta, the Instant Tent 4 is every bit as sturdy as its traditional counterparts. The tent is outfitted with Coleman's exclusive WeatherTec system, a series of technical features intended to protect you from inclement weather and nasty storms. WeatherTec tents are built with a coated polyester fabric combined with anti-wicking thread, webbing, and zippers, all designed to keep you dry when the rain comes down. The tent's welded waterproof floor and inverted floor seams, meanwhile, dramatically increase the water resistance by hiding the needle holes inside the tent and away from the elements.The tent is also fully taped, eliminating the need for a separate rainfly. Add in a strong, wind-responsive frame and you have a shelter that performs like a brick house during a storm. In fact, Coleman is so confident in its WeatherTec system that it exposes its WeatherTec tents to a rain room that simulates nasty downpours, and to a wind machine capable of blowing hurricane force gusts. The results? Even after the tests, Coleman guarantees its WeatherTec tents will keep you dry. The 4-Person Instant Tent, which sleeps up to four people in its 8-by-7-foot footprint, stands 59 inches tall in the center and includes room for one queen airbed. The tent weighs 35.55 pounds and carries a limited one-year manufacturer's warranty. Coleman Instant Tent Buying GuideInstant Tents can be set up or taken down in less than one minuteAbout Coleman More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a ""no light, no pay"" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded",,,"0066510974477,0846321582821,0730337080177,9546455464543,9845641646450,0076501073539,0618145509137,8607201767491",,,66510974477,,,Weatherproof: Welded corners

Mil-spec hard anodized 6061 T-6 aluminum, stainless steel Internals, and Injection-molded reinforced polymer ensure years of dependable performance and reliability, All while Shaving weight. At just over 11 oz. , The Mogul bipod is lighter than many pricier bipods currently on the market. Deploying and adjusting the Mogul bipod is quick and easy. Spring-tensioned legs stow neatly forward and snap down and lock into place with one hand. Leg extensions slide and lock securely with the push of a button on any of the seven half-inch spaced locking detents. The legs extend a full four inches, from 6. 3"" To 10. 3"". An industry-exclusive 50 degree of total tilt and 40 degree of total pan are controlled by a glove-friendly knurled tool-less Bipod locking knob located between the extended legs, allowing easy adjustment between shots. Additionally, the Mogul bipod has the exclusive ability to lock pan at 0 Degree while maintaining full Tilt functionality.",,,840815119319,,,840815119319,,,"Made of lightweight Mil-Spec hard anodized

Turn up the setting to a mid-height adjustment for more defined waves. Or, go deep. Adjust to the highest barrel for an ultra-waved-outlook. The adjustment dial is designed to allow you to adjust while the tool is still hot to create unique texture throughout the styling process - so you can switch it up as needed. High heat up to 400°F locks in the style for fast results, while Tourmaline Ceramic Technology helps to reduce frizz and add massive shine. Multiple Heat Settings style all hair types and Instant Heat Recovery helps to ensure your results are fab throughout. This waver is sure to be your new bff and the Dual Voltage feature allows you to pack it anywhere you go for worldwide use. It also includes auto shut-off for safety and a tangle-free swivel cord. How to Get the Look: Starting at the roots, lightly clamp a small section of hair between the barrels and hold for a few seconds. For continuous waves, match the outermost wave and work it down your hair. Feel like switching up your wave?
