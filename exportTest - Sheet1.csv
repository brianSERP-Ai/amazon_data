It accommodates wider and longer slices of bread, which was my main concern when looking for a new toaster. It also toasts evenly. So I like it. I would recommend this toaster. Only complaints: The stainless steel is kind of hard to keep looking clean, but that's the downside to the stainless steel look. And there's this kind of nasty scratchy noise every time you lower the bread in the slots. It just sounds kind of cheap. I don't like that sound or feel. It sounds like cheap wire frame. But that's kind of what it is. So...it works great! If you're looking for a toaster, this might be the one for you!"
B0000A1ZN1,"I have no idea what some of the reviewers are complaining about. I guess there are some people you can never make happy, like the twits on Twitter. Anyway, this is a great toaster. I highly recommend it. After first buying two other toasters, in the same price range (but different brands), then having to return them because they were junk, I found this little gem. It toasts evenly, is easy to use, looks great, and is the quality you expect in a $60 toaster. Save your time, money, and trouble and buy this one. Ignore the negative ridiculous comments from the cyber morons."
B0000A1ZN1,"This is the most sturdy, well manufactured toaster I have ever had. It actually has a metal exterior. It has a retro active styling and I can toast something froze and it fits a bagel for toasting. Matter of fact, since I have lived in this house have gone through 3 toasters and I didn't use it all that often. So this does cost a great deal more than the chap's I had been purchasing. However, became so disgusted with another toaster not working with smoke coming out of one that I decided to spend the $50 for this Cuisinart brand, deciding that what I had already paid for cheapies, the $50 is a meager amount to pay for such outstanding construction and ease of use."
B0000A1ZN1,"and it matches my fridge. This toaster is nice and browns evenly on both sides. I like mine dark and it does it perfectly. The variety of options, (bagel, toast, etc) is wonderful. It's easy to use. It pops up well but is a little hot when pulling the bread out (so that is for any toast). I usually don't think it's necessary to spend a lot on a toaster--but it matched my kitchen re-decor. I gotta say though, I do see a difference in the toast...I love having it browned right the first time! (PS, this toaster was on the top 10 list of every toaster review article I read. I agree)"
B0000A1ZN1,"This morning we used the Cuisinart CPT-180P1 toaster for the first time. It's a 4-slice toaster and each side is independent of the other. We actually could have toasted the frozen waffles and the muffins at the same time on different settings... the defrost feature works to defrost frozen waffles, then toast them! The bagle feature we used for the muffins on the 4.5 heat setting and they were perfectly done. Nicely browned on one side, but the back of the muffins were warm and soft. We are looking forward to toasting a whole variety of breads in our new Cuisinart toaster."
B0000A1ZN1,"So far, so good. I like my toast dark, but I only put the dial up to 4-1/2 I can't imagine what color the bread would come out it I cranked it up to 11. The interior remained fluffy and the outside evenly toasted. I have always had bad experiences with toasters. None ever seem to last more than a year. It's not like the old days. I remember the toaster I grew up with. A wrapper from the Town Talk bag leaned up against it once and melted on, and that bit of bread wrapper was there my entire young life. I think that toaster finally died while I was in High School. Time will tell if this one lasts long enough to keep these 5 stars. I'll let you know!"
