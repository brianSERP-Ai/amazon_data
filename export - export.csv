Also, remote access so that my sweet parents can also watch her when they can’t be around her (hence this quarantine)!The price!!!!! Well worth it and reasonable! The last monitor I had was over $100 and it died just short of its warranty and could not be sent back. Very very VERY pleased with this product.This product also is easy to mount! No weird angle that you need to attach to the wall then screw in the cams!! NOPE attach then click in the cam! Wonderful!","I have the Nooie 1080P indoor camera and I've been quite happy with it so I had to give this 360-degree model a try. It takes the features of the static camera and adds the ability to pan and tilt the camera either manually or you can enable motion tracking easily through the app. I wrote a review for the static camera and many of the features carry over including its great video quality so if you've read that review, some of this will seem familiar.Setup -Setup was very simple using your phone or tablet, running the free Nooie Cam app. You first need to verify that your phone is connected to the 2.4Ghz access point in your home where you will be using the camera. You then simply start the Nooie Cam app and select the +Camera button. You select the Nooie Cam 360 option and it will walk you through the remaining, simple steps. Basically, you assure the camera is on, enter the password for the wireless access point/router your phone is currently connected to (this is the same one you will be connecting the camera to), click Next, and a QR code appears on the screen of your phone. You now hold the screen of your phone in front of the Nooie camera's lens and it provides an audible tone and LED light indicator when it is finished reading the QR code. The app will now inform you that it is pairing and will begin a countdown. When complete, the app will inform you that pairing has completed. It's that simple.Use -Now that the camera has been added, you simply select it to view the camera. To hear audio from the camera, you select the speaker icon within the app and now you are able to see and hear what's going on around the camera. The camera also has a built-in speaker that allows you to press the microphone button within the app and then speak through it. This is very useful and/or just fun depending on where you locate the camera. For example, I have the camera in my living room where my cat typically spends a good part of her day. If you have cats, I'm guessing yours is similar where she doesn't have one place that she always lays within a room. She instead has multiple locations that she'll randomly select. With this 360 degree camera, either from home, from work, a restaurant, wherever I have WiFi or cellular access I can pan the camera from left to right and up or down. It's range is great where you can literally place the camera in the center of the room and, from the app, turn it from it's left side behind it all the way around front, through to the right side behind it just by swiping across the screen with the camera's image live the whole time. You can pan it around to see the entire room. Beyond this, you have the ability to tilt the camera up and down from the app as well by swiping up and down on the camera's image live. I can scan the room for my cat, locate her, and then touch the microphone to talk to her. Being a cat, she chooses whether she wants to respond or not. Sometimes her ears just perk up and she whines (which you can hear through the camera's built-in microphone), but other times she'll choose to walk over to the camera and give it some love. :)If you choose to use the Motion Tracking feature, if your cat, or anything really, moves in front of the camera's lens, the camera will follow it. As the moving option moves close to the edge of the camera's current visibility, the camera will move to center the moving object within it's vew and continue doing this until the moving object either stops moving or moves behind something where the camera can no longer see it. One thing to note with automatic Motion Tracking is the camera can pan 360 degrees. If something moves and the camera ends up pointing in a different direction than the next moving object. The next moving option must move in front of the lens at some point for the camera to see it and start tracking it. Depending on where you mount the camera and your use, this may be fine or it may not. So, definitely think about this before placing the camera if you plan to enable Motion Tracking.Video and audio can be recorded to either a microSD card or to the cloud. Cloud storage is a paid service. Given my usage, microSD recording is fine for me so I haven't tried the cloud storage option. MicroSD recordings are easily accessed through the app via a scrollable tape across the bottom of the screen. You select the day and then scroll through to the time you would like to view. If at any time you are viewing live video or recorded video from the app and you would like to save the video to your device, you simply press the camera icon on screen to set the start point, continue watching the video as it plays, and press the icon again when you'd like to stop and the video will be saved to your device. It's VERY easy!Like other security cameras, you can also setup notifications based on sound and/or motion. This too is easy to configure by selecting None, Low, Medium, or High for each option and then selecting the timeframe that you would like to receive notifications. Note that you can enable disable notifications by day, but each day only has one start time and one end time that can be selected. Meaning, you cannot setup notifications from 8am-5pm and then again 10pm to midnight for the same day. You could do one or the other, but not both. I don't see this as a problem for me, but it's worth noting depending on your use case.There are a few additional notable settings. First is the ability to enable/disable audio recording. I haven't done much testing with this, but I'd imagine this could save some space on your microSD card, allowing you to possibly record more video if disabled. Second is the ability to enable/disable the small LED light on the camera. If you placed the camera in a visible location in your home, you may want to disable the LED to avoid the distraction of it. Last, there is a Rotate Image option. So, if you need to mount the camera under an overhang, cabinet, etc., you can simple tap this button to flip the image for mounting the camera upside down and now viewing it live or recorded video will display right-side up.Customer Service -I reached out to Nooie's customer service prior to purchasing my previous camera as I had a number of questions. I received quick, thorough responses the same day, shortly after I had sent them. I worked with Julia who was great to work with. Very friendly, personable, and understanding. Julia's customer service was great and made the decision to purchase this camera a complete no-brainer. As I'm sure many of you know, when you have questions or something goes wrong you really find out what a company is made of. I'm happy to say Nooie's support is great! Regarding this camera, I had a few questions for Nooie support prior to purchasing it and received the same great, prompt responses. This proved even moreso that their support is great! It wasn't just a one time fluke with the first camera.Summary -This camera works great and has clear video. The two-way communication capability is an added bonus and could open up its use to more than just a security camera. It's ability to automatically track motion as well as it's ability to turn 360 degrees while automatically tracking motion and/or by manually swiping the screen coupled with it's low price point of under $40 makes this a great buy in my book! I am definitely glad that I added this camera to my home. It will work well keeping track of not only the cat, but I can see when my teenager comes and goes when I'm not home.",Especially like night vision quality! Using it as grannycam for dementia mother who can roam house at night.,Awesome camera and quality. I've bought 2 already and one of the non moving ones as well.

It took several tries to pair it with the Wi-Fi but every device I have ever added like this requires several attempts to pair. Customer service was excellent I used the chat to communicate with customer service. They were very patient and helpful. I had a problem with the wording they used to instruct you to create a password. The technician directed me and sent me a sample password to use to login and from there he checked back with me several times to make sure that the set up was complete and I had no more questions. I do not know what time zone they are in but the customer service rep that I was chatting with was up with me until almost midnight. If you buy as many gadgets as I buy that need technical support I can tell you that the customer support is most definitely excellent. I purchased this camera because I bought a beach house in Mexico and it is made out of concrete.

These guys make great cams, and they have great customer support. I needed a cam for my back deck but I also needed a new porch light. This jewel solved both problems.The cam was easy to set up, just make sure you are on the 2.4 wifi. Simple to follow the instructions and you will be up and running in about 5 minutes. I use Ispy connect to monitor my cameras at home but I have the app on my phone when away.The camera is very customizable see photo 4 Using the HiCam app on your phone you can find the ip address of the camera ; go to settings>Device Info and the IP will be displayed. Type that IP into IE and you have access to lots of settings see photos. They have great customer support. I have NO, and I do mean ZERO complaints about any Hosafe cam I own. They have proven to be very reliable, I have had the outdoor cam for about 4 yrs + , the indoor ptz cam for about 3yrs and even though it has taken some abuse because of being in a chicken coop it works great. I highly recommend any Hosafe produce you may be interested in. Did I mention, they have great customer support.","This is one of several Hosafe cameras I have in use at my home and business. Hosafe customer service has always been excellent and quick to respond. That said, this latest and newest camera they are offering is a good value for the price.The many features are very appealing, but their execution needs some development. More on that later. First, when taken out of the well packed box I was surprised that the camera is very light and made of mostly plastic (assume the UV rays of South Florida don’t deteriorate the material as some plastics in the sun) and lighter weight to install. While the large dongle of wires (mostly the RJ 45 LAN connector) that usually are protruding out the bottom of the mounting base, this wire bundle exits out of the side of the base making wire management a bit more tricky if you want to hide them and protect their connection points. With the quicker set up on these newer cameras not requiring a hard wire to the router initially, I think the RJ 45 connector could be eliminated assuming you are only going to use the wifi connection which in reality is why you buy a “wifi” camera! That would eliminate the need to drill a ½ or larger hole to run those wires. As I have with the past 3 installations, I choose to mount my cameras on an outdoor plastic electrical box to terminate the wires and ease of attachment to the building. But this time instead of a large hole in the box cover under the base of the camera, I had to route the wire into the side of the box as shown in the photo. A bit tricky to keep it weather tight with a grommet.Now the features: The LED light source that comes on with motion is pretty bright and a welcome addition to illuminating the subject area and obtaining full color pictures at night. There is also an audible alarm but I am not using that for a good reason… the sensitivity of motion adjustment is adjustable but even at the lowest setting in the app, it is triggered with least bit of wind movement and even insects at night. So, the light is triggered often (that is ok with me) and that alarm would be a nuisance. The same problem comes into play with the other cool feature; motion tracking of the pan and tilt mechanism. Great feature and as stated, not real quick for fast moving objects but with the ultra-sensitive motion detection, it moves much too frequently. Also the range is pretty limited so as the subject moves out of the range (about 10 meters) the camera returns “home” and the subject is now out of the picture. Again, a great feature, but a bit of a delay upon motion ending and much broader sensitivity setting would be big improvement on these new features.Overall, the image is very clear and adequate resolution. Night vision (without the LED light on) is very good as expected. Wifi with the dual antenna is about average for me. I am only getting 60% on an outside, side wall about 15 meters line of site (through the house). My other cameras on the front side which are about half the distance are 100% signal strength with only 1 antenna. Your results may be better as there are many variables controlling wifi strength from inside to outside.The other great feature and the main selling point for me is you not only can use an SD card for image and video capture, but it is also ONVIF compatible to use the many camera security monitoring programs like Blue Iris and others. I am still experimenting with camera control on Blue Iris as it is registering with “generic” camera and all the features do not seem to be accessible so far.Lastly, the two-way audio works well and is another great feature for an inexpensive camera like this. I would buy it again.","This camera is quite impressive for its price. This is my first IP camera I have bought since 2008 and wow. The technology has sure quickly advanced.This camera has HD video and Audio. It does look very nice. The camera set up was so easy! I got confused at first, but then I read the instructional book and it put me back on track. Wifi set up was a breeze. Don’t forget to buy a microSD card for it, so you can record and store video. The auto tracking is impressive, the PTZ function is so fluid.Overall, very impressed. You will be too.Thanks HoSafe!","I've been hunting around for a decent, inexpensive outdoor PTZ camera. Other models I'd tried claimed to have ONVIF compatibility but never did. So far, this camera exceeds the requirements I put in place with only some minor caveats.First off, the design. The shell is made of plastic and is generally very light. While I'd prefer a metal case, the light weight of the case should make it easier to mount. The connections are all on a pigtail coming out the right side of the base. I'd prefer for them to be say receesed in the base or something, but nothing we can't work around! Other than that, the design is what you'd expect from a dome camera.Next, configuration. Power comes from a 12v 1A transformer with a 5.5mm jack. The cord provided is very short but it's a common size and will be easy to replace with something longer. Plugging it up and connecting it to my network brings me to my next point I highly recommend this camera. Unlike others that require some APP to configure the camera, this one just works. It's assigned an IP address and then you can log right into it and begin configuring it as needed. While an APP is available for both Apple and Android, just log into the camera! Through the web config, it only takes a few minutes to enable WIFI and connect it to your network. I want to mention how this camera is truly ONVIF compatible. Some other cameras claim this but aren't. In the case of this camera, it's instantly picked up using ONVIF Device Manager and can be configured this way. Massive thumbs up from me!Image quality is good and about what I expected from the camera. During the day, it's a little over saturated and too sharp. Tweaking tweaking the settings slightly improved the image greatly. Though what really sets this camera apart from similar models is the inclusion of flood lights. I've included a quick comparison of no lights, flood lights and then standard IR lights. Both uses of lights provide good images in the dark. Flood lights give you color at a shorter range with IR being black and white but showing more detail further out.The PTZ control is very good too. My other indoor PTZ cameras have always been very choppy and nearly impossible to make minor changes. This camera on the other hand is much smoother and allows for very minor bumps in adjustment. It also will remember it's last location if power is lost! Something none of my other PTZ cameras seem to do (without additional settings).All in all, I'm happy with this camera. I think my only real complaint is the how short the power cable is. But given the going price for this camera, you can add an extension still keep the price around if not lower than some similar cameras.","We bought two of these to install one by our front door and one over the garage door. I liked the quality so much,I bought a third to use in our back yard. Great for a security camera, but I'm thinking this might captured images of all the birds that visit. Already plugged in and working. For those buying this item, the included manual is a bit small to read easily, but it does explain installation. The app ""Camhipro"" is necessary for install, and I can control all three from one device. I used an old smart phone for the cameras so I left the app off my active phone! That way one has complete control, access to all the images, mic and speaker work fine, but does not interfere with voice or text communication.

Good night vision,"This IMOU camera has very good coverage with pan-tilt control in the smartphone. I cannot hear any noise when doing the pan-tilt movement. One surprise is that this camera has one privacy cover that can be controlled via smartphone. Another advantage is the super low video latency (almost less than 1/4 second). The sound latency is normal around 1s.I always want to have one camera with pan-tilt control that can cover the whole room without using multiple cameras. I purchased one Samsung SMARTCAM A1 (only can pan the camera up to 350° not tilt) before, however, the software is very hard to use and cost me more than $200. I also checked other famous brands like Ring and Arlo, but they just do not have any camera that supports pan-tilt control. Mi has one pan-tilt control camera, but I have some problems with the night vision of other Mi cameras. There is a clear ""click"" sound when the night vision is switched on. When the room has some light and not full dark, the camera's night vision will switch on and off frequently and causing lots of ""click"" sound. So far, I did not notice the ""click"" sound problem in this IMOU camera. I did experience one connection error in the initial setup, but I retried again and it works smoothly. I think the initial connection problem is caused by the permission issues in the iPhone. The IMOU camera can automatically connect to the device's wifi without letting you go to the Setting and manually switch wifi. This feature requires the permission in iOS to allow the device to access the local network, after I accepted this permission, the connection is very smooth.","What a value for the money. Delivers on everything it advertises and more. The picture quality for both day and night settings is great. The app is packed with features and easy to use. I will be ordering more.I had settled on this/these camera rather than a full ip camera (NVR) system due to the major price difference. I was willing to sacrifice the ip streaming and local recording in order for ease of setup and to save a few bucks. I was poking around in the settings and come to realize this camera supports RTSP (realtime streaming protocol) which allows setup with most security camera software. I am impressed by this capability in such an affordable camera.My only gripe (and it is a small one) is that the motors that move the camera were virtually silent when I received the cameras, however now that I have had them mounted (inverted/upsidedown) for several days, you can hear every time the camera tracks motion. I am not sure if this is a result of me mounting the cameras upside-down or not, however I assumed this was alright to do since the settings give you the option to invert the output stream. Clearly this was not big enough of a deal for me to take away a star on the rating.","I love this camera. I got it because I have a lot of house deliveries and they come inside the house. Where I have the camera it catches the front door, back door, and my windows. I can see everything on my phone. It even accommodates my two cats.","Set up was a bit dicey but once I figured it out, what a great camera. I can share with my family and even talk to them. Exceeds what I wanted from this device. Excellent choice!",I like it but I'm just no happy that I have to use another app to open it.

Starting with a rugged, dependable build and ending with cutting edge electronics, the Amcrest Amcrest 4MP Outdoor PTZ POE + IP Camera offers a range of features most other cameras don’t. Below are a list of pros and cons, followed by some suggestions for potential improvement.Cons:No speaker for talkback includedNo microphone included for the listen function (there is wiring in place to connect external speaker and microphone, but such accessory is not included and would have to be purchased separately; also a quick search on amcrest.com does not find such accessory, maybe a third party/).Camera switches to nighttime even as light appears to be sufficient and abundantHaving trouble focusing when zooming in, faces are out of focus, blurred and with apparent image ghostingLarge and heavyFisheye and privacy mode not availableAuto-Tracking not available in mobile appWhen on the mobile app, image ratio is either squeezed (portrait mode / vertical) or stretched (landscape mode / horizontal)Cloud app is laggy, with pan tilt relatively responsive but the image is significantly lagging behind with anywhere between 3 to 10 seconds delayExpensiveProsVery solid built, sturdy, all the components included, reliable hardware, screws and bolts, rubber washers - all to ensure a watertight installation (even gloves are included)Minimum lag on Amcrest View app (not the cloud app)Very responsive PTZGreat POE+ power function, No need for additional 24 V power or 110V power plug, just pull an ethernet cable connected to a POE+ switch, plug in the camera, scan the camera bar code with the app, and installation is done!Easy setup top with the existing appLocal storage and SSD card for up to 256GbGood iris control, good iris range - the iris opens very well allowing plenty of light.Potential improvements:Software:Improve software to coordinate zoom focus and Iris in a way that allows for better image clarity and less Image ghostingImprove mobile app (Amcrest Cloud) to display real size image (rather than stretched or squeezed)Hardware:  If possible reduce size and weight. On a large commercial property this may not be an issue, but on smaller residential buildings this camera may stand out.Include speaker/microphone for two way communication","Amcrest PTZ POE outdoor camera is build like a tank. Very well constructed with metal double enclosure (for protection from heat of the sun I suppose) and sturdy and thick aluminum mount. This surveillance camera is a serious business with 32x optical zoom and motorized dome. You can control pan with full turn 360° angle and 90° tilt. Camera can move quickly or slowly and is completely silent all the time. It uses a very good motor for sure. Picture quality is stunning and you can see every smallest detail on your property in Ultra HD resolution. To connect camera you will need just Ethernet cable connected to POE+ switch. You also need to download the App and get the camera to your network. You can watch and control video on a phone, iPad, computer or NAS.It can be connected to NVR as well which I actually did. I connected the camera to my existing surveillance system Hikvision NVR via ONVIF protocol and it started working immediately. Even PTZ control works well from my NVR. Amazing compatibility. It also has paid cloud storage support or you can just record video or events to onboard microSD card. Camera has a nice web UI with lots of settings. You can program camera movement as you wish, there are many features and functions here. Night vision works pretty good and camera focus works well enough.Highly recommend product if you have large property.","I've been waiting on Amcrest to step up their game and offer a new high-end ptz cam. Here it is. 32x optical zoom plus you can turn on 16x digital zoom. The latter is kinda buried in a menu but it IS there. This cam is like having a several thousand dollar Axis camera as one of my Blue Iris cams. Yes, it connected up to B.I. easily with no hassle. Great night and day vision. I have not dealt with the AI yet so I can't comment on that aspect. The zoom/ptz interaction works like a high end cam should. When you're zoomed way into something, the ptz is still easy to manage. You can add a 256gb card into it if you wish. Going to buy a 2nd one of these and retire an existing Amcrest 18x older ptz to some other duty. Oh, another thing: It's quiet. Even when you are next to it (and I was for several hours installing it), it's silent, even when doing a ptz move. This feature may be very useful for some of you. I've seen a lot of noisy ptz cams. This one is not. I have not turned on the defog option yet, so I'm unsure if that introduces any fan noises or not.","This is a very solidly built POE Camera.The installation of this camera was a breeze. I already had the Amcrest View Pro installed (for my other camera from Amcrest). So installing this camera as an additional device was very simple. The fact that it works using POE made my installation very easy as I didn't have a power connection near the garage where I have installed this camera. But, since I already had an ethernet wire running there, I was just able to connect it to the existing ethernet wire and connect the other end to the POE Converter that I had bought earlier.This is a security camera that I have installed outside my garage in a spot that is kind of hidden so that no one can see the camera.The camera supports 256GB of memory. This will allow me to store a lot of recordings without having to delete occasionally.The zoom of this video is great. I was able to pan/zoom to see every minute detail of the person's face who was standing like 20 ft from the camera.The Camera price seems to be high. But, for the quality of this camera it might be worth it. I will know if I can use this to monitor any security intrusion at my house like the one I had earlier, when someone tried to break into my car parked outside the garage. But, we were not able to find out who it was as the face was hardly clear in the night mode with my existing security camera.Any integration with Alexa or similar services would be helpful.It is also nice that the camera can be broadcast live using RTSP so that it can be shared with anyone.The application also allows sharing the camera with other family members. That's a big plus. When I am out of home or do not have internet connectivity, my wife can monitor itOverall, I would give this a 4.7 out of 5 rating.","This camera is hands-down the best built camera I’ve ever personally used or tested. The quality of the materials is second to none. The camera is heavy as you would expect it to be due to the high end components. The starlight sensor in it is incredibly accurate and detailed in low light. The night vision reach that I’m able to get with it is quite incredible. It’s easily almost twice the distance that most other more consumer oriented cameras have. The PTZ motors and components are whisper quiet and fast. There are no weak, shaky or dead spots in the camera travel. I can set it to a position I need with incredible ease. The 32x optical zoom is also pretty fantastic and leaves nothing to be desired. It will go super far. I didn’t find myself feeling the need to turn on the additional 16x digital zoom. I also love that it has two sub streams in addition to the main stream. That is incredibly helpful in more complicated blue iris setups. The AI seems to be working well also. This camera is incredibly smart and fast. It isn’t held back by buggy firmware. It reacts quickly and smoothly. This camera is a great “eye in the sky” type of camera. I can get tag numbers and critical details reliably due to the excellent specifications of this camera. The included mounting hardware and cables are all excellent quality and instructions are concise and clear on how to get it all mounted and hooked up with ease. The multiple options for powering the camera are nice as well. Another welcome addition is the trip wire hookup. That isn’t something you typically see on the smaller, cheaper cameras. My only request would be that the camera have a small speaker and microphone built in for situations in which hooking up an external mic and speaker aren’t feasible. However, amcrest has many other options for these use-cases as well. I’m incredibly happy with amcrest as a company and this camera is nothing short of amazing.",10,7,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-Outdoor-Motorized-Security-IP4M-1083EW-AI/dp/B08TYZ5XFC/ref=sr_1_22_sspa?keywords=360+security+camera&qid=1640229424&sr=8-22-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyUVk4RzNGNDEwS1NOJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzU5NjM1OUMyM05FRTM5SThCJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyODU2MzkyN0dCRjI3WjNINUVBJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYnRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

I was looking for a camera to put in my son’s room so that I don’t have to follow him upstairs all day long but can still keep an eye on him.The night vision works great. So far the pictures have been very clear. I also really like the fact that you can use this camera live, so you don’t necessarily need an SD card, unless you want to record and don’t want to buy the cloud service. I do plan on buying another camera for my living room so I will be inserting a micro SD in that camera.I will admit I had a very difficult time connecting the camera to my router. I have dual band WIFI through XFinity. The first time I tried to connect the camera it didn’t work. So I did some research and managed to separate my Wi-Fi into the two separate bands: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. (I had them together under one name and password.) I attempted to connect the camera to the router several more times after that but it still wouldn’t connect. I ended up spending an hour trying to connect the camera to no avail.Finally I noticed in the little instruction booklet that it says you can connect your camera directly through the modem (a modem cable is included in the box the camera came in.) Lo and behold I was able to connect the camera within just a few minutes. I then went into the app and changed the setting from modem to WIFI. I sincerely wish I had tried this method within the first few minutes of failing to connect through the Wi-Fi because it would’ve saved me a lot of time and effort. (There was no need to separate the two bands. Ugh!)I hope this helps anyone else who may be having a difficult time connecting their camera.Overall, great little piece of equipment!","I was a little intimidated about setting up this camera. But I followed the directions slowly and calmly, one step at a time, and everything worked with ease. What fun. The picture is really clear. It is cool that you can move your fingers on the camera screen, wherever you are, and the camera head will rotate accordingly. So you can scan the whole room (350o rotation). And the fact that it includes audio is awesome. So it could also be used as a baby monitor or to hear if your dogs are barking, etc. Or you could talk to the baby, dogs, other adults in the room. One drawback is that the camera has to be connected to USB/power. That greatly limits where I can use it. The instructions are very good for setup, but then it is lacking in real directions on how to use it in everyday use. Most things you can figure out for yourself. Although I have an Alexa device, I was not able to use it with Alexa because it requires an Alexa screen device as well. But overall, I like this camera.","Well this little beauty is sweet. It came within 24 hours (thanks Amazon Prime) and in a nice little box and set up was a breeze (iPhone user). Once you download the application via the App Store, the instructions walk you through set up step by step. You do need your WiFi login, and it does not support 5G WiFi. The sound it makes is a little weird during pairing with WiFi/router connecting but it’s temporary, so you’ll get over it, your sleeping newborn- maybe not so much. Once your set up is complete, you can change the settings for motion detection notification and also sensitivity. I tried stealth mode of moving really slow and also trying to play flash lightening and it caught me on both and sent a notification to my phone of said sloth intruder or lightening McQueen in the house. It has a two way speaker so really nice to be able to yell at the dogs or scare the bejeezus out of your roommate. I’m shocked at the picture quality. I was going to upload a picture of myself in it, but the quality is good that I needed a filter- maybe on their next update. Also, kind of cool that nightmode has its own settings (and throwing it back to the 40s with no color to set the Friday the 13th ambiance) so just in case you want to catch ghosts on camera, I’m sure you can set it to Orb sensitivity. Overall, really great quality product and totally worth the money.","Alright so first off, the price. At 30fps and 1080 with all the extra features. It seemed to good to be true. With that being said, I was eager to play with this one. It comes nicely packaged and about the size of a soda can. Has a two hole mount that can be screwed on many surfaces, walls, ceilings. The mount is an easy twist on so the camera can be taken down with ease. The Picture quality honestly blew me away for a 1080. There’s a lot of 1080s out there that just plain suck. Tethys is true to their word on this one. The night vision is slightly under what they say it can do (32ft I believe) but it’s still plenty of range for your buck. The camera movement is smooth as well. You just swipe down to go up and left to go right and so on. The set up was a little bit of a pain until I realized the manual said something different than what the app tells you to do. Basically just have the camera and your phone right next to the router and it hooks up in seconds. Took me a few tries to realize this. The interface on the app is Fairly easy and any beginner can figure it out. The cloud service does cost money I’m not sure how much. All in all this thing is hard to beat for the price and features packed into it. In the photos in my living room there is a sign way back by the kitchen. The next photo is the camera zoomed in on it to show the quality.","Unit was defective when received. Was asked to move to different locations to see if it would help. I did that and after many tries, it still refused to work wihout the irriataing beep,beep either immediately, or after several ours or days.They want me to pay the return shipping. I won't buy from them again!UPDATE:Original Purchase date Nov.30 2019. Today Feb. 24 2020.I finally did get a replacement and this one works very well. Tethys did send the replacement at no cost and sent a prepaid return label to return the defective camera. They are nice cameras. I bought 2 the first time and only one worked, but after several email exchanges, Tethys made good on their warranty and paid the shipping both ways. Tethys truly seemed to wanted to do the right thing after our email conversations, so I am changing my rating to five stars, 4.5 would be more accurate as it did take longer than it should have to resolve the issue. I do belive the product is a quality item, and I just received a defective one the first time.

It also features NAS recording built in without having to fool with a custom firmware (which may be fixed now) but record to a NAS is easily setup in the recording menu of the EUFY and works perfectly.I do have 2 gripes with the camera...The main one is that there is no 2 factor authentication for my Eufy account. This is concerning because despite not being able to directly view footage or feed from a website, if you use a weak password, someone can theoretically login to the eufy app on their own smart phone and gain access to your camera. Fair enough so use a strong password right? What happens if a hacker decides they want to contact support posing as me and gives them a different email address and has customer support reset the password? I've experienced this and 2FA saved me. What security protocols does Anker support have to follow to ensure that they don't unknowingly unlock my account to someone else?Germany and Canada just recently got 2FA so hopefully the US is close behind. I will not be buying more of these until they get it and will be sticking with wyze until they implement 2fa. If they don't have it by the end of the year, I will update my indoor cams with something else, which may be a shame because right now, no one offers anything NEAR this good of image quality for the price. Maybe ring and Arlo will have an affordable 2k camera by then if Eufy/Anker don't get 2FA established for US customers.Gripe number 2 is that I wish the tilt could tilt a little lower. I tested the cam on a bookshelf and my mantle and it seems like it should be able to look down further than it does so you'd have to prop it up with something under the camera or something like that to get a better look if it's high on a shelf.Honestly, all cloud devices run a risk of some form of security breach. Nothing is bulletproof. I think that I'd be comfortable sticking these in the garage, a workshop, patio, etc.. somewhere outside but nothing on the inside of my home just yet until I know for sure that Anker support couldn't be socially engineered to give access to my account to someone besides me.","I have two of these cameras along with an Eufy doorbell and they are unmatched in my opinion. The A.I. can be set to only send notifications for people. When set for people it ignores cars, moving branches, lightning and animals. It really works as advertised. I have tried many brands of cameras and video doorbells and none can match the Eufy ability to reognize people and not be mislead by other movement. Try one and you will not regret it.","Best bang for your buck camera on the market. I own the 2k doorbell, vacuum and now indoor pan and tilt camera from eufy. They have exceeded my expectations. For a similar price you can find other cameras on amazon however I believe this camera paired along with the app is well worth it. I own outdoor cameras from another company and although the quality is good the app support is awful. That is why I believe eufy’s security line may be my future outdoor setup. The pan and tilt features are easily controlled with the app, notifications are instantaneous and quality is great and you have the ability to use local storage. Looking forward for this company to keep adding and improving their products.","The camera is compact and well designed, setup is super easy. The 2K images are impressive and the two-way audio is great. The smart AI been very good just sometimes individual false detections(I understand it is difficult to be 100% accurate).I’m Apple HomeKit user, this camera's HomeKit function works fine, and even supports HomeKit Secure Video! I am very satisfied with getting so many features at such a great price.","The image and build quality at this price point is truly hard to believe. This camera has both human and pet detection, either one can be turned on or off. The human detection is accurate, as is the pet detection. The really cool feature is that it snaps a face shot of whichever animal, human or pet, and has it as the icon on that particular event it was detected for a quick and easy determination of who set off the camera alert.There’s no going wrong with this camera. You’ll need a micro sd card if you want to save events, or pay for cloud storage.

I only had one problem in setting it up, and that was realizing that was indeed an user manual stored in the packing, inside the box. Once I found this it was simple to set up and put into operation. I had charged it prior to doing the setup. The user manual stepped me through the instillation of the software and connecting to my wireless network and I was up and running.

With this camera we see way fewer and much more accurate notifications. This is especially nice when we are away from home and can track if someone enters the kennel without our knowledge.

It was too expensive for my budget, so I bought the 4 camera expandable system they have.Before ordering I had some questions about it, so I emailed Mr. Johnny from the company, and he responded within an hour, and answered everything I had concerns with. Tell me, which company answers customer emails within an hour??After testing and playing with that system, and finding out that it is so easy to set up, it is LEGIT plug-and-play. Since I wanted to be able to talk to someone at my front door, so I ordered the dome camera. I just played with this camera, and wow it is beyond good. I can CLEARLY talk to and listen to anyone, from their free app. This dome camera can also be controlled and rotated automatically through the app. And the floodlight is so bright it can light up the whole place.I played around with the cameras in the dark, in the light, with sounds, the microphone, etc. Overall, this system is as good or better than the professional systems that cost thousands that I have had in the past.This system is so good that it actually has AI face and body detection, and also notifies your phone each time it detects something.If you want a really good single camera or want to add on to your existing system, that is easy to use, and really well priced, legit get this system.","We added this to our existing NVR system. We feel even more secure with the 2 way audio. We were planning on purchasing a ring by Amazon before, but with this camera, the ring is no longer needed.Pros:- connects to our existing NVR system- works well on the app- able to view more with the PTZ viewing control.- 2 way audio should deter people from doing questionable activities- we placed it close to our motion sensor light so it will have great visibility even at night.Cons- a little bulky- I had a little trouble getting the video to show on our NVR system. Connection was easy. Video playback just took me some further looking into.Despite the cons, I still give it a 5-star since I was able to find a solution and the bulkiness isn't that big of a deal.","Notable upgrades in this latest release include FULL COLOR night vision using white LED's or more traditional IR night vision. Two way audio, built in siren, though I have not even tried that as I am scared of false alarms being a nuisance. If you are looking for an outdoor security camera you want it to handle as many functions as possible in one unit. By allowing for pan and tilt, I can have this mounted where I can look out in many directions and see many things in the front and side of the property. Equally versatile is you can use this camera with the App (including on your computer) or hook in with your Hiseeu NVR if you go that route. Customer service from these folks is always top notch.",999,313,https://www.amazon.com/Hiseeu-Floodlights-Waterproof-Compatible-WHD303/dp/B08JYMYPCM/ref=sr_1_32?keywords=360+security+camera&qid=1640229433&sr=8-32

Highly recommend this system (the latest version) to anyone looking for a self-installed home system.","Guessing that a lot of these purchases are event driven and mine certainly is. We have a cabin and a barn on a 6 acre piece of property. The barn is where we park the tractor and store the supporting tools and supplies. The barn was recently broken into and everything of value was taken. While that is deeply disheartening, it really only affects me. If the cabin were to be robbed and ransacked like the barn was, I have several young children that would likely never want to go/stay there again.I do consider myself handy when it comes to mechanical and electronic projects. I also believe that I am a good researcher and analyst. I found that there are a lot of great alarm systems available at very affordable prices today including DIY professional systems. Several of the professional systems now have videos on installation and configuration—configuration used to be the tough part of installing one of those.In my case, I was looking for a balance of price, ease installation and options for monitoring. Given the recent break-in, I also wanted to get this project started and completed quickly as the cabin is just as vulnerable as the barn.This next statement may make you question my research, or at least, reading abilities. While I did plan to have the system monitored, I didn’t realize until after I purchased my SimpliSafe system that you can’t monitor the system remotely at all with the app without one of the SimpliSafe plans, and, at the time of this writing, March, 2021, you have to have the $25/mo. plan to do any serious monitoring. I would have putt off having the system monitored for a while if that were not the case. Perhaps it is better that I was forced into a plan earlier than I wanted. As an aside, SimpliSafe gives you 3 days of ‘practice’ use after you activate your system. This means they won’t contact local law enforcement if the system detects and alarm. On the one hand I wanted my system monitoring to start immediately but, do understand the logic of giving me time to learn to use the system without causing false alarms.The installation was truly easy. Once you plug in the basestation and pull the battery tab on the keypad, you are off to a great start. Installing any of the sensors is as easy as removing a paper battery tab, using the keypad to tell the basestation that you are installing a new device and naming it from a list once the basestation announces that a new device has been detected. The preinstalled double sided tape makes mounting the sensors easy. Our cabin has numerous unfinished roughhewn wood surfaces and I decided to mount sensors that had to be on those surfaces with the included screws. I didn’t try the included self-adhesive on the roughhewn wood which, may have worked perfectly.SimpliSafe tells you how far away you can mount sensors like the glass break and motion sensors but it was less clear about how high to mount them given the space I was working in or, for the glass break in particular, the angular range that it could work with. For example, if you have windows on opposite sides of a room with no option to mount the sensor in the middle, can it detect glass breaking behind it or beside it?SimpliSafe sensors are relatively inexpensive, and, as such, perhaps an extra sensor or two isn’t a bad thing.The App is easy to set up and use and definitely slanted to the easy side rather than the comprehensive side. That said, if a sensor were to drop off the app will alert you to that. I am not looking forward to changing batteries but would rather that to running wires through an older structure.SimpliSafe has done a great job making system purchase, installation and operation easy and straightforward. They even sent me an e-mail letting me know that the county where my cabin is located requires a form and payment to be completed and sent to authorize monitoring and, more specifically, response. Not only did they tell me about it, they sent me the exact link to the form. They also let me know that no paperwork or fee was required for the fire monitor.The cabin can be a relatively harsh environment with high humidity in the summer and relatively cold nights. I am hoping the sensors, base station and keypad are rugged enough to function for years to come.If you are looking at one of these systems, read all you can to understand what you can and can’t do with and without SimpliSafe’s monitoring options. Watch or read about sensor placement and plan your own install. I don’t think you have to become an alarm expert but each install has its own challenges. I found plenty of good information available from a lot of sources on the Internet to address those challenges. I have not interacted with SimpliSafe’s customer service at this point and can’t comment on that aspect of the product.Overall, I believe I made a good decision for my family and have only positive things to say about the installation and operation of my SimpliSafe system.",,Excellent security system! Easy to install .The best thing is the ability to monitor system with the phone app and receive text and email alerts and ability to arm/disarm.Customer service is the best with virtually no wait and talented reps.

The set up of the mini was FAR EASIER than the outside cams. I had this thing set up in less than 5 minutes. Picture is good. Sound is LOUD which is what I was looking for.The app however needs some work to support this style of camera. The app works decently for the BlinkXT cameras and functionality, which is motion for most users. As in you get a notification that there is motion, it records, and you watch the recording or live as you please. but it is clunky to get into the Blink Mini for the purpose of continuous viewing which is my intention for this camera, like a baby monitor. Like many other Americans now working from home with a full house of kids, I wanted to use this to assist with keeping an eye on the kids as I worked and record those cute moments. I wanted to use this to visualize a blind spot that I can’t see from the office. I tried mounting it from the ceiling and realized you can’t rotate the video. Mounting on the wall was a little problematic, I couldn’t quite get the right angle needed.Another quirk to the app is if you switch to another app and then come back to the Blink app, you have to hit the play button to resume viewing.All in all, these are minor issues specific to my use of the camera which is why I have it five stars anyway.Hey amazon/Blink, it would be an awesome feature if you’d allow the integration of this camera with Alexa so we can “drop in” and talk through the Echo Dot. Just saying.",I love this lil camera!! Easy to install! Only took 5 min and it works great!! Highly recommend this!!,Great price and product. Connected very easily to my existing Blink system. I am not happy with having to pay for storage after trial ends.,"This is a great little camera monitor. Pros: easy set up, easily managed with your smart phone, clear image quality with motion detection. Can be set up to arm and record at any time. I bought this to use in my master bedroom by my desk where I keep sensitive information.Cons: if you are using it with another Blink product and you arm 24/7 then the other Blink unit also needs to be armed which is an issue because my other unit uses 2 AA batteries. There is no timer on the app to set up a time to arm which would by useful because I sometimes forget to arm at night. It has good night vision quality. It needs to be plugged in so is a problem if you put it in a place (i.e. bedroom closet) if there is no outlet. Because of this, it is difficult to make the camera more hidden (if you are looking for a nanny camera for example).Overall it is easy to use and I would recommend it for a basic home security camera.","SO...I rarely write reviews but was so amazed by this camera I wanted to let others know. I bought the camera after using the Ring indoor camera for twice the price and it made a constant clicking noise with the filter adjustment to light in the room that was a known issue Ring told me and not a defect. I've tried all the other brands out there WYZE, etc and disappointed with all. Then I tried the Blink Mini which I thought was a good price. The setup was a breeze, up and running in 30 seconds. The app is responsive and user friendly. My wifi is sloooow but it still loaded a 1080p HD quality view w hen I accessed it from my mobile app. My favorite feature is the night vision. All my previous cameras just showed a dark room or shadows but this camera shows a clear and crisp picture in pitch black darkness. Very pleased with this and you can't go wrong here.

The night vision works great the the motion detector is very good. I would say almost too good so select the level that works for you. At its highest setting the motion detector will activate if a bug crosses its field of vision. This can affect your battery life. The only thing I would improve is a longer battery life. At the settings I have the Toucan on, I hand to recharge it about once every three weeks. Not a major issue but it be nice to have a long lasting battery. Still, I would highly recommend this camera.",I got this in the other day and it’s great! I have them set up around my house for some extra security and we love it.

I have bought and set up complex networks for my two properties, as well as for friends and relatives. When I first saw a claim that a camera could have 6-month battery life, I was skeptical. Either that's not true, or the picture quality is very low. After extensive testing, I've found that not to be the case at all. Besides being truly simple to set up - with a phone app and Q code, I was in business within 5 minutes - it takes razor-sharp video in both bright and dim conditions. My battery tests indicate that it uses less than 3% of charge per week, which means it will probably last more than the 6 months promised (tune in later for updates).The best part of all is that, without the need for a charge cord, you are really free to mount just about anywhere. I have mine mounted in an attic - where I don't have electricity - looking down at my driveway. I never could have got such a wide-angle view from anywhere else in my house.All in all, this is a great little camera and a terrific price.","If you've seen the name brand ""Arlo"", this is basically the same thing at a fraction of the cost and no need to pay for cloud storage. The camera was very easy to set up and sync to the free app Adorcam. It came with a USB charging cable, but you have to supply the charging brick and a micro SD card if you want to be able to save and record video.Picture quality is pretty good, but becomes very pixelated if you zoom on any image. Its best used within 30 feet or so from where you mount if you want thee best resolution. It also needs to be relatively close to the wifi router or you will need a wifi repeater to extend your signal.The night vision is really good. I was surprised at the quality of the night images.Motion detection can be a bit weird. In the app you can set it to all motion or only ""human"" movement. I have mine set to all, and I only have one complaint: there is a delay in the time it picks up movement and the time it starts recording. For all intents and purposes, I think I would still have all the images I need, but it's a bit annoying. It is also a possibility that the angle at which my camera is pointed, but it did it a bit during table height testing too. I do like that the app let's you customize the length of each recorded video segment in case you want to save SD card space and battery life. It really makes everything customizable. I have been leaving mine on max battery saving setting but also goofing with watching live feeds (which zaps battery more) and its is still sitting at 100% for the last 7 days its been on. It also allows you to speak through the camera from the app live feed.Ultimately, this camera with the free app works really great and is definitely worth the price. I'll probably get one or two more to hang in other locations around the house.","Nice wireless camera with great features. Setup was very easy and was put into use within minutes.Download the Adorcam app prior to plugging it in as it'll ask to pair with wifi as soon as you plug it in. Pairing with wifi was simple. Battery came about 50% charged and took a maybe a couple hours to get to 100%. Camera came with charging cable, but we needed to supply USB wall plug in charger. We used one from an old android cell phone.I'm using it as a driveway alarm notification in an area we don't have electrical access. Motion sets off the notification via the app. I haven't had any false notifications yet.One feature I really like is the ability to manually set off an audible alarm. It's loud and would be useful to scare off an intruder. We own numerous SV3C cameras and wish the manual alarm was a feature on their wifi cameras.Camera is set to record upon motion detection and is stored on a micro SD card we bought separate. The app will also take a picture of initial motion. Battery life has been great so far. Camera is easy to mount and take down to charge.So far we're very pleased with functionality and will be buying more to use as trailcams to record wildlife in areas we have no electricity.","I own several wireless cameras that I have e placed around my complex to keep an eye on suspicious neighbors This camera truly has a user-friendly interface as well as being 100% wire free. You get the camera, mounting screws A charger and small instruction booklet stating on how to use it. One thing that I was surprised at was that the camera had a 39% charge right out of the box, all the other wireless cameras that I have purchased have had at least a 60% charge. No complaints though. Another thing that really surprised me about this camera is that it uses a different type of charger. Instead of using a micro-USB it uses a Type C charger. To some people this may not seem like a big deal but to others it might be beneficial to have a camera that shares the same type of charging interface. This camera does have the option for the user to add an external SD card for extra storage, Videos can be formatted directly from the ADORICAM app to free up space if necessary.Now let’s talk about the app, the app on Google play is called ADORICAM. It is a very simple user-friendly app that connects with the camera and your Wi-Fi connection. To set up the camera you are required to hold the camera around five inches from your phone until you hear the camera chime, assuming that you put in your Wi-Fi password correctly the camera should be connected. When connected it has numerous useful features such as an alarm button that sounds a loud sired, Video recording and still photo image capture.Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and am glad that I added this camera to my surveillance system, now only time will tell on how it holds up.",342,129,https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Security-SV3C-Rechargeable-Detection/dp/B08X6HJRF9/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=adt+security+cameras&qid=1640230238&sr=8-13

You can move the camera around from the app which is really cool and if you put it in the right place you can cover a ton of area. The solar panel holds the batteries and there is room inside of 6 18650's which is probably a bit of overkill, it comes with 3 installed and room for 3 more, unless it's dark for days on end the 3 batteries should be plenty, but always good to have options. The motion detection is spot on and starts quickly, works much better than my Ring doorbell. Overall awesome high end security camera.",Amazing 👏 technology advanced security camera..Swivel using app is incredible coupled with Zoom feature is outstanding...than on top of that the Solar charging as you can see in my picture is by far one of the best features....Totally wireless and with the WiFi feature...Pictures are only in SD that I took but it has the HD feature by simply tapping in app...Alert settings are amazing as seen in my pics. Without question a bargain for the money! Easy install and connection!,"Cameras work as advertised (I have 2). I ordered extra batteries (18650) from Amazon (separately) and added them in to the cameras. As with all cameras, finding a good mounting position is the hardest part. This one needs to have a good wi-fi signal, which means you will likely have to add an outdoor wi-fi extender or outdoor wired LAN antenna, or indoor wi-fi extenders on inside walls closest to outside camera location. I ordered wifi-extenders (TP-Link AC750 WiFi Extender RE230) separately also on AMZN, and setup up the extenders and cameras inside, prior to installing cameras outside. Had to move extenders to various locations inside the house to get best connection to camera and to base wi-fi. SOLIOM+ App seems to work pretty good, and camera stays connected to wi-fi. All wi-fi problems so far have been with my signal & extenders, not the camera as far as I can tell. My camera (and solar panel) are in shade under trees, and we have had several dark stormy days, but after several weeks I have had no battery charging issues, and cameras have stayed online all the time, day and night. I also added memory cards (SD) to each camera before installation. I record all video to SD.I tried to activate the free (7-day?) Trial Cloud video storage via the SOLIOM+ app on my phone, but it just didn't work. I wanted to test that Cloud storage before sending any money for a paid account, but that's on hold until I can try to get the free Trial to work. Camera video quality is great, day and night -- I use the night vision mode by turning off the cameras light and use IR. Pan/Tilt works good, but you should know that is is in 'fixed increments' when you hit the app p/t buttons. There is no optical zoom, but you can 'zoom' in the app with normal phone 2-finger touchscreen operation. Also, there is no way to view video through any other means other than their SOLIOM+ app on the phone. A firmware upgrade would be greatly appreciated that allows standard network access from camera to software like Blue Iris. Most camera makers seem to have proprietary software or apps so this maker is not unusual. 1 drawback is (at maximum movement sensitivity) camera misses some activity (cars and people in driveway). There is also a 'glitch' (I would call it), where motion is activated just fine, but recording stops at your preset time limit, even though motion continues. There will be no added video either on the original clip or on additional clips. All additional motion is just not recorded. On the other camera which is viewing only yard, (versus driveway, cars, people), motion is activated for leaves falling and bugs flying by. None but the most expensive (several times $cost of this one) have great motion control so this isn't a complaint given the price of these cameras, just be aware of some of the limitations of less expensive cameras like this one. So far this camera has operated in weather from 80's down to upper 20's (F) and in lots of rain without any problem. 1 big problem is that when recording to SD card, you can only *view* the saved video on your phone (in the SOLIOM+ app), but you cannot download the video and save it to your phone or anywhere else -- you have to open the camera, take out the SD card, then copy the video clips that way - which is pretty ridiculous. That is probably the only reason NOT to get this camera. I assume, but have not tested it, that video on their cloud service would be downloadable to a PC or something. There are video capture apps for android that may help to capture the video while you play it on your phone, but I have also not tried any of that. SOLIOM+ app should be updated ASAP to allow downloading video from SD to phone storage.","We love the pan, tilt, zoom option and the video quality is great. The setup is extremely easy. You can add 3 extra 18650 batteries for backup power but it's not really needed. You can store/review the files on your micro SD card or the cloud. If you want to use the cloud, they have 3 different price plans as shown in the pics. So far so good, really happy with this purchase.",,3424,1,https://www.amazon.com/SOLIOM-S600-Outdoor-Security-PTZ-IP-Camera-Activated-Spotlight/dp/B083TX4J2D/ref=sr_1_11?keywords=adt+security+cameras&qid=1640230238&sr=8-11

Totally 4K!,Great System,You may need extra base stations if you’re house is big and made with stucco walls .,Birds eye in the sky,We love these,"I'm coming off of a frustration of trying to get Amcrest cams to work with the Synology NAS. After beating my head against the wall trying to get it all to work, I gave up 2 weeks ago. Frustrated with trying to keep the wireless cams online, I yanked them and threw them in the garbage (literally). I purchased a Pro 3 and a Pro 2 separately along with the Ultra Smarthub to start off. Kind of sticking my toe in the water, I ran this for a week. Setup was ridiculously simple. Not over stating either. Performance exceeded my expectation by a lot. The big issue for people is loading speed. I'll just say before I had the Amcrest WiFi I had Ring which was even more frustrating. Not a good experience at all. Really long load times or just hanging. So far with Arlo, I can trace every issue directly to something on my network. I added 2 more Pro 3's just to make sure I wasn't just experiencing an anomoly. The network can keep up with the cameras no problem. Snappy response to load. Does Arlo ever hang or slow perform. ABSOLUTLEY! But very very infrequently once you get clean WIFI. Move that router as far as you can from the Arlo HUB. Remember, Arlo uses it's own little private network, so you just need to provide the hub with clear wired connectivity. Also make sure your cameras have as much unobstructed path to the hub. I have a Camera on the other side of my 3,000 square foot house. I have 4 bars. I added the Ultra to my now 5 camera set up. Wow! Even more gorgeous! Great Cam, field of view is amazing, covers my whole front house including the porch. I would recommend to a friend. I do have to be honest, the Pro 2 is very very disappoining. Color bleeding is bad at night. Night vision is pretty much unusable. I bought all my cameras but one refurbished. No issues at all, perfectly packed with all accessories. All pieces came EARLY. yea!!! I absolutely love this system so far!!!!","We had a little security scare a few weeks ago and decided to purchase a security camera system. I have to say I'm super impressed. Sharp video quality, local storage capability, security light, motion sensor, siren, e911, easy install, two-way communication and HomeKit compatibility. What more could you want!? The local storage and HomeKit compatibility is what really sold me though. I only wish the HomeKit integration was a little deeper (Secure Video please!!)...but HomeKit integration is at least there which is was a requirement for me. Some of the other reviewers complaints seem like they're rooted in poor wifi signal...you're dealing with 4K video so the units obviously need strong signal outdoors. I've had zero issues. Definitely feeling safer and would totally reccomend!!",The video is great if the cameras have a really good signal but the videos are Vero slow in loading if the signal is less then 3 full bars,"The Arlo Ultra camera system I had recently purchased has worked like a charm. I am now able to have a peace of mind while sleeping or not home. I was able to locate a camera fairly far and high up on a pole and this monitors the front of the property as well as whom enters our culdesac. In return, if someone has problems or a break in within the neighborhood. We could possibly review the footage and perhaps catch a license plate if they are not on foot . Although the cameras have been installed for one week exactly. Very little issues with them. Just be sure your wireless range can handle the distance unless you buy a wireless repeater to extend the range.","We have 6 of these with 2 home docks and we love them. They show great picture quality and the battery life last pretty good as long as you turn off the notifications every time it detects something. We bought 6 from Best Buy but we recently had to purchase another one because my daughter knocked it off the window and it broke something. This was easy to sync to the home base and start using right away. They run off wifi, we have really bad internet and these still work okay. You can speak over them from the app but with our slow wifi it’s hard for you to hear someone talking back or it’s delayed a little.",781,57,https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Ultra-Wire-Free-Spotlight-Compatible/dp/B08D7WPBXV/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=adt+security+cameras&qid=1640230238&sr=8-10

Basically for 8 cameras and 1tb harddrive,the deal cant be beat. I didn't want wireless cameras cause I find those can cause problems so I decided on a wired unit. And the cabling definitely is tedious but the come with quite long cables so that gave me a little more freedom for that. The dvr unit was also a bit of a process, it works best with an ethernet cable connection, so setting that up initially did take some time. There is a bit of a guided set up which helps. But once that was done I had no problems remotely viewing my set up through the manufacturers app. I did run into a few questions and the manufacturer was really helpful so I was pleased about that. If you have the patience , this is a great system for the money, it has literally all of the features I wanted plus no subscription required to view remotely , and that was one of my top priorities when searching for a security system.",,"Great Product.

It come with remote view on PC and mobile devices with audio supportive, motion detection and email alerts, setup the NVR by mouse or the remote control, IP66 weatherproof cameras. The IP pro app on the iPhone very user friendly. I like the user interface was very simple and clean. I also found the signal repeater was a great function. Each camera can act as repeater and pass the signal back to the NVR. This way you don't need to put your NVR at the center of the all camera. I also see there was audio icon on each camera screen. This security camera come with motion sensor alert. Best part it's wireless so no more installation of long cable. The motion detection can be set in the system to record when there is an object moving in the recording area, and immediately send a video screenshot to you by email. You can also customize the detect area and sensitivity to reduce false alerts.

The camera battery that is rechargeable can sustain a very long time without needing recharged. (6 months)It has held a charge without being connected to electricity OR THE solar panel for over three months, and it is still only 1/2 power on the battery scale. When using it outside, two points of importance, one, the solar panel will keep it constantly charged so electricity will never be needed after the initial charge up. And also the color black is more important to be used on the outside so that in darkness it does not show up as well as if it was white. The camera has PTZ that is accessible from your phone to be able to adjust the camera, and the app allows you to go back in the history and pull up events that occurred usually up to one or two months, depending on the size of the SD card that you put into the camera. Also the camera has a much better picture if HD is pushed on the camera settings. Wifi is necessary if you need to access the camera remotely. You cannot go wrong with the purchase of this camera, the quality of the pictures is excellent and the response time of the camera to record is excellent.","This camera is a HUGE upgrade from the older one that I have from the same company. The video is more clear and the wi-fi extender is EXCELLENT! I have a slower internet and the extender is very nice - no freezing up or slowing down. Being able to move the camera around is an awesome improvement too, keeps me from having to install multiple cameras. It was very easy to connect with their app and set everything up, maybe 10-15 minutes (mainly because after connecting it needs to download a firmware update.) Even installing it outside was super easy, four screws to your base and then put camera on it and tighten down with little screw tabs. If you are looking for a camera but not wanting a huge investment or complicated installation, this one is perfect for that! I highly recommend it!","- Design, build and paint quality is excellent- Since our side patio, yard & walk in area is very narrow and long, the camera can pan the whole side of the house. It also can pan straight down to alleviate any blind spots.- If someone comes to our side entry door we can pan to see who it is and use the speaker (two way speaker) to ask any questions before deciding whether we should open the door. Of course it's also great to see if Amazon or other vendor packages have been delivered. (Panning is done through the use of an icon on your mobile device)- Battery life is very good. In 3 weeks of use the battery is at 85%. (I intentionally left off the solar panel to make sure the battery was good.)- I did encounter one minor problem involving still images not being viewable after the camera detected motion and recorded video. The company was contacted via email and within 24 hours asked for more information. After giving them the info, they responded again within 24 hours with their explanation. (Nothing wrong with the camera … a software app update will be upcoming which should fix the issue.) After working in the computer support area all of my life, I am always impressed by companies which actually care about customers and respond quickly. Kudos to their support team!This is a very nice and functional security camera which I would purchase again.","This come with everything you need, except for the optional memory card. Charge it before you install, and with the solar panel set up to face the sun, you never have to worry about it running out of battery. No monthly subscription required which I love. You can add a microSD card to save footage. The pan and tilt functions work nicely from the app which allows you to expand your view. Motion detection works a little too well, so I would get alerts if strong winds move plants/tree shadows.

After 6 weeks of use the Battery bar still shows full !!!,"Best buy, value for money, it has everything",Perfect wireless camera,Tough little gem of a camera.,It's pretty good.,"This camera is absolutely wonderful! From when I first opened the box I was very impressed with the packaging and the high quality of materials used to make this product. I could see that much thought and consideration was put into the design. The software installation was a breeze! Once I downloaded the app and turned on the camera, the app immediately recognized the camera and just a few simple steps later my camera was ready to work. I was also very happy to see that I had a few options for mounting the camera and what really made my day was that I was able to mount the camera without having to drill any permanent holes in the walls. (there is also the option to mount it via a screw and hanging it). Once the mount is secure on the wall, attaching the camera to it with the built-in magnet is easy and ball design allows you to adjust the camera angle or remove the camera at any given time.Immediately after I completed the setup and installation, I get real-time notifications when there is any motion detection. As long as I have a stable connection on my phone, I have the option to use the intercom function to speak to whoever is at my door. What I really like about the notification function is that I can go back and view screenshots as well as video. The quality of the picture and video is very good and the night vision function works incredibly well. I attached a picture to this review of my two dogs in a completely blacked out room.The waterproof design is also nice to have although it was not a necessity for me now, it may come in handy some day.I have used the camera indoors at times to check in on my dogs and now mostly use it for the front and rear entry to my house.Now what really surprised me most with this camera is the battery life. I was very skeptic to the claims made in the listing but now after nearly 6 weeks of daily usage and the battery indicator shows full bars! Well, color me impressed!!!Overall it is great for me to be able to see who is at my door, whether I am home or not.One thing I would like to add and I hope the seller can see this comment is that the font on the instruction manual is very very small. I recommend enlarging the font so that it can be easily read by old timers like me.","I recently planned to go out of country for few days and wanted to have a camera to keep an eye on my house while I am away. Once the product was received, my daughter could do the set up in just few minutes using my phone. I installed this in the front porch using the included stickers. Magnetic attachment is super easy to bring in for charging. I didn't want any wiring and any hard installation in the wall. So the set up was really easy. Location of the device is about 40ft from the router. I charged it to 100% though it came pre charged. Picture quality is super clear. Night vision is perfect. Monitored the view from different country for days and the camera still was 100% charged. Very happy with the purchase. Motion activation is perfect, sends a message to my phone. I haven't used the SD card option yet.",,"I know the saying you get what you paid for, and I found this camera to be a great value. The price and reviews were what sold me. My experience is as follows.......First fast delivery with prime. Received and installed 5/7/2019 ...Then my device was fully charged and undamaged when received. Simple directions. Great pics and night vision, easy installation. Motion detection works well as well as the person to person intercom. The camera is also (in my opinion) of good quality, heavy duty. I would say that especially after I dropped twice with clumsy hands (not on purpose) in stalling memory card. Maybe 4’.5” above floor. As far as the app, it works fine , I do wish that you could send videos or pics to email since it is connected to my internet with out taking memory card out... but this is not a deal breaker. I will be going on trip and will test long distance receiving of notifications. One of the neighbors’ kids set it off and I was notified pretty quick. I show that the camera is running at 52% internet signal because of installation distance from router, and still get impressive results. I read somewhere that the battery will or could last to upwards to 120 days in standby operation, .... after trip I plan on making another purchase... I may or may not get a router signal booster, but I am very happy with my decision and experience with this camera. I will post and update on battery performance later when I have to charge again but we all know that the amount of time on live feeds and motion detection will need to be taken into an account... P.S. I will post pics soon.","Surprisingly, this is a pretty good quality camera. I like that it alerts you when theres any movement detected. It recorded and take pictures when theres movement. With that being said you can put an SD card in to save your pictures and videos but theres also a cloud where you can choose to pay monthly or yearly. So you have options to either choose SD or a Cloud monthly/yearly subscription.UPDATE on battery life: I received this item on june 6th but I didnt put it up until june 10th and right now is july 6th. So the battery is at 18% as of right now. So if you use the camera as often as I did(every time theres a notifications due to high sensitivity movements) of course it'll take up the battery. It did however notify me that its 18% and it needs to be charged or it will automatically shut off. Still not bad. Planning on buying another to rotate while the other one is charging. Picture quality is pretty good.On another note, there's a solar for this camera that can be charged without having to take it down to plug in to charge. Less worries about the battery being low and it'll continously charge throughout the day.",13997,2,https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Rechargeable-Detection-Waterproof-compatible/dp/B07PM2NBGT/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=adt+security+cameras&qid=1640230238&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&smid=A25N8USV7RG83C&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFKV0k2OVBYVU5SVUQmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA1MzM0OThJVU9aSjkxVVhKOEkmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDYzMTEzNjJPRFJFOUNTSVgyNzQmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl

I can honestly say this product is easy to install and is of great quality for under $100. I have mounted this camera in my backyard which is mounted to a tree overlooking my back door and and side alley. My camera is mounted up about 15 feet. This camera has great wireless range, excellent battery life, and picture quality is clear.Installation is easy too. Just charge the battery and follow the easy step guide which will guide you through the process. Took less than five minutes to set up. An app need to be downloaded which took a couple minutes.As for installation, just use the easy mounting template then install. The longest time for install is to setup the ladder and then it took me less than 10 min to complete the entire process.All said, I am pleased with the overall ease of installation, quality, and how it performs with the wireless network. I give this product a solid five because it exceeded my expectations.","My first camera. I have seen some from other friends but too pricey. I don’t want the Ring ones because again, pricey. I went for this one and very impressed may I say. Quality is superb! Took me about 10 minutes to mount and install with the app, not kidding, 10 minutes tops. The only thing I didn’t like was that it’s not easy to adjust the position. You have to unscrew little screws and move it, if it was easier to move this would be the PERFECT camera but it’s a great and I mean GREAT camera. You will not go wrong if you buy this. Imma buy another 2 for my front door and patio. They’re awesome!","I have been a devoted Soliom user since I bought my first solar wireless security camera several years ago. I had always wanted to have security cameras, but didn't want to get involved with running and concealing wiring and Soliom was the solution with its combination of solar power and rock solid wifi connections.While the S90 and S600 are excellent products and still in use on my property, after multiple summers of 110+ degree days which caused no problem, the B10 takes it to a whole new level. In the first place, the footprint is significantly smaller and the unit less heavy than it's predecessors, yet retains all of the functionality and perfomance is even more enhanced. Because it is small and lightweight, installation is a breeze, and it quickly and easily paired with my router, although it is a fair distance away. As soon as it ws paired, I began to see a brilliant HD picture and a quick test revealed that the 2-way intercom was loud and clear on both ends. Even better, the false alarms often triggered on previous models by tree branches blowing in the wind, were virtually eliminated by the new PIR smart technology. This is enhanced even further by the new ability to program times of operation and a siren that can be set, along with a bright light, to alert the homeowner and to frighten away possible intruders. As with all of my Soliom cameras, it charges fully each day under our bright desert sunlight, and seems to retain its charge even on cloudy days, although I have not had this long enough to use it through the Winter, but based on my experience with my other Soliom cameras it should be more than adequate for a stretch of cloudy days. In the few instances when I have needed some technical support, I found Soliom customer servcie to be both competent, prompt and genuinely concerned with customer satisfaction. For all of the above reasons, I have given the Soliom B10 a five star review and recommend it without hesitation to anyone needing a solar powered wireless security camera, at a very reasonable price.","If your looking for a Solar powered, 1080p, Wifi Security Camera, Spotlight, Color Night Vision, Two-Way Talk, Siren Alarm, and Motion detector camera at an affordable price, this is it!! Soliom added an 10ft extension cable to mount the solar panel away from the camera. You can practically mount the camera anywhere now.. so many possibilities!

It has been totally re-engineered. Take it from someone who owns all the different cameras Blink had to offer since day one and had to get on a waiting list to get the very first one. So, I should know what iam talking about. This new camera no longer has the push down and pull system to open the back to install batteries. It has a large screw that you simply unscrew with a included tool to open the back of the camera which is really nice. Once you open the back and install the included batteries scan the small QR code inside the camera threw the blink app it will scan to find the camera once that is done it will automatically do a firmware update. After that you are ready to install your new blink camera. Also noticed the sound is much louder and more clear then the other cameras. This is good if two people are talking in a low voice you can hear what they are saying. Has brighter clearer night vision. Nice clear voice communication with two way talk. Alot stronger wifi signal to sink module and from sink module to camera. Sharp, clear, bright, and colorful HD vision during the day. I noticed before I wrote this review that some people only gave this camera 2 or 3 stars. Like the guy who is complaining about software issues. Well if you follow the directions you would not have that problem. Let the camera finish its firmware update. Duh ! Also, if you have been a Blink customer for a while and want to add this camera to your current system. You do not have to pay for cloud storage you are grandfathered in. After you add this camera to your existing system it will actually tell you this ! The front of the camera has a all new face with a very smooth and shinny surface iam sure to help combat the weather and give it a more high tec look. Their is no longer a switch inside the camera to turn on or off the blue recording light located on the front of the camera. It's is all done threw the app which is really nice as well. They really did a good job in re-engineering this camera and listened to customer complaints about their past cameras and went threw and fixed every issue. I would definitely buy this camera again ! UPDATE : 09-25-20 After using this camera for a couple of days. And as other reviewers have noted that this camera only has a 25 foot motion trigger ! Anything further than 25 feet it will NOT record when motion is present. So if you need a camera get the Blink XT2 for the further range. This camera will only be good for specific areas like door or window that are within the 20 to 25 foot range from the camera.","It's super easy. Works great. Setup was simple. It works exactly as advertised. What I didn't know for sure is that the batteries are just high quality AA batteries. So when they die, you can get some rechargeable ones and just rotate them through the thing. I'm going to order a couple more. They are pretty great. *Edit-A nice person took the time to let me know it's best not to replace w/ traditional AA batteries.","So far everything is as advertised. Setup was a breeze and the image quality is great - especially when set to “best.” I really appreciate the custom activity zones that you can set, as well as the ability the turn off the led light.In terms of improvement, the included mount is pretty basic. For better or worse the mount snaps into the back of the camera module. This makes installing it relatively easy, but also means anyone could detach it with a firm pull. I’ve noticed that there are upgraded mounts that you buy, but haven’t had a chance to fully check those out yet.Lastly, I noticed another reviewer mentioned subscription pricing, but it’s a bit misleading. Yes, there is cloud storage that you can pay for, but there are multiple levels, including a free plan, as well as a basic plan for $3/month. Also, the paid plans don’t start until 2021. More importantly, What this camera has, that the XT2 doesn’t, is local storage. If you’re big on privacy, and don't want to store videos on the cloud, you can attach a USB drive to the blink module and save your videos there (see photo which shows the usb drive). There’s no fee for saving your videos locally - you can still get alerts and watch your video feed live for free.",What an awesome product...total install took 25 minutes. I put 3 camera’s up outside to monitor my summer home. One of the camera’s I places on a pole in the yard pointing at the roof so I can monitor snow fall and snow melt roof system.

SIMPLE.,Great quality,"I hope this review can save everyone some time! Amazon's al.go.rhythms philter out sub optimal critiques. So...If you're looking for an outdoor security camera that isn't this product, I highly recommend it! It'll work with a USB extension cord, no days. I spent hours trying to get it to work. Technical support is responsive if you enjouy a call weeks after you've purchased something else, and being sad.","We originally purchased 2 of the Zmodo cams, to keep an eye on our mountain cabin while we were away. We were so impressed that we bought 4 more! We now have cams to watch our barn and horses as well as our parking area and gate/driveway. Several people have had problems with theft, but with our security cams, we have not had anything come up missing or vandalized. We've had a couple of ""turnarounds"", in the driveway, but as soon as they see the cam (and our ""you're a star, smile!"" signs), they hightail it to easier pickins. It's very entertaining to watch the old videos, too.We highly recommend the Zmodo cams; they are easy to setup, easy to install and very dependable. Our original two cams have been in continuous operation, for over a year, with nary a hiccup. Zmodo cams are outstanding!","I moved recently into an old house and eventually found that someone was throwing animals down my well. I ordered the set of 2, one to watch the back where the well is and one to watch my front door and work shop. It's nice to be able to check up on things an scroll back through the motion detection markers. Worth the price and piece of mind. They took me an hour or two to mount in safe spots and run the power cables into my house but it was certainly worth it.I hope I never need them again but I will be so greatful if I do.","EXTREMELY satisfied and happy with this purchase. I currently have a Zmodo doorbell camera, so linking the cameras was a SIMPLE and easy process. Total time of installation, hook up to the viewing live footage was LITERALLY eight minutes. Took longer to drag the ladder out. The whole process would have taken even less time if camera location was next to power source...but even that was easy. I DO DEFINITELY recommend this package of cameras. As a matter of fact I am ordering two more for the other side of my house.TIP: If camera location will be further than five feet from power source, order a micro USB extension plug/cord (only cost a few dollars on Amazon) at the time of ordering.Hope this helped.

We have used Insteon cameras,Bought this to monitor our front door while away on a trip. Delivery of the item was on time and I got it set up on my android phone in less than a half hour. We bought a 32GB micro SD card for it and positioned the camera to view outside the office window towards our front porch and the picture is very clear at all times of the day! I am able to receive the alerts and view them from my phone and/or laptop. I am also able to view more than the 6 second clip if I want to watch the full footage of the movement. It is easy to save the 6 second clip to the SD card; however it doesn't save the full footage. But I found out that if I leave that clip in that day's activities then I can still view the footage. I have set both the sensitivity and alert frequency settings to low and it still picks up passing vehicles but I am okay with that since I am able to delete the unneeded clips easily. I am amazed and pleased that I can be hundreds of miles away and still be able to monitor my front porch. And it's considerably cheaper than the Ring or Nest products. I am very pleased with this product!!!,This thing is amazing. Picture is super clear and detailed. The only thing that would make it better is if it told me the temp in my toddlers room (I use it as a baby monitor). Sound quality is great.

Voice out of the camera is good quality. Changing settings and schedule of monitoring is easy, but a little more limited than others. This camera meets all of my requirements for a simple security solution, and I would take this for indoor use above any other cameras we have used, and the price is considerably less than the manufactures listed above.

Better than the rest!,Tech support with Jaden,"I've installed several POE systems for other homes as a handyman on the side. I've wanted something for my house and thought I'd try Amcrest. I've tried Lorex and Ring and other brands. Each has their own app and interface when using the back end of the system. Some harder than others.I installed this system myself. Four cameras total. (as seen in first pic)It came with 60ft of Cat6 cable where some of the others systems come with 100ft. Luckily I had reel of Cat6 cable of 1000ft extra and can make my own cables because the two cameras from the back of the house barely reached to the entrance 1"" hole for the wires. I was able to have a junction box to continuing the wiring to the NVR system box. As you can see from the photos I wired four of the cables into a 1/2 PVC pipe up from the ceiling edge of the walls down to where I have the NVR.Just like any system it takes time to get to know how it works. I will say the platform was so much easier than other NVR systems I've used when trying to setup the network/p2p/firewall and ports from routers. (side note: comcast was a little difficult at first to open the port forwarding due to their ""cloud"" of working from the router.) But after a few tries I was able to get the port forwarding to work to get the app to work outside of the house when using the phone.Quality is outstanding! But due to each system, this one couldn't keep up with having four, 4k cameras so it would blank out 1-2 of the cameras. In another review, a buyer did mention this issue with her system. I will say this is common with any system. It turns out you would have to spend on the $1000 system which has more processing power to run all cameras in 4k. This would bog the system on any brand. SO it is recommended to lower the resolutions. So in my case I put three of the cameras to 5m (1080p) and just my driveway to 8m (4k). I also was able to change the frame rate from 15 to 25fps on the 3 cams. This allowed camera with most traffic to capture more in detail but not bog the NVR.The LED night vision is outstanding as well. (see photos) Don't get confused, doesn't have a LED light, but its a LED working through IR.All the cameras did have a mic built in. But I wouldn't rate it good or bad since the app audio playback isn't so great but the system itself does pick up pretty well if you can get it straight from the drive. You can def. hear from about 50ft when someone is walking to the mailbox across the street.I could say a lot more but over all I am very happy with this system compared to other brands I've installed or had. I was tired of people walking up and the ""Ring Doorbell/stickCam not capturing faces or only people walking away. Or just never working at all. Also the IR was terrible or blurry. But Amcrest has won me over.I will say side note I did notice that my iphone on playback worked really well without being jittery or slow or the scrubbing was fine. But on ipad or android it was way jittery and I thought had to do with my frame rate on the NVR system itself but found out that wasn't the case. Has to do with the app on whatever phone its on. SO don't blame the system itself for its faulty playback. It runs just fine if you view it from a HDMI TV or iphone 6 plus. I also was able to preview it from my desktop by typing the IP address in the browser which allowed me to control the NVR settings and view all cameras from my computer from my home network.I def. recommend this system with the turret cameras. Low profile and easy to install. I read also with the Amcrest system I can get the doorbell and include it to the NVR recording on my wireless home network which is awesome. So I may add that and do a review on that. But right now spent enough! Lastly it’s nice that I can create other users. Either as a viewer or another admin. So that’s a nice feature as well without someone messing the main login.Hope this helps for those who are wanting a 4k camera system with built in 2TB drive. Amazon has the best pricing! This goes a little more on other sites and that's without a hard drive. So Amazon def. has it beat.I got this for $559.99 plus tax out the door was $611.79I will do an update of how long a camera last for my system. Last install clients lorex, one of the 4k bullet cams already crapped out and not even 6 months. That was a $900 system. Client not wanting to deal with wait time and warranty, spent additional $140 for replacement.","When I bought this, I had owned an Amcrest Wifi camera for over two years as a baby monitor and have absolutely loved it. So it was an easy decision to try this DVR system. Still have only installed two of cameras due to the complexity of getting the others installed, but so far I’ve been very happy with first two cameras performance. The DVR system could be more updated and user friendly, especially for someone who’s never used a system like this. But after weeks of playing with it, adjusting the motion detection settings and such, I got better with it. Unfortunately I couldn’t get the motion detection to work 100% of the time the way I wanted it to because we don’t have rain gutters and the rain coming off the roof would always prematurely set it off the motion notifications.I did have issues with re-synchronizing the wifi cameras to the DVR after making changes fi my internet setup, but Amcrest Tech Support was awesome and quickly helped me resolve the issue.Overall, still will recommend this system and have plans to add more cameras.","If you are like me and don't mind paying a little more for a much higher quality product, this is the camera system for you. It is fairly easy to set up, although it's much easier to follow the online instructions versus the user manual that comes with it. You will need a wired connection to your router and an HDMI monitor to get started and then after the NVR is set up you can switch over to an ethernet to wifi device if it has a WPS button to pair it with your wireless router. The one wire connection to the cameras makes the installation of the cameras a breeze. The camera housings are very high quality with a decent range of adjustment. They also allow you to run the wire outside of the camera or through the center of the camera mount and into the wall. The video quality and night vision is superb, even picking up night time action at the end of my 100 foot long driveway. The NVR has all the features you would expect from a mid to high range system. The mobile app works as it should and gets you into live view quickly from anywhere you are. I do have a 600 Mbps connection, so I don't know if that could be a factor in the connectivity speed or not. Something to note when considering placement of this system is the NVR's fans are a little noisy, but they do keep the unit cool.","These cameras are fantastic. We almost bought another brand, but found these instead. Easy to install and work great. Have not failed us yet! The picture quality is better than the system through a company that was at our house previously. The app is really cool as well. Super easy to navigate once you figure it out. I gave the motion detection a 3 star because it was too sensitive if you have a flag or trees around. I tried decreasing the sensitivity and setting the grid for where you would like motion detected, and I could not get it to set. But not worth overlooking this system, for sure! Very pleased!","excellent customer support, could not have done this without him patient,knowledgeable,very fast also able to get cameras to detect movement at certain times of day,looking forward to buying more cameras since this was so easy cameras have very good coverage,so far so good thankyou amcrest",78,11,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-8-Megapixel-Weatherproof-Pre-Installed-NV4108E-IP8M-T2499EW4-2TB/dp/B07RYBHWZM/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=amcrest+security+camera&qid=1640230113&sr=8-20

A++ Recommended!!",Great quality camera with great price,Great Alternative To Ring.,Great Addon for home Security!,"I’ll start off by saying, I’ve installed hundreds of security cameras for clients, and probably half as many flood and/or security lights. I’ve personally never liked combo devices, as I’ve found there usually is a functionality trade off in one side of the device (camera is great, light is horrible, or vice versa.) So when I was given the opportunity to review this security camera and light combo at no cost, in exchange for an unbiased review, I jumped at that opportunity!First impressions: The hardware felt solid and sturdy. The included instructions were straight forward and included easy to follow along diagrams. If you feel comfortable with turning off the circuit breaker for the location where you are installing the light, and can attach three wires, you probably won’t have a problem installing this device. (Note: if you are uncomfortable, you should consult a qualified electrician for assistance.) The hardware install process took me 20min total, to remove the old floodlight and install this new one.First configuration: After the quick install, I was off to the configuration. The clear and easy to follow instructions included, explained how to download the app from the app store and get up and running quickly. I have an iPhone so the app was easy to find and download in the Apple App store. This was my first Armcrest Smart home device, so I needed to register for an account, which took just another minute to verify my email address.Once I paired the device with my phone/Armcrest account, I realized the device initially had some challenges communicating to “the cloud”. This was caused by the app/hardware developer deciding to utilize non-standard ports for communication to “the cloud.” I don’t know why the developer felt this was necessary (its not), and after I allowed the exception in my Firewall security settings (for both my phone and the hardware), I was up and running with no problems. (Note: If you don’t know what this means, don’t worry, you probably won’t be affected by it. If do you know what I’m talking about, enable SSL outbound over all TCP ports and you’ll be fine.)After the hardware device had a steady/consistent connection to the internet, the iOS app indicated that a firmware upgrade was needed. The app seamlessly guided me through the process and it was completed in about 3min.Usage: By default, push notifications for motion alerts are on. If you don’t have anything that moves in view of the camera, this is excellent. Unfortunate for me, I have two large trees that when blowing in the wind, triggered the alert. No biggie though, I was able to easily set up motion zones to ignore the trees, and only alert on the walkway. If motion is detected, not only do I get a push notification, I also am presented with a video clip of the event that triggered the vent! This is super handy if you want to know what happened in the past, or while you were not home, and don’t want to review lots of video footage.When its dark outside, and motion is detected, I have the device configured to turn on the flood lights. This is excellent not only when walking outside in the dark, but also a great deterrent for people who are not supposed to be there. The led lights are nice and bright and you can easily configure how long you want the flood lights to stay on after motion was detected. In the event you are alerted by motion and you turn on the live view and see something you don’t like, a single press of a button in the app sounds a very loud siren on the floodlight. It’s very loud and can be heard over two blocks away!I am excited to report this device changed my views on combo devices; it is possible to have both a great camera and great light in one package! In conclusion, this is an excellent consumer grade device with tons of options that make it a great buy.","There are so many great things with this Flood Light Camera that I find myself having trouble figuring out where to start. From the beginning of when I received it, in its great packaging, it could have fallen from 50 feet and still be ok, the protection of its packaging was great. As I took it all out, I noticed it even came with a hanger that you can use that holds it while you wire it into your house. I have never seen a floodlight come with that before and I have installed many! Wiring so simple. Hot, Neutral, and Ground and it is done! After I wired it to my house, I opened up the app, scanned the QR Code and I was able to see the cameras view instantly. Previously on flood lamps, you had to keep climbing ladders and making adjustments to sensitivity and length of time it stays on but with this, I was able to mount it, come down my ladder, and from my living room chair I can adjust ALL the settings from my phone. I already have several IP Cameras around my house in other locations and I have the Blue Iris Security Camera Software. I plugged in the IP address that the app so easily lists in its Device Information and Blue Iris was receiving a Great Live Video Feed in no time! In the Amcrest Smart Home App, I am able to view my driveway from anywhere in the world. I can choose where it should pick up a motion to record and how to notify me. Even when the Flood Lights are not on, the camera has GREAT IR lights and can see everything in the darkest of nights. When I get home there is no place that is dark, the lighting is L.E.D. Super Bright! With motion-activation turned on for the lights I have tried to sneak past it but it picks me up the minute I am in the line of sight from every angle. It is above my Garage and the split second I walk out of my garage it sees me, from the minute I step foot in my driveway or my yard the lights come on. When I installed it I went ahead and added a MicroSD card in to the top of the camera. It keeps a good history of all motions detected so if my Blue Iris on my home computer was to go down or miss it, it is also saved in the camera itself as well. You can view or download directly from the App, and you can even format the SD card from in the app. There is not a single thing I can think of this Flood Light Camera System can’t do. This is a Great Solution for both my lighting and my security needs!!","Let’s start from the box I was a little surprise since the box was larger than expected but it was well organized. Not sure why regular manuals are missing on recent cameras, doorbell products, maybe set up process has been simplified, I had no issue since I was familiar with the product but for new customer it might be an issue. This is my amcrest camera number 9 and so far i am very happy with the products, I'm just replacing old cameras with newest version. So far no issue but when there is one they will fix it very soon with a firmware update. This camera works with Alexa devices and Fire Tv. Motion detection works great very smart at level 3 and the light sensor is accurate and it turns on time when motion is triggered and when is dark. I can force control light from app and works great. App functionality works great on Smarthome and old app, I have some old cam and use the old app to have all together. Camera itself has a great look and overall product look great above my garage door and it didn’t look weird cam/light, very similar with RING Floodlight and I like this better. It feels good quality product, plastic for the camera and metal and very sturdy, it comes with the hook that will help you during installation process, I was very impressed. Floodlight/light is very strong good coverage you can tilt and adjust to many direction. And finally SD CARD option is the big win, why pay for subscription like on Ring or other brand, and thats why i switched to Amcrest since it gives you the option for SD card so you can save the footage on SD card. I have activated both motion detection and continues recording on 64GB and that will be good for 7-8 days recording HD. If you do just motion detection it will be more than a month with HD quality. Honestly I am very happy with this product and it will be a good sell.","I have switched all my cameras from Ring to Amcrest now, I normally use their 4k cameras but the 1080p one has done very well for me so far. The motion light has been great and even caught some skunks on camera the other night.Pros:• Single app for all my Amcrest cameras• The camera has local storage so if disconnected at least it still works.• Motion detection with the LED lights and they are super bright.• 2-way audio works great, was surprised to be honest because my previous camera (ring), while working, was never clear. Same internet and everything and none of the same issues with this one.• Works great with Blue Iris in case you don’t want the cloud offering, at least they aren’t forcing you to the cloud, unlike some others.• Installation was easy as I replaced an existing motion light with this.Cons• If you don’t know electrical, please have a licensed electrician install.• If you have had previous Amcrest cameras like the 4k, there is a new app for this and the doorbell.

One by one, two by two, I have been replacing the less expensive domes with these quality units. The camera housing and mounts are metal, so shielded from electro-magnetic interference, within reason. The IR illuminator LEDs are strong, but......""intelligent."" With bullet cameras, there is a ""beam"" of infrared energy which seems to be focused, thereby giving hot-spots. These cameras have not only a very wide focal angle, but the IR is not focused, but well dispersed: no hot-spots. Used with a quality monitor or HD tv, there is a world of difference between these units and most other consumer-related dome or bullet cameras: image definition. You will instantly recognize the difference in image quality. In addition, the IR photosensor which turns-on the IR, is not as sensitive as other cameras I've had.....I installed one of these ProHDs in our den, and the lighting has to really dim, to activate the IR. The result of this, is that the image is shown in color, and that coloration is truly spectacular and defined. In IR, the B & W image is crisp and clean. Don't waist your money on lower-priced cameras; invest in quality.","Great camera. Picture is good. It has great sound, can hear everything! I like the wide range it captures.

On a large commercial property this may not be an issue, but on smaller residential buildings this camera may stand out.Include speaker/microphone for two way communication","Amcrest PTZ POE outdoor camera is build like a tank. Very well constructed with metal double enclosure (for protection from heat of the sun I suppose) and sturdy and thick aluminum mount. This surveillance camera is a serious business with 32x optical zoom and motorized dome. You can control pan with full turn 360° angle and 90° tilt. Camera can move quickly or slowly and is completely silent all the time. It uses a very good motor for sure. Picture quality is stunning and you can see every smallest detail on your property in Ultra HD resolution. To connect camera you will need just Ethernet cable connected to POE+ switch. You also need to download the App and get the camera to your network. You can watch and control video on a phone, iPad, computer or NAS.It can be connected to NVR as well which I actually did. I connected the camera to my existing surveillance system Hikvision NVR via ONVIF protocol and it started working immediately. Even PTZ control works well from my NVR. Amazing compatibility. It also has paid cloud storage support or you can just record video or events to onboard microSD card. Camera has a nice web UI with lots of settings. You can program camera movement as you wish, there are many features and functions here. Night vision works pretty good and camera focus works well enough.Highly recommend product if you have large property.","I've been waiting on Amcrest to step up their game and offer a new high-end ptz cam. Here it is. 32x optical zoom plus you can turn on 16x digital zoom. The latter is kinda buried in a menu but it IS there. This cam is like having a several thousand dollar Axis camera as one of my Blue Iris cams. Yes, it connected up to B.I. easily with no hassle. Great night and day vision. I have not dealt with the AI yet so I can't comment on that aspect. The zoom/ptz interaction works like a high end cam should. When you're zoomed way into something, the ptz is still easy to manage. You can add a 256gb card into it if you wish. Going to buy a 2nd one of these and retire an existing Amcrest 18x older ptz to some other duty. Oh, another thing: It's quiet. Even when you are next to it (and I was for several hours installing it), it's silent, even when doing a ptz move. This feature may be very useful for some of you. I've seen a lot of noisy ptz cams. This one is not. I have not turned on the defog option yet, so I'm unsure if that introduces any fan noises or not.","This is a very solidly built POE Camera.The installation of this camera was a breeze. I already had the Amcrest View Pro installed (for my other camera from Amcrest). So installing this camera as an additional device was very simple. The fact that it works using POE made my installation very easy as I didn't have a power connection near the garage where I have installed this camera. But, since I already had an ethernet wire running there, I was just able to connect it to the existing ethernet wire and connect the other end to the POE Converter that I had bought earlier.This is a security camera that I have installed outside my garage in a spot that is kind of hidden so that no one can see the camera.The camera supports 256GB of memory. This will allow me to store a lot of recordings without having to delete occasionally.The zoom of this video is great. I was able to pan/zoom to see every minute detail of the person's face who was standing like 20 ft from the camera.The Camera price seems to be high. But, for the quality of this camera it might be worth it. I will know if I can use this to monitor any security intrusion at my house like the one I had earlier, when someone tried to break into my car parked outside the garage. But, we were not able to find out who it was as the face was hardly clear in the night mode with my existing security camera.Any integration with Alexa or similar services would be helpful.It is also nice that the camera can be broadcast live using RTSP so that it can be shared with anyone.The application also allows sharing the camera with other family members. That's a big plus. When I am out of home or do not have internet connectivity, my wife can monitor itOverall, I would give this a 4.7 out of 5 rating.","This camera is hands-down the best built camera I’ve ever personally used or tested. The quality of the materials is second to none. The camera is heavy as you would expect it to be due to the high end components. The starlight sensor in it is incredibly accurate and detailed in low light. The night vision reach that I’m able to get with it is quite incredible. It’s easily almost twice the distance that most other more consumer oriented cameras have. The PTZ motors and components are whisper quiet and fast. There are no weak, shaky or dead spots in the camera travel. I can set it to a position I need with incredible ease. The 32x optical zoom is also pretty fantastic and leaves nothing to be desired. It will go super far. I didn’t find myself feeling the need to turn on the additional 16x digital zoom. I also love that it has two sub streams in addition to the main stream. That is incredibly helpful in more complicated blue iris setups. The AI seems to be working well also. This camera is incredibly smart and fast. It isn’t held back by buggy firmware. It reacts quickly and smoothly. This camera is a great “eye in the sky” type of camera. I can get tag numbers and critical details reliably due to the excellent specifications of this camera. The included mounting hardware and cables are all excellent quality and instructions are concise and clear on how to get it all mounted and hooked up with ease. The multiple options for powering the camera are nice as well. Another welcome addition is the trip wire hookup. That isn’t something you typically see on the smaller, cheaper cameras. My only request would be that the camera have a small speaker and microphone built in for situations in which hooking up an external mic and speaker aren’t feasible. However, amcrest has many other options for these use-cases as well. I’m incredibly happy with amcrest as a company and this camera is nothing short of amazing.",10,7,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-Outdoor-Motorized-Security-IP4M-1083EW-AI/dp/B08TYZ5XFC/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=amcrest+security+camera&qid=1640230113&sr=8-15

Great Camera.,Great Camera. Very good investment.,It's ok. But then what camera is awesome?,Very good PoE Security Camera,"This 4K camera is a nice upgrade from the 1080p (2K) bullet camera I have, basically doubling the resolution I had making it easy to identify people walking down the sidewalk, watching package deliveries, and identifying makes of cars that drive by. For those starting out with their first camera, I recommend a minimum 1080p (2k), but definitely go to 4K like this camera if your budget allows.The night vision on this camera is better than the bullet camera this is replacing, illuminating edges of the video much better and more evenly. Like another has reported, I did notice that the IR light can create a light hue on the top of the video which is caused by the IR reflection from the dome. I found this reflection can be minimized by cleaning the dome and lowering the brightness of the RI light in the camera settings.The wide-angle lens on this camera allows me to put the camera under the corner eave at the house and cover my front door along with my entire front yard and driveway just like the bullet camera I have.This camera is expensive because you are paying a premium for the motorized optical zoom that can be adjusted remotely to zoom straight ahead. This dome camera does not have a motorized Pan/Tilt. The zoom is great if you need to keep an eye on something in the distance and you can't mount a camera closer to it. If you are mounting the camera near the area you are keeping an eye on, then it's not likely worth the premium.I have had good luck with wireless cameras, but I have a very busy wireless network and wanted to ensure there are no signal losses or bandwidth issues, especially with 4K, so POE is my preferred choice. Running a POE cable is just as easy as running a power cord from my perspective so I highly recommend POE cameras.This camera can record 15 frames per second (FPS) at 4K. Its not the best frame rate to capture fast moving objects, but you can go into to the configuration options and lower the resolution a little to get 25 FPS. I think the trade off is worth the extra FPS.Let me know if you found my ramblings helpful with a thumbs up. Best of luck in your surveillance project.","11/24/2018 Update - I've attached pictures of day and night view. Very Clear! I need to make one more adjustment to have the night vision lights closer to the back door - but this camera is great. One word of caution - Keep Palm, Hand, and Finger Prints OFF OF THE DOME GLASS. I had a very blurry night picture at first and could not figure out what was going on - and then I got some glass cleaner and cleaned the dome glass - and WALLA, clear as can be. This is a great camera - I have one suggestion for Amcrest - automatic pan/tilt functionality instead of manual.I had installed several Amcrest cameras before purchasing my first POE camera. and I must admit, it took me a couple of days to figure things out (largely my own fault as my power source was not connected), but once I got it - it was easy street going forward. Test the camera operation before you do any mounting to make sure you can get a picture. The picture quality is very CLEAR and the ZOOM IS OUTSTANDING- I could see the details of a rabbit in my yard. I will add pictures later. Installation was the most difficult - instead of buying a new POE switch, I connected a 5 port TP-Link 5 Port Fast Ethernet switch that I had sitting on my desk unused, to my existing DVR that I use to monitor/record CCD hardwired camera. Since I was replacing one of the CCD cameras, I was able to use the existing power connector and I already had an extra 100 ft Ethernet cable that I was able to run to the camera for POE.Worked great - and what a clear picture. Just installed today, so will update for night vision.A word of caution, it took me several go rounds to finally get the lens position to where I wanted it, I tried to do this before I mounted, but still needed adjustment afterwards. DON'T DISCARD THE DOME FASTENING TOOL - you will need it. The dome attaches very easily with the tool. So far I really like this camera. Will update after a few days! I plan to purchase another Amcrest POE. I am very happy with this camera!","I had decided to purchase this camera to replace the one overlooking my back yard and I made the right decision. The picture quality is outstanding. When I decided to install surveillance cameras around my house, I knew nothing about these systems, so after looking into it I purchased an Amcrest POE NVR as the center piece of the system. My consideration was based on making the things simpler without extra power supply wires and/or injectors and I made the right decision.Excellent quality camera, 4K (8MP) UltraHD, well-built and easy to install. The installation of this camera was a breeze. Basically, having the Amcrest NVR, using the ethernet CAT 5 or 6 cable, installation is plug and play. I own several Amcrest cameras, but this one stands out on picture quality offering a crisper image. Simple setup for motion detection when paired with Amcrest NVR. The IR LED night vision up to 164 feet gives you a very good picture quality, day and night. You can notice the 8-Megapixel progressive scanning CMOS image sensor at work. The wide viewing angle of 40°~110° allows you to capture every angle. An optical zoom of 10X, obviously would have been a plus. I am very happy with this camera! I would recommend it camera for image quality and features.","It is digital zoom so once you refresh the zoom resets back to 100%. Other than that excellent camera. The UI is same template as pretty much any camera out there so if you use Dahua or what have you you will see it is the same but maybe different color template. As for recording and capturing it is OK. Recording to FTP works OK. Recording to SD card works OK. Email is through YAHOO only as support for everyone else disappeared with no fix. That's ok if you have a few cameras but I have 100s of clients so that was very annoying. I'm not a fan of Amcrwst but instill use these for smart home install as the camera URL works reliably in web i terraces - until Amcrest mess that up with their ridiculous new smart home products. Walled garden worked for Apple as they had the volume, Amcrest doesn't have the volume and should keep it all OPEN.","This is my 5th camera from the brand. I trust them for the quality and ease of use.Ease of connectivity: Just open the Amcrest Pro app on the phone, add device and scan the QR code to set the new password. Once set, i logged into NVR and added by searching the camera into the system.Quality of video: Excellent day and night video quality. I can set the recording settings in the NVR.Overall: One of the best video cameras i have got and ever improving hardware.",52,17,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-Varifocal-8-Megapixel-3840x2160P-IP8M-2454EW/dp/B07GBGVN6T/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=amcrest+security+camera&qid=1640230113&sr=8-19

The 4K stream is pretty bandwidth and storage hungry, but H265 encoding shrinks that down pretty well — and the level of detail in the feed is pretty amazing. Easy to setup, loads of options and works seamlessly with Synology Surveillance Station. POE makes wiring pretty straightforward, although you will need a waterproof junction box if you are mounting this outdoors and running the cabling on (versus in) the wall. The Amcrest waterproof junction box is pricey, but it’s also the easiest to use and install, with a number of thoughtful details (although don’t use the waterproof connector housings that come with the camera inside the Amcrest box - they don’t fit, which is a bit foolish on Amcrest’s part.)A note on lenses - I have this version (2.8 mm) and the 4 mm version. The 2.8mm is great for close range surveillance where a very wide field of view is needed.... for many applications, I would recommend the 4mm version which captures a lot more detail past 20 feet distance.One last thing - check your Amazon cart carefully. There is an identical-looking but older version that does not do 30FPS at 4K. Not in itself an issue, but even the latest firmware on that older version is problematic using a Mac and Safari (or Chrome). The new 4K30FPS version has firmware that has those issues resolved.","I have tried many ip cameras from Hikvision, Trendnet, Reolink, Sunba and I am really enjoying my Amcrest cameras. This particular model is the Black Bullet 2.8mm 4K 161FT model. I purchased the Turret style 2.8mm but did not like them nearly as much. Also a great camera with audio and an sd card slot which I wish the Bullet had because the quality in my opinion is better.This camera comes in at an lens aperture of f1.6 which means it can let in a lot more light than the other cameras especially at night. What this means is less need for full noise reduction to achieve less grain in the picture. Another great feature is the angle of view. Surprisingly at the same angle of view as the Turret, the Bullet actually appears a slight bit wider. The Turret is a bit taller in vertical view but it is marginal especially if you don't need to look at the sky. I felt the Bullet was just a tad sharper than the Turret as well.The build quality is very nice on this unit. I like its form factor and relatively small size. I particularly like how easy it is to place the camera and be able to angle it without the wide distortions the Turret gives you if you are off center of the mount. Meaning you mounted it on an angle instead of straight ahead.Don;t hesitate on the 4mm version of this camera because in y opinion it is even sharper than the 2.8mm. I believe you are down to a horizontal view of 87 degrees I believe from 122, But if you don't need the wide angle or your subject you want to watch is farther away from the camera, the 4mm version is literally my favorite so far besides the wonder Amcrest 4mp 12x optical zoom PTZ camera. Buy a bullet, you wont regret it. By the way I paid for all my cameras with my own money, so not in bed with the company.Installation was a breeze and being used currently with Blue Iris. Motion detection features seem to be working well. I purchased Black because as my front security cams I actually want the to be seen from the street as a deterrent.","I love these cameras, the video quality is head and shoulders above my previous cams (IP8M-T2499EW), the video quality is just amazing, the low light capability is greatly improved, the smoothness of video is better than my 15fps 4k cameras and the 6mm option is great too, though not as zoomed in as I had imagined but I can't complain. The only downside (for me) and reason I haven't already bought a second pair is the lack of audio recording, I like having at least 1 set of cams with audio on the front side of my house, so I'll have to wait for a model that includes that to get a second pair there but might get a more zoomed out pair for back side of the house soon. For the price range, these are the best bang for your buck, you won't be disappointed!Pros:+ Improved visuals in low light, even in Color Mode+ Smoother video than any 15FPS I've seen+ Few more configuration options than older models+ All around crisper image than older models in this price range.Cons:- No Micro-SD card option- No Audio- Not as ""zoomed"" in as you might expect.I attached 2 images, of the same center-point, one is of my older 2.8mm model (IP8M-T2499EW) and the other is this 6MM model, its only a few second apart and I should point out, it's lightly snowing at the time as well as taken after 9pm at night, the newer camera just cuts-through the snow and shows a clear image where as the other one is grainy and you can see the snow falling in the darker areas. Both are in the same mode and settings. BLC enabled and Color mode. oh and in case you're wondering, the weather details at the bottom of videos are using a program called Blue Iris Tools along with the Blue Iris software.","These cameras are my favorite to use with BlueIris security systems that I build and install for customers. The image quality is hands down the best for the price you pay and without going into a professional brand series. The one thing they lacked over their older 15fps model was a SD slot that I wish they had but its not completely necessary for my installs. The night vision works pretty good but I almost always set the cameras up for color night vision as they don't need much light to keep the image bright enough at night to get the job done. The GUI on the cameras should you access them directly via IP address now load without flaw or needing to install extensions. This was a major plus for me as before models I despised having to use browser extensions that were slow and clunky.If your looking for a high quality, top end camera with features galore and great color night vision at a reasonable price look no further!","i bought this camera to replace a failed GW Security IP camera. My usage was simple, setup the camera on a fixed IP and point it to our NVR with no internet access. You do need a power supply or PoE switch as the unit does not come with a way to power it. I had no issues powering the camera with either my Unifi US-8-60W switch or my BV-Tech non managed POE switch. On my Unifi switch, it consumed ~5.5W of power, for reference.Initially setup the camera with internet access and made sure the firmware was up to date. Was blown away as to how easy it was to configure the camera using the web interface (my old cam needed a Windows app and IE Plugins) in Chrome.Had a ton of features which i decided to try before installing with our NVR like saving motion alerts to google drive which worked well. Had no issues connecting via ONVIF to either my Synology NAS or Dhaua NVRI ended up lowering the resolution to 5 MP to match my other cameras so when i viewed the live feed, they all looked the same and not to overload my NVR. Night vision is much clear and so is the view field.Great camera.",272,55,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-UltraHD-Weatherproof-3840x2160-IP8M-2597EB-28MM/dp/B0837485XG/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=amcrest+security+camera&qid=1640230113&sr=8-16

You can plug this camera on a POE network switch or buy a POE injector for a regular switch/router/access point to supply power, Video, and audio all over a single network cable.Access:I use the browser on my desktop to access settings. Still, you can also access this camera and setup page via local web interface over a browser, Amcrest View Pro app, Amcrest Surveillance pro, or Amcrest Cloud. The mobile app is straightforward to use, and it guides you step by step.Audio:The built-in mic is susceptible to picking up audio. I can hear the customers even outside the night window.Storage:I am currently using this camera with SDCard of 256GB with snapshots uploaded to local FTP onsite data sever, H265 compression helps keep the files 40% smaller and get more playback time. There are also other various storage options available that are handy when needed.Interface:Clean web UI and functionality, I must say more than my Lorex NVR.I am so impressed with the value received for the quality and price. I will look into, Standalone license plate capture camera (if they have one) as I am using my current lorex camera with openALPR but it is not doing a job at capturing license plates and smart home video doorbell, as the two doorbells I use at the hotel that customers have to press to receive service as my current ones keep dying every few months due to rough and frequent use by customers including direct sun heat they get 5 hrs a day.Love about this camera:This camera is capable of standalone operation. This means you do not need an NVR to make the camera work. It has a built-in NVR functionality. It can also detect motion, record video clips to a microSD card, send an email and push notifications, even upload to an FTP server.Lorex cameras cannot do any of this. Without an NVR or another device like NAS to store the video, there’s no point in buying one. Also, since they have ONVIF support, they should theoretically work with any ONVIF-compliant NVR.Overall:I would purchase a camera and would recommend anyone looking for excellent quality and functionality products for a valued price.",,"I bought this camera because it was inexpensive and I wanted to see how good it could be for the price. I was pleasantly surprised and have purchased three since my initial purchase.The picture is so much better than my old 1080p cameras. I am running my cameras at the second highest resolution (2688 x 1520) so I can get 30 frames per second (FPS). The highest resolution is 2592 x 1944, but only supports 20 fps. I can tolerate 25 fps at the lowest, but I am more than pleased with the resolution I am using. This camera also has something my older cameras do not, audio. The sound quality is not great, but the microphone seems pretty sensitive. It is more than sufficient to know if something is going on. Now I can hear if my dog is making noise when I'm not home.I also like this camera has H.265, which saves on storage space. I have not done a side by side comparison of recordings in H.265 and H.264 with this particular camera model, but I know H.265 videos can be much smaller than H.264.The camera's interface is quick and consistent with other Amcrest cameras. Nothing much to say about that.I use the surveillance program Blue Iris, so I cannot comment on the camera's built-in motion detection. For the Blue Iris users, this camera is quickly found via ONVIF. The sub stream is also quite decent, so be sure to use the sub stream with Blue Iris to save yourself some system resources when viewing all cameras via the GUI.If I had to find a criticism, I would pick the housing being made of plastic, however, this camera would cost more if they used machined aluminum. I don't mind the housing being plastic as long as it does not become brittle or turn yellowish over time. A possible issue for some people is that the camera can be removed quite easily by pressing down on a tab and sliding the camera. It will then come of the mount with no tool needed. You will not want this camera within in reach because it can be stolen, however, I recommend keeping cameras out of reach whenever possible. I don't mind how easy it is to removed the camera because that made it that much easier to install. All of my cameras are also out of reach. If I needed to mount a camera within reach of people, I would use a camera with a clear dome and one that cannot be easily removed.I used Dahua PFB203W Water-Proof Wall Mount Brackets with these cameras. They are a perfect fit and resolve awkward angles when mounting a dome camera on a wall. I also like that the cable from the camera with the ethernet jack can be housed within the wall mount. It looks clean and can reduce the risks of tampering or the elements. I put a bit of clear silicon along the top of the mount to reduce the chance of water getting in through the uneven surface of stucco. This mount makes it really easy to swap out cameras if you are using a similar Dahua mount. The two different models I had used the same bracket that attaches to the wall. This meant I simply loosened a single screw that secures the mount to the bracket, pulled off the mount, and unplugged the camera. Mounting the new camera was the same process, but in reverse.I have tried a coupe Dahua cameras because they were cheap (which I suspect are the OEM maker of Amcrest cameras or they buy from the same OEM). I was looking around and cannot find a similar Dahua with a lower price than this Amcrest camera. I also prefer Amcrest because they will likely issue a few firmware updates over the years. Neither of my Dahua cameras have firmware updates and one said it will never get one.I have purchased four of these cameras and will be purchasing at least one more in the immediate future. Any cameras that need replacing will be replaced with this model unless Amcrest comes out with something better for the price.","To start, this is a great camera that has all the features you'll need. I compared it side-by-side with another Amcrest camera that this one replaced (IP4M-1028EW-36MM). Both day and night, the picture quality is excellent. I was most impressed by how well the LEDs for the night vision worked. I'm used to my other cameras with 18 IR LEDs that create more of a spotlight effect, rather than a flood where it's very bright in the center, but then the light dims quickly the further you go out, they aren't the greatest at night. When this one only came with 2 LEDs, I thought it would be worse, quite the opposite though. This camera does an incredible job of night vision. The 2 LEDs provide more of a flood effect with no visible hotspots that uniformly light up the entire area (see pictures, there is a second light in the image, to light up the yard's furthest part). With a 2.8mm focal length, it does a great job of displaying the entire area. You can see a lot more at the top and bottom versus the 3.6mm but less on the sides. It's closer to a ""fish-eye"" kind of view. The audio is good if there is no wind, it will pick up the slightest breeze, but it does an excellent job of picking up the sound around it. The picture is excellent quality, but I did notice the video was a bit laggier than the 4mp cameras that I had. This camera would typically lag about 4-5 seconds, whereas the others were about 2 seconds (The settings can probably be adjusted to make that better though. I just used the default settings).I had this set up using an Amcrest NVR with PoE. The setup was simple, plugged it in, clicked remote devices, the camera was listed there, selected it and clicked add. That was it, I had it working in a few minutes. There are 2 things I am not a fan of with the housing. First, there is no way to tighten the camera once you have it in the place you want. The camera is stiff to move, but it would be nice to tighten it so it cannot move. The second is the ""quick connect"" mounting plate. You can take the camera off by pushing on a tab and pulling the camera out. No tools are needed to take the camera down. To install the camera, you screw a plate to the wall/ceiling and then slide the camera onto that plate. It makes installation quick and simple but makes removing the camera all that much easier. You can choose not to use the plate and attach the camera directly; however, the holes from the screws do not sit flush on the surface, so I was worried the plastic would crack because of the gap. I wish there were a way to screw/lock the tab so you would at least need some tool to remove it if desired.Besides those 2 minor things, this camera is excellent, and I would highly recommend getting it.Pros:Incredible night vision with only 2 leds (lights up the whole area evenly)Large up/down FOV (more of a fish eye view)Great quality videoCons:Any amount of wind will cause noise with the microphoneNot a fan of the housing","This camera is going to be the first of many for me. I have invested in a few different brands since purchasing our home about 3 years ago. Im an IT professional, so IP cameras have always interested me, but entry cost was a huge factor. I started with a Swann DVR system since I am no stranger to running cables. Cheapish entry point, built in recording, etc. Time goes on and they show their age fast, images get blurry/heavy artifacts as cables flex too much in the hot/cold cycle. The bundle of 8 cables leaving a makeshift security closet was ugly and unsustainable.When the camera arrived, it was very similar to professional ip cameras I have unboxed for work in the past. Solid casing, mounting template and mounting bracket, option for flush mount with cable out the side or through the backing wall. Ethernet connector has an assembly to make it weather resistant, with optional power-in port.I swapped it out in a spot where a Swann bullet camera had been, above our second story. This is not the ideal placement for a camera like this, as it would benefit at being down low to get the most out of its resolution, but i was looking for a wide angle to cover the entire south side of the house. 2.8mm viewing angles tend to do just that!Setup is as easy or complex as you want to make it. I didn't install a micro sd card inside the camera as i would be running video to my NAS. I plugged it in, opened the app, scanned the QR code on the cable, and I was already looking at my camera! I assigned it a manual IP since i have a dedicated IoT network to keep things segmented and logged into the camera via its web address. Built in console is complete and in depth. Changed my detection area settings, schedule, name, and logo placements on the image.The part that made this a for-sure for me was its ability to integrate. Alexa is nice and all, but this integrates natively with Synology Diskstation NAS's. I logged into Synology Surveillance Station and searched for new cameras. Within 5 seconds it populated the camera, and loaded everything it knew about the device. Swann cant do that. They don't even offer an RTSP protocol option, so I had to jump through hoops for days to get it to even see the Swann. They do not want you dealing with any other storage than their own NVR's. Amcrest software starts by asking if you want to save to SD card, maybe make your computer an NVR, send files to a network location or NAS. Why WOULDNT you want to use whatever you want?!Image quality is great, night vision is NEXT LEVEL. I turned off the IR for a bit and it still looked amazing. Mic is sensitive to the point that even from above the second floor, i could hear frogs in the nearby ditch. 20fps is silky smooth with natural movement even for fast cars going past. H.265 compression saves so much space over H.264 and is the most modern option to use.I have given my coax system a time limit to live, because one ethernet line to the garage fed into a PoE switch looks MUCH better than the 4 light duty coax cables there now. I still have the safety of my UPS backing up the cameras during an outage as one PoE switch on the backup will keep them powered up centrally.For the price, you cant go wrong dipping your toe into the IP cam waters with this camera. I sent a picture to an older coworker of mine, and within 10 mins of showing her, it was in her cart. You will not regret this camera.",1794,397,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-5-Megapixel-NightVision-Weatherproof-IP5M-T1179EW-28MM/dp/B083G9KT4C/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=amcrest+security+camera&qid=1640230113&sr=8-14

I use it with my Milestone system - the video quality is great and it offers some nice features. Ive found the performance on 2.4ghz wifi to adequate. Its not perfect but it works well enough.The camera does support ONVIF although I had some trouble getting it connected in Milestone at first. Oddly enough when I used the ""Address Range"" option to add it to Milestone it worked.The device has a Speaker and Mic that enables 2 way communication. This works in milestone but im having trouble talking from my phone on the mobile app into the camera. Still messing with that.The setup via App is easy. I used an ethernet connection and the P2P app to program it.I do wish the camera used a USB-C rather than Micro USB. Ive found I am able to run it off a portable battery for quite a bit. Useful for when I have a party and want to monitor who is in certain rooms.The little plastic adjustable screw mount that comes in the box is handy. I like that it uses the Universal standard Camera mount that you might find on a tripod.Im always happy with the affordability of these Amcrest cameras and the fact that the App does not require you to use a cloud service or sign into some account to setup the cameras. Configuration is very easy.","I've had a number of different styles of these cameras over the years. My first move into this format of camera was when I purchased a Foscam FI8918W 10 years ago as a baby monitor for my first born... These little cameras have come a long way! I love that this camera connects to power using a standard USB connection compared to the wall wart power adapters of my older cameras. It would have been a nice plus to have POE however for this price point there is probably a limit on just how much tech one can pack into this small package.As a pro user so I setup and use the camera with the Amcrest View Pro app. The instructions start with the camera on a wired network first before connecting it over Wifi. The setup and beginning configuration was super straightforward and easy to follow. This is my 7th Amcrest camera at my house and I have recommended them to many others in my extended family and friends. Hardly a tour of the View Pro app however two way audio worked great and the PTZ controls worked okay as well. The View Pro app made it very straightforward to review the footage or watch the camera live on my smartphone.The camera's web interface is similar to Amcrest's other offerings and I am pleased to see like other newer Amcrest cameras the image stream did not need any additional plugins or settings and displayed straight away. The web interface I felt was consistent and easy to use from the other cameras I have. I set up the camera to detect motion and record to the SD card internally using the web interface. It had no issues recognizing the 64gb micro SD card I grabbed off my shelf and put in it. For some reason I could not get the detection sensitivity graph to work correctly on my current release of Edge or Chrome and would also be nice if the PTZ function was slower when set to speed ""1"" even with a rapidly short click of a mouse the camera would move farther than I intended.For my use I also connected it to my Milestone DVR system. For some reason the Milestone camera wizard was unable to find the camera over my Wifi connection, however I found it on the first go through the wired connection... having the Milestone DVR software set the camera up through the wired connection and then updating the address to the correct IP address when connected through Wifi. I was able to test the microphone through Milestone and listen to audio from the camera, however I was not successful in getting the speaker to output sound on the camera or get the PTZ function working. I figure that's a configuration issue on my end. I do not recommend connecting the camera to a dedicated DVR over Wifi as it takes up a lot of bandwidth with either H264 or H265.I have had the camera now a couple weeks and my wife and I use it primarily to watch our fur-babies (cats) go around the house while we were away. It worked excellent and the IR night vision had no issues illuminating the space the camera was pointed at. I highly recommend these types of cameras over traditional ""baby monitor"" style devices available at big box stores costing well over $200 as these cameras are accessible while at home or out and about through your cellular data. As an IT professional recommend Amcrest cameras to people in my organization who ask for guidance for kid/pet cams where this camera succeeds, or other Amcrest offerings if something with a more security focus is needed.","This is my 4th Amcrest camera so I have been able to try out a few different models.Initially this is really easy to setup as long as you have the Amcrest Pro app on your phone. Connect the camera to your router/switch, open the app and under device manager select add device, then scan the QR code and follow the steps from there to add your wifi. After you add it to the wifi you can unplug from the router and you should be able to see it in the app.You have the option to mirror or flip the image so that if you mount it upside down on the ceiling you can still have the photo display correctly.There are a few new features on this camera I haven't used on previous ones that were interesting to try. The first is Auto Track where the camera will attempt to pan/tilt to track a person or object moving through the room. It works OK the few times I tested it, I'm not sure if I would leave it on as an everyday option.The other feature is Privacy mode in which the camera points directly down at it's base so that it won't see or record any video. This would be helpful if you have guests staying in your home and they don't want to be recorded.The Microphone and Speaker seem to work well, I don't generally use these on my other cameras.One thing to make note of is that this camera does not have an optical zoom, however the picture quality is excellent so using the digital zoom still produces a quality photo.Overall I am very pleased with this camera so far and don't expect any issues as the other cameras I have had for a few years and work great as well.",,"This is a great camera! with storage flexibility and motion trackingI love that it is not a closed system and you have the ability to choose your storage medium and have direct access to your video stream . I also have an Amcrest NVR and this connects seamlessly to it , to have all my recordings in the same box. Also has pan and tilt functionality, giving you more area to view.For the price and functionality I would highly recommendWhat I like1. Set -up/installation : Set up is easy and straightforward , I needed to add some additional length to the power as the one provided was not long enough for my needs.I have been pleasantly surprised with the wifi connection , ZERO dropouts to my NVR . I reused the hooks I had on a previous camera although one was provided2. Paring : After downloading the app, finding the camera is quite easy using either the search feature or using a fixed IP address which is recommended , plenty of guides for this depending on your router type.3. Motion detection : This is customizable for regions so you can eliminate areas that are not of interest . It also has motion tracking which works well , although it sometimes gets lost4. Quality : its 4MP with great picture quality, also had adjustable settings as needed. Night visions is also great, if you are extending the power source , do make sure to provide adequate power otherwise the IR will flicker5. Storage: You can use an SD card or connect rtsp stream to a dedicated NVR . Cloud backup are available, a lot of options which I love !6. IOT: If you are a DIY smart home integrator like I am , this will work great as the system gives lots of flexibility like RTSP/ONVIF , it also have an API for integration with other smart home products, what not to love!7. Smart home hub: integrates with smart home hubs , so you want easily view streams on that Alexa or google screenWhat I don't like1.

Blueiris is a wonderful software but very overwhelming to set up. This system is very simple. Plug and play. They simply just work straight out of the box.CAMERASThe bracket/mount for the camera is extremely easy to install. It's good for easy installation and bad since it is easy to detach if someone wants to steal but then I will have footage of the thief. I will take the easy install instead.I had to install sideway for 2 of the cameras due to my wire configuration. The image was rotated 180 degrees so they are correctly oriented. The only issue is the pics look stretch out when I make the fit to screen. Minor issue but I wish the screen just filled with black bar instead of stretched to fit especially in mobile app view.Night vision is great with infrared but since my house and front yard has decent light, I left the infrared light off. The night time images are way better than my old cameras I had.NVRFirst time when I hook up the NVR to my old TV that I was using before all I got was not supported error message. I had no idea what is not supported. After a quick Google search, I found that my TV has terribly low resolution that the NVR cannot display. After I swapped put the TV to a monitor, everything showed up great.Setting up the NVR was easy and straight forward. I was able to found all the cameras and able to add them, including my Amcrest doorbell even though the control/setting of the doorbell was very limited in NVR.I set up all the cameras setting and everything was working great. The problem I have was alarm set up. I set up to see the alarm message and they pop up but only stayed for a short time and went away. The message screen is still up but the actual messages disappeared. I don't see any other way to set them up so the alarm messages won't go away until I dismissed them.The motion detection detects every bit of pixel shifts of the scene. Since these cameras are not AI capable like Eufy, I understand why the every moments can cause the motion detection to go off. My cheap Wyze cameras are the same way but one thing I like is wyze will highlight the motion in green box to show what casued the camera to trigger. If Amcrest can implement something similar, that would be easy to track the reason of the motion alerts.When I turned on the face detection in the app, it turned on and saved the setting. But so far, I haven't noticed any face detection. I only see the normal motion detection. Snapshots are working great to glanced though the footage which is very helpful.These are my observations. I hope they are helpful.","Plugged everything in and powered it up. Immediately hit a snag where the region was set to Uzbekistan and English but both were greyed out and non-changeable. However I could change it via web browser, logged into the web admin where I could set region correctly.Checked NVR firmware which was up to date. Checked the cameras and they needed an update which was easy enough, hardest part was locating the camera firmware to download. I really liked that you could update all the cameras from one central place, that is a very nice feature.Setting up cameras in Blue Iris was surprisingly easy, just gave it the IP address and login info and it detected the first camera right away and gave me a picture. Subsequent cameras were also easy by cloning the settings for the first camera and editing. The cameras perform very well in Blue Iris.Cameras give a nice clear picture and seem well built. I thought at first the cameras didn't rotate on their base, but then discovered they do when I grasped and turned them. The way the camera attaches to the wall bracket seems firm enough, but I probably would have liked to see a screw to make theft of the cameras a little more difficult.The supplied cables have ends that didn't fit the waterproof coupler that comes with each camera. I was able to cut away the strain relief with a knife and the coupler then worked perfectly.The NVR has fairly comprehensive features, only thing I found missing was the ability to fast forward through sections of recording. The manual is rather lacking and there is no help built in. I didn't find it much of a problem, but if you haven't used some sort of camera system like this before it might be difficult.This was a massive upgrade from my old DVR system as the camera picture quality is really very good in daylight or night time.","I installed this product at my cousin's house, after he saw how responsive and clear the image is on my Blue Iris + Amcrest system was at home.We had to drill some holes in his walls to run CAT5e cabling from his bedroom to the living room, where we placed the NVR. We connected the NVR to his 75 inch 4K TV and it gives an impressive image!The image given over the included Amcrest View Pro software is crisp and fluid. The lighting situation on my cousin's porch is tricky; the porch light is always on and there is a Circle K located across the street with extremely bright lighting. I did not change any of the image settings such as exposure in the provided images, this is how it looks on auto mode, which is great.The cameras also include microphones which provide streaming audio to go with the video, so far I have not been in a situation where I would hear someone speaking; but I can very clearly hear the traffic in the street a good distance before I actually see the vehicle in view, so the microphone sensitivity must be pretty darn good.There is a bit of artifacting in the audio quality due to low bitrate, maybe Amcrest could raise the default value a hair.The app is very responsive when doing playback, after dragging the slider on the timeline, playback begins after 2-3 seconds. This is a fair bit more responsive than some other systems I have used.The most important thing to me is that Amcrest maintains full ONVIF compatibility, which means you can get as creative with your set up as you want. You can completely disable the P2P features and run the camera system on a separate, internal network with no internet connectivity, and set up your own NVR system using the software of your choice. This is important because the camera system you have mounted on your walls may exist longer than the company you purchased from!This is my third Amcrest-based system that I have installed in the past 2 years. This one using all Amcrest-provided hardware, the other 2 are a hybrid system using Blue Iris / Amcrest NVR / Amcrest Cameras. They are now my go-to recommendation for both work and at-home surveillance.","This is an excellent NVR and camera package. I actually had the standalone NVR (NV4108-HS) non-ethernet version of this and had a few cameras. So, I got this package and I have to say if you’re considering a non-ethernet version, this is the way to go. I have a full-stack Ubiquiti network, and for whatever reason, the cameras struggle to connect to my PoE switch. With this one – no issues whatsoever. You connect the cameras to the NVR and they just work. Also, the NVR came with the hard drive pre-installed. The last one I had to install a drive – very nice it was already installed.The NVR has (as far as I’m concerned) an easy-to-use and intuitive setup wizard to get it going. When you power on the NVR, it takes you through all the necessary steps to get it configured and set up (including adding the cameras). Then you’re ready to go. Mine shipped with the newer firmware, but if you have to update the firmware it’s not too hard. The user interface on these newer NVRs is so much better than the analog NVRs of the past which makes them an appealing option to many of the “subscription” based cameras such Nest, Arlo, Wyze, and many others. I like having my camera recordings stored locally and I like being able to use them without having to pay anyone.During the setup of the NVR, it guides you through a Peer-To-Peer setup of their Amcrest View PRO app which allows you to access your NVR remotely. Essentially Amcrest facilitates a secure connection between your device and the NVR with no subscription fees. The best part about this is that you don’t have to open any ports or anything in your router. The connection is automatic and transparent without any action on your part.The app does need some work but the notifications work well. They were right on par with my Nest Outdoor Cam and Wyze Cam and you tell the app what to when you tap on the notification. It allows you to select a few options two of which are opening to a live view of the camera or the recording event.The IP5M cameras are excellent! What makes them so excellent is their low-light performance. I really don’t like using IR if I don’t have to – you can see more detail without IR if you have enough ambient light. A great example of this is recently on my neighborhood Facebook page someone posted a video of someone trying to break into a car. The thieves pulled their car into their driveway and if they had IR turned off you might have been able to see the license plate, but because they had IR turned on the license plate just looked like a bright reflection. These IP5M cameras work well with low light and the picture almost rivals my Ubiquiti G4-PRO($449). The cameras have an excellent and high-quality microphone that can provide detailed audio once the “audio filter” has been disabled. The audio filter makes it sound like the microphone is underwater so I would strongly encourage doing that. You can disable the camera's microphone filter from the camera’s web interface.Speaking of the camera’s web interface. The camera's web interface CAN be accessed when they’re connected to the NVR. It may vary but you’ll use a URL similar to this http://<nvr-ip>:100. It’s the NVRs IP and then a port. You can see this if you use a browser to connect to the NVR and then select ‘Cameras’.Also, I would suggest changing the password again after you have finished the setup. I believe you change the password before adding the cameras. The cameras use a default login of admin/admin. If you change the NVR password after you have added the cameras it will update passwords on the cameras as well. The camera's web interface is accessible even if you’re not authenticated to the NVR.The NVR is fairly quiet and doesn’t run too warm as far as I can tell and with roughly 7 cameras connected with IR running it was using around 35 watts as measured with my kill-a-watt meter.Performance-wise – I would feel pretty confident that this NVR could record from six to seven 4K cameras running at their full FPS and resolution. I connected five IP5M cameras and two IP8M cameras all recording at their highest resolution and maximum FPS and set to record all the time and it was only using roughly 55Mbps out of 88Mbps of its available bandwidth. It doesn’t seem to struggle when recording but trying to playback the recordings you might be able to select 1-3 channels before it will say “Over decode ability”. I don’t really find that a problem as I’m only going to search one camera at a time. Also, a note about the matrix view of the NVR itself – it won’t play the 'main' stream from all the cameras. It will intelligently balance which stream it is showing in the matrix view – pretty smart.Playing back recordings is pretty easy – it’s easy to find motion events as the yellow blocks on the timeline. Downloading videos is tricky though – I would suggest using ‘SmartPSS’ and then watching a video on YouTube called “How to Playback and Export CCTV Video Using SmartPSS’ from ‘Auckland Security Cameras’. Also, be sure to read the ‘EXTRA NOTE:’ in the description.The method in the video works pretty well – as the video is very nice and clear if you can get the original video from the NVR itself.My favorite way to browse motion events is using the NVR itself (the web interface is decent from a Windows PC). The Amcrest App needs a lot of improvements before its usefulness will be on par with its competitors. If Amcrest nails their app down – this NVR with mobile app will be a game-changer.So, in summary: Great NVR, super simple to set up and configure, mobile motion notifications work great and built-in ethernet is life. Also, IP5M cameras are probably the best value in Amcrest’s lineup for quality and low-light performance!","I have several Amcrest cameras along with a few other brands as well. I’ve been using Blue Iris at home and an Amcrest NV4108-HS 4K 8CH NVR at a vacation home. I liked the simplicity of the NVR at our vacation home, and needed some more cameras at home and decided to add this NVR kit with 4 cameras. This kit does not disappoint. I already have a couple of the IP5M-T1179EW cameras, so I knew they had a great picture and good starlight performance at night especially considering the price point. Yes, there are better performing cameras with larger sensors for pro level night time performance, but they cost 2 to 3 times what these cameras do.Since I already owned the NVR at my vacation home, I mostly knew what to expect. One difference is that my other NVR did not include the POE ports. I honestly prefer that setup, as it allows me to run one cat5/6 cable to the back of the NVR and use static IP addresses that I setup on my router. The camera webgui’s are all easily accessed through a standard web browser. This version has the POE ports built in which does save on a POE switch or individual POE power supplies, but it gives you less flexibility on your camera placement. For example, you have to run all the cables back to the NVR from each camera vs just one cable from your router or a switch etc. You do still have the option of adding other cameras to the NVR through its LAN port vs the POE ports, so it does still give you the same flexibility if you want it. I just find the POE ports on the NVR as less convenient and redundant.That said, the POE ports can give you extra security as the NVR isolates them with a separate IP address format. My main router gives out addresses in the 192.168.1.xxx range, while the NVR addresses have their own IP range depending what you choose for example 10.1.1.128. The camera webgui’s are not readily accessible through a web browser as the IP address range is different from my routers range. You can access them if you log in to the NVR from a PC or mobile device and click on the link next to the camera. This will open the webgui of the individual camera. One caveat is to make sure the “Virtual Host” checkbox has been checked on the Network page of the NVR. It will allow you to resolve the address that is not in your routers range.One other note, I had no trouble accessing the cameras that were plugged into any of the POE ports other than Port 1. Amcrest uses an amended address, that of the NVR, plus a port number to access each camera. For example, in my Port 1, the camera was given an internal IP address of 10.1.1.128. When I click on the link to the cameras webgui within the NVR page, it directs me to 192.168.1.100:10080 for Port 1. (192.168.1.100 is my NVR IP as assigned by my router) The other ports follow with Port 2 as 192.168.1.100:10081, Port 3 as 192.168.1.100:10082 etc. The problem is that port 10080 has been deemed dangerous and has been blocked in most modern browsers, IE, Edge, Chrome etc. When you try to access the webgui of the camera in Port 1 of the POE ports, the browser will give you a blocked port error. There are ways to open up the port on various browsers, but it involves overriding the built-in behavior of the particular browser you are using. Just google unblock port 10080 for workarounds for your particular browser. Nevertheless, it is something that Amcrest should change with a firmware update that removes the use of that particular port. I haven’t seen any way to change the port range from within the NVR, so it’s something Amcrest has to address with a firmware update.If you are looking for top-of-the-line nighttime low light performance, you will have to pay a lot more and move up to cameras with larger sensors such as a 1/1.8” image sensor at 4mp or 1/1.2” at 8mp to get more low light capability at night. The sensor in the Amcrest IP5M-T1179EW cameras included with this NVR kit have 1/2.7” image sensor at 5mp. The more megapixels you cram onto a sensor reduces the low light sensitivity, unless you make the sensor larger to compensate for the extra pixels.Overall this system works well, and the cameras give a great mid-range consumer quality picture. Most users will be thrilled with the picture quality at day and night.",171,56,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-Security-Weatherproof-Pre-Installed-NV4108E-IP5M-T1179EW4-2TB/dp/B084NSYLRQ/ref=sr_1_38_sspa?keywords=amcrest+security+camera&qid=1640230117&sr=8-38-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFPTzVYNUJHV0tJMjQmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAzODczNTFGVzROMFRRMzVHMjkmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDg0MTA1OTJJODFUWkxRT05IU1omd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9idGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl

About 4 years ago it all started with 4 Hikvision HD dome-style systems and I have been happy with them. Slowly I've been swapping the Hikvision out with Amcrest HD PTZ dome cameras, which are great because they move. I also added the Amcrest doorbell camera, one of the only products I found which would *also* stream to Blue Iris, which was a hot button for me.I've been wanting to upgrade a few of the Hikvision to 4k .. really liking the Amcrest line up, I purchased this one. The 4k clarity is outstanding, and adapting to varied lighting is excellent. The night vision is far superior to the ageing HD products I had. What I really like too is Amcrests configuration tools, which run on my iPhone and also provide a very comprehensive web setup. No more do I have to dance around Internet Explorer ActiveX controls (ARGH). The Amcrest cameras use Chrome, which runs on both my PC and MacBook. Also the Amcrest doesn't require an overly complex configuration tool to be installed. Also, the iPhone app makes firmware upgrade extremely simple, like it *should* be :)The Hikvision dome cameras require periodic cleaning; those exposed more to the elements even more so. When the dome gets rain spots on them, the IR from inside the dome reflect back into the lens and can essentially make the camera useless till I get out the ladder and clean them up. This Amcrest is better design in that regard, where the IR is separated from the lens and I've not needed to clean it once, in comparison. Adjusting the camera position is much simpler too. Just loosen the lock screw and adjust. No more dangling dome cover.I've been very happy with this purchase, will buying a few more myself and recommend to my neighbors.","I have been involved in the security business for over twenty years on a commercial level and started when everything was analog, using coax cables to each camera and such. So, this gives you some background for my review.These are not commercial level cameras like Axis, Bosch, Honeywell and so on BUT for the price (especially when they go on sale) they are worth it.I have seen them used in commercial environments where cost was a huge factor ($100 compared to $1000 each and up.) but where HD, WDR and H.265 video compression is required these fit perfectly!I own several of these now and use them on my rental properties. I have a few in my primary residence and will replace my older ones with these POE cameras as they die.They have the same (if not better quality) than their competitors on the market like Dahua, etc. Everyone needs special features based upon their needs, so this statement isn't to start a comment war. :)The IR doesn't really go to 98ft but if you need to see that far, then buy an IR extender/panel. ANY camera needing that type of distance for nighttime vision you will need an IR extender/panel.The microphone works great but it's not two ways. I use it to pick up speech if someone is at an entrance and just standing there.The wide-angle lens with the WDR (Wide Dynamic Range) really makes it better for viewing. Think Axis low end camera quality without spending $700+ per camera.It streams one of the latest video codecs (make sure your NVR or storage device supports it) which has great compression and saves a ton of storage space.It comes with a SD card slot which is very helpful. If someone breaks in, most of the time they will look for your NVR or computer to grab that to remove evidence. Having a SD card gives you a backup at the camera level if they take your recording device or cut your Internet or Fiber before breaking in. Always go with the worst case Scenario!A few additional things to remember as well.FPS (Frames per second) and motion activation. If you are new to this, you might think that you need to have the camera recording full resolution and 24/7. That is never needed unless you are at a military base, airport, or other super high security facility.I highly recommend 7 frames per second for general use if you need 24/7 video capturing. Now there is a twist to this. You can capture 7FPS but when the camera senses motion it can trigger to capture at 30/60 FPS. This will give you 24/7 and full capturing of whatever comes into the camera view.I recommend interior cameras to be set at capture upon motion at full resolution and full FPS. There is no need to waste storage space on stairwells, hallways, nighttime only cameras or anything that you do not need to view/capture unless there is movement. You will save a ton of storage space.Always have the cameras (or NVR) grab screenshots and send them to you or a cloud storage device. Again, this will notify you and allow you to have a copy offsite if something happens onsite. Burglary, fire, etc.Use a storage calculator! I cannot tell you how many times I have seen where the storage space does not meet the client's needs. Then the storage device does not expand, and they must start over again. Figure out how many days you want to keep the recordings. Now remember, most new systems will send a copy to your Email or Cloud server when capturing events, so you do not always need the typical thirty days. you can get away with 7-10 days before it overwrites the information. This gives you plenty of time to make sure you have a backup, etc. Now commercial and government installations have legal requirements for storage and public records requirements so make sure you build the storage based upon your needs.ALWAYS ground each camera and ethernet cable to save the rest of your inline equipment. I say for all installations, not just for these cameras. Any surge or lightning strike will fry the device BUT properly ground will add a layer of protection for greatly reducing the factor of destroying everything connected to the switch and more. You can find dedicated inline devices for this.Remember though, the device needs power over ethernet (POE) so make sure you buy one of their power injectors or make sure your switch that you are plugging it into supports POE.For the price, features, water resistance, etc. I recommend this camera!","I tested this camera as a POE setup and a non-POE setup, the non-POE was powered by a 12v 2a Plug. For the POE I am using an Amcrest NV4108E-HS 4K 8CH POE NVR. I also tested this camera with Blue Iris 5 which is a 3rd party NVR software solution that I love. I am currently Running 8 Amcrest cameras 24/7 on both systems.This camera works well as a standalone camera as it does have an on board micro-sd slot, however I found the integration with both the Blue Iris software and the Amcrest NVR seamless. It really is another great Amcrest camera. I have been using it for a little over 3 weeks now and the only issue I’ve had is the Amcrest NVR kept saying the video for this camera could not be processed. I think my NVR wasn’t powerful enough for all 8 cameras even though the specs said it was. More research needed on my part. The image quality is superb, the night vision is where it shines in my opinion, this camera only has 2 IR LEDs yet it handled low light conditions better than all my other cameras did as seen in the uploaded picture the IP8M camera is the only camera out of the 3 that has not gone to night mode because it handles low light so much better than before. The one-way microphone is also a nice touch, you can even set up recording based on noise detection. I plan on using this camera to document the work on my 69 Chevelle and will post an update with more use.Amcrest products are great and customer service is fantastic. When you purchase this camera, you are investing in the product and a company that cares about you.","The IP8M-T2599EW-28MM is a very nice improvement upon other Amcrest 4K cameras that I have used and by far the best.BUILD QUALITYThe build quality on this camera is comparable to the other 4K Amcrest cameras that I have with its very solid metal construction.  The box does clearly come with everything you need to make sure that your camera is safely installed.  I really enjoy the new ""face"" of this camera.  I find the solid black field around the lens makes the camera stand out less.  It's always tough with cameras to not give the impression of overbearing surveillance, so this helps out. INTERFACEAs with other Amcrest cameras that I have used, this camera has the modern Amcrest interface. The preview mode allows for crisp and clear playback on what the camera is looking at.  There is a rich set of available features that are very easy to edit and you can also tune your video quality quite easily to help it match up to the environment it is in. The camera also has such a strong feature set that an NVR would not be required due to its built-in functionality.  It is also able to have different ""backoffice"" type settings for things like changing the name and many networking settings including Dynamic DNS.One thing I would like to see in the camera is if the interface could list out what model of camera this is.  As I get more cameras installed, it would help to have this by default without having to use the device name, watermark, or manual tracking.It would also be nice if the camera could use centralize user authentication instead of only local authentication on the device.VIDEOThe video quality on this camera makes a big step forward.  I'm not sure if it's just tuned better, but it's much crisper than my other 4K cameras. The daytime video is really great.AUDIOThe audio on this model is pretty good.  Seems to be less tinny and garbled than other ones I have used in side-by-side testing.POWERMy camera is powered by PoE. While in standalone live preview mode, I have noted that the camera draws between 2.3W and 3.2W.  Once again, this is the best that I have recorded with Amcrest.SUMMARYThis is the best Amcrest camera that I have used so far.  Really great to see how they keep developing their products.","This review is for AMCREST UHD 4K (8M) turrent outdoor POE camera (IP8M-T2599EW).(AMCREST offered 50% off for an honest review of this camera.)A very short review - if you are using 3rd party software to manage cameras (like Blue Iris or Synology Surveillance Station), no need to look further, this is no doubt one of the best outdoor cameras for you.More details:First of all I have been using AMCREST outdoor POE cameras for 3 years and I am generally very satisfied with their hardware. (Not so for their software, more on this later). I have 8 AMCREST POE outdoor cameras (IP4M-1026EB) setup around my house and I have never had any issue with any of them (knock knock wood...). So I have high expectation for this product too. While I haven't been using it for long (only 2 weeks), I can tell the construct is very very sturdy and solid, you don't see any plastic, all are metal and glass (for the camera) and the finish is elegant, it's a high end camera (unlike some other brand's outdoor camera, you get plastic stuff).Secondly, it's easier to install than most other bullet outdoor cameras because with the provided tool, the base and the camera can be totally separated, so you first install the metal base (as easy as a piece of cake), then you fix the camera onto the base. Whereas for bullet cameras, the base and the camera are one piece, the installation is less flexible.Thirdly, its features make it perfectly used with 3rd software: a) dual stream support - a sub stream (low resolution) can be chosen in viewing or storing, this greatly reduce bandwidth or storage depending on your configuration (Blue Iris and Synology both support substream) b) x265 support - again cut bandwidth usage or storage requirement almost in half c) aac audio support d) overlay is removable and configurable, so you get better control overlay drawing in 3rd softwareFourthly, like all other AMCREST cameras, it has a standard web interface to configure everything, from picture quality (BLC, WE, IR and Exposure) control to even customized https certificate, it covers every aspect, way better than some cameras that can only be configured in the app.Fifthly, the day-light picture quality improvement over my previous generation (4M pixels) is easy to identify, however, I don't see a huge night-time picture quality improvement.Sixth, the motion detection feature is largely the same as my IP4M-1026EB, I was hoping they can bring in ""human-detection"" or ""boundary-cross-detection"". (It would be a killer-feature to be able to do human-detection without the need to go cloud.)Other things worth mention: there is an option to turn off P2P (default is on), P2P is regarded as unsafe sdcard is supported, I didn't test it.Lastly, the mobile app is about average, I am not saying it's not good, it is not just as good as the hardware level. I personally install AMCREST App on my camera for live view and manage them using BlueIris for video recording (right, they can stream to multiple destinations at the same time) thus get the best from both worlds...I highly recommend this camera",91,47,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-3840x2160-NightVision-Weatherproof-IP8M-T2599EW/dp/B08FCRPD1C/ref=sr_1_48?keywords=amcrest+security+camera&qid=1640230123&sr=8-48

This is not a dedicated license plate camera, however, it does a great job reading license plates during the day. I am still working on and tuning the settings at night, but I am currently able to ready every single plate during the day at a distance when I estimate to be around 70-80 feet. The setup of the camera is straightforward but the Amcrest Cloud App on IOS is missing a lot of features, so my go-to is the web interface that is hosted by the camera which is the same as all the other Amcrest models. This camera supports face detection, smart motion for humans and vehicles, IVS, and all the default triggers. I currently have mine set up where it catches traffic and not a lot of people walking, but it has been able to catch all cars driving by. This camera also supports local SD card storage which I use on all my cameras as a backup. All in all, it's a great camera and I'll be keeping it in my arsenal of security monitoring.","I've been using the Amcrest 4k optical zoom camera for the last couple of weeks. The motion detection can detect whether it is a person or car which seemed to work pretty well. I mostly am just interested in people coming up to our door and that seemed to work well. Cars that speed by may or may not get picked up as a car. I had some initial issues installing the camera using the Amcrest ViewPro iPhone app. The app would crash when I tried installing it as a P2P device and scanning the QR code. I eventually got it added and the camera worked great. The optics are pretty nice, with the exception of the focus feature. When I changed the focus a small amount the picture was so out of focus it wasn't recognizable. I can press the AutoFocus button to get it back though.Overall I'm pretty happy with the camera though, being able to optically zoom with a bullet camera is pretty nice as well as being able to distinguish between people and cars with the motion detection.","This camera surprised me with the quality of the video. I have purchased a few cameras that boasted ""great video"" however they left me wanting. The video was crisp and clear. Night vision is better than I expected. Positive side effect is being able to clearly identify wildlife at night. Setup was a breeze. Like any camera there is a lot of tweaking to get the configuration that you are specifically looking for, but make no mistake this camera affords you the ability to configure exactly to your liking. I will be purchasing more Amcrest cameras in the future.","Purchased as an upgrade from an older bullet camera and overall I am pleased with the camera. I enjoy that I can now browse into the camera without special plugins. Works nicely with BlueIris. Also, appreciate the improved camera performance at night, it doesn't perform magic, but clearly better than my older camera. If you are using the BlueIris AI for alert confirmations then you don't need the AI features of this model.","This is a very nicely build Amcrest 4K Optical Zoom POE bullet Camera. Aluminum base and wall mount are quite heavy and overall construction seems to be built very well and easy to adjust. Camera also has adjustable sun shade made of plastic. Optical zoom is rather unique feature in bullet form factor and you will hardly find such cameras on the market. So you can control motorized 5x optical zoom at stunning 3840x2160 4K resolution with auto or manual focus. This is not a WiFi camera and to connect it you will need Ethernet cable connected to POE switch or NVR or you can use your external 12V power adapter. Video quality is outstanding and you can see detailed picture from min to max zoom. I connected it to my Hikvision NVR via ONVIF protocol and camera started working immediately after entering login and password. I chose 1080p resolution at 30 fps but camera supports up to 3840x2160 at 20 fps. Traditionally for Amcrest this camera has a nice web UI with tons of features and settings such as intelligent video surveillance. You can record and control video on your smartphone, tablet, computer or NAS. Camera also has paid cloud storage compatibility or you can record video just to onboard microSD card and play it back via smartphone app or web UI. Night vision works pretty good and camera focus works well enough in night mode.Improvements. To me personally it would be nice to get an automatic zoom control function with schedule. I need to zoom in on my driveway every night and zoom out every morning after.Anyway this is highly recommend product.",6,5,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-Varifocal-2-7mm-13-5mm-Weatherproof-IP8M-VB2896EW-AI/dp/B097J5GY22/ref=sr_1_46?keywords=amcrest+security+camera&qid=1640230123&sr=8-46

Great camera.,A fantastic camera at a good price point,Great camera at a good price,Great camera for the price,"This is my 4th Amcrest camera. My 1st camera is getting close to 2 years old and still going strong. Basic functions and the phone app are pretty much self explanatory. I personally have had trouble working out things like motion detection and recording schedules. Usually I just call customer service to straighten it all out (which takes about 10 or so minutes and then you usually are on your way). With my new camera I decided to play around with the app and the online functions some more. After doing some reading (yes... I actually read the online user manual. Who would have thought! Right?) I was able to set up my motion detection and schedules. I have used them to monitor my young kids from another room or to keep an eye on my house while I'm away. It's even helped me solve a few mysteries as to what my dog is up to in the middle of the night or while I'm at work... those video's are keepers for sure. They do their job! I've been incredibly happy with these cameras and I love that I'm not forced to save video's to a cloud (although it is an option). I just insert a 64GB chip in each camera and that has worked out well so far for me. I have a few friends who are such fans that they have even purchased these for their homes as well. The 2-way audio is very helpful. I prefer not to put camera's in bedrooms, but I do have one outside my kids rooms so that I can make sure they are up and going in the morning. If someone decides to sleep in I just use the 2-way audio to get them moving. I also have a camera I keep loose so that I can move it wherever I need it. Currently it is placed in a window facing outside (I had to turn the night vision off since it just reflects in the window) so that I can monitor my backyard for a project we're working on. I'm hoping I can use the recordings to make some kind of time lapse video of our progress! These cameras are a heaven sent for us. Both fun and functional.*I purchased my first 3 cameras and 4th camera was provided by Amcrest for testing and an honest review. I would not hesitate to buy more cameras in the future from Amcrest and I'm liking the idea of a few outdoor cameras.","This is the second camera I do buy from Amcrest. I really love the product. I love the quality of the video/image. It has lot of capabilities that allows to navigate in different directions without the need of having to enter in a complicated configuration process. Just need to connect the camera to the router (for configuration only), plug the power adapter and after that, it just takes less than a minute to have it ready to using.So far, it works great at night and day. It switches mode automatically and the quality at night is good enough. one of my two cameras is installed in front of my house and the other one is in the garage.The size of the camera is just fine. No to big so it can be seen for people and not to small so it can't capture few things.The option of pan and tilt is just great and it does not affect image quality. Of course, how well you see the image when you are remotely, it depends of the internet connection speed you have at home or the place you have the camera installed and your mobile device connection.For sure I give 5 starts to this camera. There are two things I would improve on it:1: the slot for adding the micro SD card. For people like me with big fingers, it is hard to insert/remove the card into/from the slot.2: The lens aperture and wide angle. In some way, these two things really limit how you see the image and how many things you can see during a camera capture.Finally, I got to say that it is an amazing product for the price. It is worth the expense.I am attaching a couple of pictures. I do apologize in ahead for the mess you see in the garage pic, but that was the only way to show the audience how well it works.","This is a really nice camera, that is very easy to set up and use. The build quality is great and the image quality is exactly what I was expecting. The PTZ function is super fast (almost too fast if there is network latency). I set this camera up to use both wired and WiFi connections. This allows me to simply plug in the camera in any room I want to monitor and it is up and running in seconds. I use Blue Iris for my security system and this integrated in easily. I have also tried it with the Amcrest App which works well also.One of the reasons I chose Amcrest is they allow the most flexible ways to use their cameras. If you want a super easy setup, that's an option. If you have a more advanced network there is plenty of advanced options to allow you to set it up however you need it. They offer a cloud service but don't force you to use it. When some companies require you to have an account with them or go through their servers, Amcrest does not force you into that. If you know how to configure your network you can use their products without having any external accounts.","I've been using Amcrest cameras for many years and have always been pleased. This camera is no exception. All of the features function as they should. The pan and tilt seems more responsive than on older models which I own and the video quality is superior. As well as the Amcrest phone app, I was pleased to find that it is compatible with Blue Iris software and Amcrest Surveillance Pro both of which make the camera controllable from your PC. It comes with a mounting bracket which allows for positioning in most any situation and attaches via a thumbscrew to a standard 1/4-20 threaded fitting. The fitting allows it to be mounted on a standard camera tripod as well. Amcrest also has a toll free number so you can actually speak to someone if you require any assistance.","Great camera, great price. It's very clear, the zoom is great, along with pan and tilt. The only problem I'm having is I can't keep the time set correctly. It's constantly changing the time. Very frustrating, and looking up events I have to see what random time zone they put my camera on so I can properly look up the events. If I can finally solve that problem, I'll be thrilled and this camera will be a 5 star for sure. I use their cloud service, that way i know everything is being recorded, no headaches for me. It's $20 per camera for 30 days continuous recording. They also have less days /less money plans or better deals when buy at 90 days for $35.99. I'll definitely go to that plan if I can get the date issue I'm having solved finally. There is also a motion recording plan, cheaper than the constan recording. The camera is well built, comes with great mounting piece, with screws too. Includes the power cord via USB cord and plug. Also includes an ethernet cord. Mine is set for wifi, and it was simple to set up and stays connected with no issues whatsoever. I highly recommend this camera.",433,110,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-1920TVL-Security-Wireless-IP2M-841B/dp/B07NDM993X/ref=sr_1_47?keywords=amcrest+security+camera&qid=1640230123&sr=8-47

Night-Vision), reliable & seems VERY sturdy.",A decent camera,Great Wi-Fi camera and awesome price for all the features it comes with.,"Great price/value ratio.Hello dear readers,Here is my review about this camera.I got this camera for inside of my garage, since the garage door sometimes doesn't close. I also have an amazon key service, and delivery guys don't close the door sometimes.As a fan of Amcrest products I didn't look for any other camera but Amcrest. And this one didn't disappoint me too. The quality is as always very high. Camera's body is made of plastic, but I would say is some sort of ABS hard plastic. Same with the mounting bracket. The good thing about Amcrest cameras they have a MicroSD card slot on board, so even if you are not planning to get a cloud subscription or if you don't have external NVR to record the footage, you can simply plug in for example 64gb memory card (can get here on amazon for $10) and set up an event recording or scheduled recording or even continuous 24 hours recording. By the way, I was able to connect the camera to my Synology NAS for 24/7 continuous recording.The camera has both wi-fi and hardwired ethernet connection options. So if you have a bad wi-fi signal or you just want to be on the safe side and worry about wi-fi signal interception, you can turn wi-fi connection off and use ethernet cable.Overall happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend to my friends.","Hope this answers some questions about this camera.1.You need to download the Amcrest Home App to your phone to set this Camera up. Mine could not be accessed by Amcrest Surveillance Pro for the initial setup on my wireless network.. The Home app makes it really easy to do it.2. Once that is done, you do not need that app any more. Surveillance pro and Live View both can be used to tweak this camera to your liking. All settings are available (Video/Audio/Network/Motion -everything you need to set this up the way you want to use it. Yes, including setting a static IP. Yes, this does get an IP address, hence it is an IP camera. No, it does not have a web-page login like most IP cameras for tweaking, but once it's on the network, it's not needed anyhow...Surveillance Pro/Live view will access that for you.3. Daytime picture quality is awesome with the perfect coverage for my needs-101 FOV @ 2.8 lens fit the bill. Night vision is good for this price range, but not fantastic. Starlight is a great addition to these cameras.4.Surveillance Pro (If that is your poison) has a serious learning curve. It takes sometime to understand all the settings and what they do. But once you get it down, it works perfectly as does the Live View phone app.I have finely gotten away from all the mix of odd-ball cameras using iSpy and decided on Amcrest (Re-badged Dauha's-which are very good cameras) . I am very pleased with the quality of these cameras in all areas. Highly recommended for the average residential use!Update:9-23-2021Camera is still performing like the day I got it. No issues. Yes, a wireless camera may disconnect every once in awhile (In my case rarely, router placement is critical). Just simply unplug the power from the wall- wait a few seconds and then plug it back in. It will reconnect with all of it's original settings.I see where some folks gripe about the motion detection..that's a software issue, not the camera. This camera does not have built in motion detection. I found an awesome software for accurate motion on Amazon if you are interested, AI-Homeguard. It's AI driven and eliminates 99% of the motion detection issues.","I am beyond happy with my Amcrest Outdoor security camera!This is my third Amcrest camera (I also have 4MP UltraHD Indoor WiFi Camera with PTZ & 4K USB Webcam).From my experience with these two other products, I knew Amcrest was a great brand and my expectations were fairly high.Well the outdoor security camera didn’t disappoint!Like all Amcrest products I’ve used, setup is easy and the camera itself is extremely reliable with some great features.I have a home automation platform running on a Raspberry-Pi and Amcrest is one of the easiest brands to integrate with it, so I can have all my camera feeds in one place! The night vision is fantastic, really good quality. One of the most important features for me is Motion Detection. I depend on it a lot, to notify me for movement in certain places depending on things like If I’m home or not. Just like my Indoor PTZ camera, motion detection on this is great.This camera also got me to use the “Amcrest Smart Home” app for the first time (Previously I’ve used “Amcrest View Pro”). I could still add the camera in Amcrest View Pro (though didn’t check if this was supported) but the instructions say to use Amcrest Smart Home; I have to say.. the Amcrest Smart Home app is actually fantastic. Much more intuitive and modern! (Although I’m still using Amcrest View Pro as well as it now has both my cameras added)On top of reliability and great functionality, the camera itself is very aesthetically pleasing. Looks like nice and modern, definitely more compact than similar cameras from other brands and it feels very sturdy. It has yet to get a hit off anything or have to put up with much stress, but the material feels really really strong.POE is also a massive benefit for an outdoor camera like this one, really happy with that.TLDR:Amcrest products are just fantastic. Great feature-set, really reliable & I’ve always had amazing experiences with their support when I’ve had questions.I’d recommend Amcrest and this camera in particular to anybody!","Testing Period for review: 11/17/2020-11/30/2020The camera came in nice, solid packaging, and was undamaged upon arrival. The instructions were easy enough to follow to run the initial set-up and connection to the Amcrest Smarthome app.The first few days I had it connected via wifi to test the connection. While connected to the same wifi, the camera had a clear picture, made better by activating the HD quality streaming. The sound coming from the camera was clear. I did format and install a micro SD card for storage as well as sign up for the free trial of the could recording. I do like the motion detection in the app, and the ability to select zones within the app to alert for motion detection.The physical design of the camera was nice and sleek, though I do wish I was able to get the black one since I believe that it would have blended in better. Otherwise, I had no complaints about the physical design of the camera.After a while, and some connection issues, which I will address later, I connected the camera to ethernet. The process was pretty easy, although I wish it would not need a reset on the camera in order for it to connect successfully to a harlined connection.Now the downsides.While connected to the wifi and hardlined to my internet, I had trouble connecting to the camera when I was not on the same network as the camera. When it was hardlined, it seemed to do much better, there were still issues getting the stream to show up though the app.Another nitpick is the the SD slot should not be so close to the rest button because, if you have meaty man fingers like me, you will more likely than not press the button while inserting the SD card.Overall:The connection issues I had are a major turnoff to me. While the connection is much better if on ethernet, it should work well on wifi since it is advertised as a wifi camera. BUT, the quality of the video, the wide angle that it provides, the ability to listen in, and the night vision work well in this camera's favor. I don't know if I would recommend this camera to a friend until the app connection streaming issues are fixed, but overall I am happy with the product. As I sit here, the app is streaming HD video to my phone through the smarthome app, but only if I am not connected to my workplace wifi. I will say that I would pay around $50 for this product, and maybe $65 IF the app connection issues were fixed.","The Amcrest SmartHome 4MP Outdoor Wi-Fi Camera Bullet is perfect for someone who wants an easy and quick setup. After ordering the camera on Amazon, I got it in less than 2 days. The camera arrived in its original box and not inside an Amazon box, but it was well packed and everything inside was intact. The box included the bullet style camera, the power cord, CAT5 cable, mounting screws, camera installation paper template and a weatherproof housing for the CAT5 connection.This camera was very simple to setup and I did not need to read any instructions. Before I started the camera, I opened the latch behind the unit so I could insert my SD card (there is no SD card included so make sure to buy one when ordering the camera). I inserted my 128 GB SD card and closed the latch. When closing the latch, I noticed a rubber gasket to seal the SD card and all the internal components from water. This is an outdoor camera so that is comforting knowing it is made well and not just a marketing gimmick. After plugging in the power cord, I waited until the little light on the front lens was blinking green. I already had the Amcrest Smart Home app from my other device so all I had to do was add the device using the QR code on the camera and enter my password.After testing the camera inside, I installed the camera on my porch using the screws it came with. Make sure you use the template that comes inside the box. This makes installing the camera onto any surface a breeze. The power cord is approximately 9 to 10 feet long so if you plan on installing the camera outside of 9 to 10 feet to the nearest outlet, make sure to get an extension cable. I purposely installed the camera near an outlet so that I would not need an extension cable.The camera is competitively priced, and it has great features. I like the fact it is 4MP because it allows me to see everything clearly without a blur. I was not accustomed to the 30 FPS with my previous camera and this is important to have because it makes the video very smooth without lag. Even at night I was able to see my porch clearly using the infrared lights. The 101 ° viewing angle is something I have not had before with my previous camera. Now I can see 100% of my yard and do not have to pick which side of the porch I wish to see. The SmartHome App is filled with many features such as motion detection zones and more.

I needed POE cameras so I could avoid WiFi and having to put power near the camera. These have a great picture! 4K is the highest and these are only the standard HD but they make up for it with a mechanical zoom lens as well as mechanical focus. 360 degree movement and full tilt makes them even more versatile than the standard PTZ. I couldn't be happier with this camera and I've tried many. It's also vandal resistant and weatherproof - sorry I can't contribute much on those features as mine are inside and out of reach. The free software for iPad/iPhone works very well and Amcrest also makes a free version for PC that is easy to use and reliable. I'm also using these cameras with BenSoft SecuritySpy NVR with the standard ONVIF RTSP profile so no worries about compatibility.,"I've tried a lot of cameras from early D-link (my favorite is the DCS-5222L but it is discontinued) to some off the great wall junk and these Amcrest cameras are a very good value. I don't use the vendors SW, didn't use D-link either, I use Blue Iris and it works great. I am not a professional and don't expect professional results at this price point, but do expect responsive PTZ, good auto focus and satisfactory imagery. I prefer 1080P since it gives all the detail I need and uses less storage space, this unit delivers excellent results day and night.","This is the best lower-cost PTZ outdoor camera I've ever owned. Great field of vision. Decent night vision with help from small amount of light from nearby floodlight. Motion detection is good if a bit too sensitive at times (still working on finding the right adjustment). Also, I'm using the Amcrest cloud service, which works well with this camera.","This is my 2nd PTZ camera from Amcrest. The bigger and more expensive model is no doubt better, but this camera delivers great pictures, and easily pans and zooms. One caveat... I mounted it on a vertical surface, so the pan and tilt actions are not as intuitive. It’s really designed to be ceiling mounted.","This camera replaces an older dome POE camera. The PTZ function is a welcome addition. Day and night picture quality is very good. I use BlueIris to control my cameras and have had no issues adding this camera to my existing setup. I like the small form factor of this camera, you know it's there, but it does not stick out.",93,17,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-Outdoor-Vandal-Proof-Weatherproof-IP2M-866EW/dp/B08466W9CD/ref=sr_1_44?keywords=amcrest+security+camera&qid=1640230123&sr=8-44

To be honest there are many many systems out there that offer pretty much same features and functions just with different brands.. I was like pretty much overwhelmed by the market. I just came across this one while I was searching one day..and then I just decided to pick this one because:1. I do like its design and the color. ( I guess there are many white ones out there, but for some reasons, it just popped out on me.). These cameras look solid from the pictures, and I was hoping that they are not made by cheap plastic.2. This system is not that expansive compared to other ones.3. It is wired system. Personally, I do not like wireless counterparts because I know they can be hacked..and I have seen that on the news..4. The 1TB storage main unit is a plus for me as well.According to the description, it offers many features such as night visions and motion detections...etc..I personally do not care about all these fancy features as long as they can work reliably.After received it, I installed them by myself (I have to say that these cameras are built with great quality). It is my first surveillance system that installed myself. I would say it does require some work especailly for mounting them on the wall and running wires. But the connections and operations are pretty easy, and please go through the mannual if you are going to do it yourself..It is working great now as you can see in the picture..I do not really pay attention to all other fancy features, but it does have geat night vision. I would say this is great system with all basic funtions you need for a surveillance camera system. Will update more once I have all features explored.","I installed this system as an upgrade to my old analog camera system. This system was very easy to install since I already had the cables in place from my old system. Running new these lines as a new install would have been pretty easy if I did not have them in place. Connecting the cameras were very easy plug and play. The only down side i saw to the cameras were the lack of mobility (being able to rotate and adjust them into an exact position that I needed) However i still was able to move them. The DVR was super easy to install and setup. The install wizard walked you through the easy steps. The picture from these cameras are crystal clear in both daylight and at night. I left two of my old 720tlr connected and they were compatible with this dvd( However the New Cameras did not work on my old system) The comparison is unbelievable. These new camera have a very vivid picture in the day time. The night vision is awesome on these cameras. They produce a very clear black and white picture even giving detail to the face where my old cameras whited our the face. ( We had some one break into one of my work cars., with the old system you can see the person, etc.. However when you went to zoom into his face, we were unable to make out his face.) With these new cameras, you get an even clearer picture at night that give awesome definition in low to no light. The app on my phone is super easy to use and it is so user friendly. If you follow the steps in the manual you will get online (provided you have internet access ) with ease. For the price, this system is a must have. I am going to be buying two additional systems to install in my mother and inlaws house. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SYSTEM! I have a video however i am not able to upload it, as soon as I figure it out, I will upload it.",I'm a small solely owned security business which installs security systems and I've installed a variety of systems. This has definitely been a great surprise and will be using this system from here on out. Night vision is excellent also. I've added some screenshots from an install using my phone remote app. Another great feature is the ability to playback video from your phone remotely! You will be extremely happy with this system!Now if there was a way to add my business logo at the startup it would be perfect!,"Great DVR system kit, the installation was straight forward and relatively going smooth. The clarity is exactly what we needed, very reasonable price, so easy to install, the playback is great as well. Additional for that it works with any kind of old analog or AHD cameras, plus it supports an IP camera as well... Customer Support was really good as I had an issue with adding an IP camera and they resolved so quick…system included everything you need, would recommend to friends and family.","Received this set a couple of days ago, and I am impressed. It contains everything you need to get a simple surveillance system going.To set things up, I hooked the DVR to a HDMI monitor, turned on the system and it boots right up. The OS is a little clunky, but considering I won't be using that, I can see past that.I set up a couple of camera's, changed some of the camera settings and made sure the web-interface was enabled.I installed the camera's in my garage, installation is simple, just a couple of screws and the cable just plugs in.I then hooked things into the rest of my Blue Iris surveillance system, which was rather simple.The quality of the camera's is good. The pictures attached show the image in complete dark and very bright light.All in all, great set for the price. I have several POE camera's that cost more each than this set of 4 + the DVR. The image quality of those POE camera's is much better, but for a simple application, or as a start set. Nothing beats the ease of use of this set.",910,205,https://www.amazon.com/ANNKE-Surveillance-Security-Full-HD-Snapshot/dp/B07FDYLQMQ/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=annke+security+camera&qid=1640230055&sr=8-19

Many viewing options. Lots of features for a reasonable price!,I bought this system to replace my old wireless system. My old system kept losing connection to the wifi making them useless. I decided to start over and buy this system so I can hard wire everything so it will always record properly. The first step was deciding where I wanted to keep the DVR. After deciding it's location then I had to decide a general location for each camera and plan a path for the wires. I bought wire clips and used the to keep the wire attached to the wall of my house. Everything was essentially plug and play after running the wires. The wizard walks you through all the settings when turning it on and all the cameras are immediately ready to view without changing any settings. After the wizard there are more detailed menu where you can configure the motion detection and a bunch of other settings. The motion detection menu allows selecting the specific areas to detect and also a privacy mask option. The cameras are super clear during the day and night with the night vision. License plates are easily read with this system. The hard drive came preinstalled. After setting up the DVR I downloaded and setup the app for remote viewing. I used the app while positioning the cameras so I can see the exact view when mounting it. These mounts were harder to adjust compared to my old camera ball mounts. There have 2 different screws to adjust the position. I really like how quickly the cameras load on my phone when viewing the cameras remotely. The DVR comes with a remote and a mouse so it's easy to navigate it's menus. I can now comfortably allow my kids to play in the yard as I can watch them from inside my house while working or cooking dinner. I recommend this system for anyone who is willing to put the extra effort to run cables but then have a rock solid system that's easy to operate and is very reliable.,I have been searching for nice security system for business for a while. The biggest factor were a system that has high definition video while recording. My previous one was only 720p solution. Las time when someone breaking my business. I can't really see the theft 's image. This unit provides almost 2k solutions. I can easily see the everything in the video even in very low light conditions. The instructions was pretty easy and clear instructions. The wifi setup was a piece of cake and work as expected. You can see the life time recording on your smartphone anywhere anytime. The night vision works great too. The hard drive gives us lots of recording time. The system are very user friendly. I am so happy with the product and it's capabilities.,"Was worried about the quality of the video because the reason I choose this camera is my wife like how it look, but the video quality turn out to be great(both day and night). All the pictures is from 3rd floor looking down, it look pretty clear on the app. The setup was very easy with the app ( I was too lazy to put a monitor to it.) The instructions was straight forward. I was surprised that it came with a mouse (I didn't needed but it's helpful if I ever going to plug it to a monitor)One downside after looking at the pic, the setup didn't ask for adjusting time so my time is off by 12hour. Another thing is I put the recorder in my computer room and the head for the plug is long so other stuff cannot plug next to it( I end out getting an extension cord just for it)","We got this for home use. We needed a wired system of cameras because our internet is not great. We wanted a system that would alert us on our phones, and didn't want a monthly subscription. We've only had it hooked up 5 days so far, so we still have much to learn, but so far, we're very impressed. I won't say set up was easy, but we did seem to get through it. Thankfully the system seemed to get all the ip info once we hooked up the ethernet cable because what we know about ip addresses is not much! Also, once you download the app, you scan a bar code with your phone from the screen display, and it linked them. After I scanned that bar code, I could see video on my phone if i clicked on the app, however, it took me 4 days to figure out how to get push notifications on the phone to alert me to motion at my house. The Annke website was much clearer to me than the booklet that was included - their website was where I finally figured out why I wasn't getting push notifications & got it fixed. I love the push notifications! Also very impressed with the ability to play with the motion detection - a grid will come up on the screen and you can delete sections from the picture - specifically we had a treeline in one corner that was blowing in the wind & kept setting if off, so we were able to delete that section on the grid. The picture quality is great. We have it hooked up to a tv monitor. Daytime pictures are very clear. I'll have to update this review on nighttime view because I don't think we have it set correctly. One of the cameras has a good nighttime picture, but one of them is just basically black. We can tell it's our backyard, but that's about it. But again, this may be a setting we need to tweak - will update review after we play with it some more. I haven't tried customer service yet, so I can't comment on that feature yet because we hooked it up on a weekend, and it is available Mon-Fri. My main reason for getting the system was the ability to monitor the house while I was at work during the day, and it seems to be working fantastic for that.","I bought this system to replace my 6+ yrs old system which was burned by a lightning. NOTICE: DVR's are powered by tranformer Power Supplys and camera's are not protect from lightning's, You need to place a Grownd cable on a marked bolt on the back of the DVR for that purpose( I didn't know it and had a big loss on old system) Camera's are very bright and clear. The digital Zoom is amazing. The field of view of one cam is outrageouse! The cameras feel too light, but do a great work. Im only concerned if they will hold a huricane in PR. I think I did a great buy! Oh the 2TB hard drive can hold over 30 days recording. Pairing with IP camera's was very easy. I can view and record my IP cams on the DVR(THAT IS AMAZING).

I haven’t try the app but so far I’m very satisfied with everything. Definitely recommend.","I'll be honest, I wasnt expecting much at all with this camera system, but wow am I suprised. Picture quality is as good as our night owl system costing much more, night vision is very clear even in low light or no light situations. This system doesnt come with a hard drive to record, but isnt very much to get one and install. It zooms very well on any frame, and has audio as well, but the audio quality seems a little staticy. Hookup is super easy, if you have a large house, definitely spring for the extra cables, you may need them. Otherwise you definitely wont be upset with this system if you want a security system on a budget. Good stuff",Wow. It's a nice security setup for the money. $90 for 4 cameras and a DVR. The DVR is very responsive and boots up quickly. Put in your own hard drive and you're good to go. The phone application works fine. You have to connect to a router for internet via lan network cable. I posted a photo of the camera on an old PC monitor. And a screenshot of my phone as well.

Stupid easy to install and setup, including the smartphone app.Picture is razor sharp.Installed my system with a dedicated power supply and custom length rg58 siamesed cables. Did not use any of the supplied wires or power adapters. Only used the DVR and cameras.Put the DVR and power supply in basement and ran all cables to them.Got a long HDMI cable and long USB cable so I can monitor and control everything from my nightstand while laying in bed.Everything works fantastic !!!","First, setup was not too bad, if you’re handy, it will be easy to install and program. Utilizing existing co-axial cables and stabilized power supply. One thing I really like about it is it comes with everything, so you can set it up directly without make additional trips to store for some cables/cords.* Images: The images displayed on the system are very clear and more remarkably. In a lower light environment they will switches to black and white. So the cameras apparently have very good light sensitivity.* View: These cameras have phenominal quality and the field of view is so much greater than my older cameras.I've only had this system for a couple of weeks, and don't even have all of the camera's connected yet (though I did test them). In a year, once I can speak to longevity, I will return to give an update to the product. So far, however, I'm very pleased.","I do not give out praise often; in fact, this is my first Product Review in 5+ years. But I absolutely had to share my experiences with Annke Tech Support as their level of assistance and patience and accommodation was nothing short of phenomenal. After initially emailing them, they evaluated my request and responded to me within 13 hours (time zone gap included) and said that Tech Support would reach out in 24 hours. They reached out in 2...just excellent. From there, they were extremely responsive to help me troubleshoot my issue and we emailed back and forth a few times. Eventually, THEY determined that email would not resolve the issue so we had a Remote Desktop Sharing session to efficiently find resolution. We lost connection at one point, and Tech Support even CALLED ME to make sure we were still able to proceed. About 30 minutes later, I'm all set and happily keeping their product. As I am sure many of you have experienced poor customer service at some point in your life, you can rest easy that this company cares about their product and customers. If a positive review on their customer service is not enough to convince you to buy....allow me to review their product.Summary  Customer Service is Unparalleled. Price is Excellent. Video Quality is Great. Setup is fairly straight-forward. Some improved/updated instructions would be beneficial, but manageable as is. Interface could be improved to enhance experience, but ok.I spent a decent amount of time reading product descriptions and reviews for Home Video Surveillance and simply could not find anything that matched the price or positive reviews. Sure, there are some eyebrow-raising comments in some of the reviews, but nothing truly concerning. Some folks are expecting too much out of Nightvision, in general. This system performs above its price point. Sure, there are $1,000+ systems out there that will outperform this product, but that's not what you are buying. This system is a great middle ground between buying one/two over-priced Nest or Ring cameras that are merely selling their name and buying a 'high-end' surveillance system, which is probably overkill for you home. If you really need a system like that, then you should probably consider moving to a better area. You are going to get enough product (8 cameras and a DVR and remote access) to satisfy almost everyone’s surveillance needs.The quick setup guide provided was fairly straight-forward. I was able to connect it to my Smartphone without issue, easy. Adding the SADP Tool to my networked laptop was a bit more effort. The link provided in the guide was not accurate / retired, so a quick search on Annke's website located the software then back to the guide to complete setup. Not the end of the world, just be patient. If you cannot find it, email them. My 'issue', which required Tech Support, was that remote connection via the Web was no longer supported, despite being included in the guide. While this was a bit deceiving and frustrating, Tech Support was able to find a work-around and use Port Forwarding to allow me the type of access I was interested in. Most people will probably not need this, but I prefer laptops over phones and tablets, so it was a deal-breaker for me if no resolution…plus I didn’t want to have to install the SADP Tool on all of my laptops (again, I may be abnormal as I have 4 laptops in my home, but just sharing my experiences). Thankfully, Annke was able to help.Other than that, just know that the SADP Tool, Web, and DVR (i.e. direct connection between DVR and Monitor) interfaces are not overly user-friendly, but with some tinkering, you get used to the buttons and how to use the system. Again, not that big of a deal when you consider what you are getting for the price.If you are debating between this product and a competitor, give Annke a shot knowing that they will take care of you if you need help.","Only had it up and running for a day but very happy with it.

No issues.,Steep learning curve but great after sales service.,Great CCTV set! Upgraded from a samsung CCTV,"Quality video, Great value for the money",Love the customer service,"I read the good/bad reviews on this system and decided to take a chance on it due to the functions that were advertised and the price. I am happy I bought this system so far. First thing I did was make sure it worked by connecting a cam to the DVR and firing the system up. All good. Then I planned the DVR location and I wired up all the cam wires up through the wall and across the attic. Had to purchase a set of two 25ft extension wires to reach the farthest 2 cam locations, but that was inexpensive and expected. The set comes with all 60ft cam wires. Connected everything to the DVR and bam!, 8 cam views all working and nice and clear. There are many settings and adjustments that can be made which the instruction book touches on very briefly. But I clicked around and got a grasp on what the DVR and cams can do. After a little while I figured out how the system works and how to navigate the menus. The camera adjustment instructions come with the individual cams, so there's two sets of instructions to refer to. I had no trouble setting up passwords or any initial registration. By the way, in addition to the night vision, the particular cameras in this set have a single bright LED security light (white light alarm) that lights up when the cam detects motion, which I really like. You have to set the light to come on for each cam, its in the DVR settings. I have the cam on my front porch set to use the security light, also to sound an alert beep on the DVR itself, which can also be set for each cam. That is separate from the alerts on the mobile app. The mobile app set up just fine and it actually works quite well. Right after I installed the system, I left town on a trip. I had no issues viewing all 8 cams from over 500mi away and I don't even have high speed internet on my end. I got alerts (when I turned them on) and could review the recorded footage on every single instance. It all just worked as advertised. Also, on this system, you can add up to 2 IP cams that connect with a cat5 cable directly to the wireless router that the DVR is connected to and it will pick them up. I may eventually get one of those to add a 9th cam.","So, we've been running this system for about 3 months. I'll save the good stuff to the end of the review. It is definitely a five star product.Initially we used the system's live view, just to monitor the outside activity as it happened around us. This was largely due to not being able to find the time we needed to fully commission the set up. For example, we couldn't get the mobile app. to work and couldn't bring it up on my PC without downloading one of those gaming apps.The system is complex...which is a good thing. There are many useful features such as line crossing and intrusion even face recognition and use an interactive grid to create areas to monitor, schedules to record and customizable notifications or actions such as LED security light activation, alarms etc. It is extremely versatile. Look, the user manual is about 300 pages long.All of that said, as much as we struggled with the set up, Annke's live chat tech was the answer to all of our problems. Demi, a real person, spent a long time and a exercised a ton of patience with our frustrating experience until we had everything up and running.In this day and age that alone is worth five stars. We give Annke, 10 out of 10!","Before using these unit I had a Samsung CCTV 4 channel camera and was looking to add 4 more. I had some concerns over this set as I have never used or heard of Annke before.Once I received the unit I noticed everything was well packaged nicely and everything I needed was inside the box.The cameras were straight forward to install just like my previous set so I had no issues.After connecting all the cameras, setting up the unit was straight forward with easy to follow on screen instructions. I didn't even need to use any manuals.The first thing I noticed when using Annke's software on the CCTV is that it was VERY quick compared to my Samsung CCTV. Everything was really snappy and didn't take much to move around the menu. It DOES NOT come with a remote like my samsung CCTV but this didn't bother me since the Annke system was very convenient and QUICK.Initial setup of all the cameras was SUPER easy you just need a little patience to browse the menu to learn it and youll have no issues getting it set up the way you want it.I have NOT tried the mobile app as I have other cameras with that functionality so I didn't need it.","The software has a lot of options, fairly straight forward setup if you’ve ever dealt with electronics.... the video quality and feeds are great, especially for the money. I will also add that I chatted with customer service real quick, and they were extremely fast to respond and very helpful. Thank you again!",We had an initial problem with the lights on these cameras not going when someone walked in front of the camera at night. I contacted customer service and they were phenomenal in helping me get this problem fixed. They sent me screen shots to show me step by step how to program them correctly.

Why on earth would they send it out without a waterproof lid and rubber seals for the network connector? I've installed thousands of these type cameras, and they ALL come with them. They claim it is an accessory, or it doesn't need it because it is built so much better. It looks the same as all the others. Even all their description pictures show it with the lid. I would include pictures showing it but there's nowhere to upload them. Look at the pictures.Edit: seller contacted me and offered to solve problem. Great customer service.","I first set up my 8 channels security camera system a few years ago, at that time, 1080p was the best resolution i could get. Everything is still working until now, however, recently, i've lost several packages due to package thief and the camera was able to catch the thief in action, however, its resolution is not high enough for me to clearly print out his picture and his face. I decided to purchase this 4k version camera to replace the existing one at my front entry door. There's a big difference in picture quality and clarity in the captured footage. With the enhanced resolution, i can actually zoom in on people face as they're entering the recording zone and be able to recognize and clearly see their faces. It's still a little pricey, but i guess if it does the job well then it's worth it.","Our house was equipped ADT cameras with the previous owner. It was okay to start with but I just can't bear with the ever going up contract price from time to time. I just tell myself enough is enough that I terminated the contract and started to build my surveillance. This one is my first attempt on the journey. The installation does take some effort in order to drill and mount on the wall. I just took advantage of the existing ADT power supply and signal cable which probably saved 90% of the time. With years advance in technology, the camera works way better than the ADT ones, especially at night. It can hardly tell it is a night vision if my front garage lights are on. The fancy feature with the app with email notifications are quite useful. So far I am happy with it and plan to get several more to build the full coverage around the house.","I bought this camera to be a part of an aurora detection system that I'm building. I wanted a 4K camera with really good low-light color sensitivity so it can catch the green of an aurora in the night sky and this looked like a really good candidate.The camera was easy to install and immediately generated real time day time 4K video that I could stream with VLC.I do need to be able to control the exposure though--the aurora when it first fires up can be faint--and here was my first stumbling block. Everything I tried to access and set regards exposure threw up an ""unauthorized user"" error! How can that be if the same user can stream video off this camera 'til the cows come home?It took a quick chat with tech support at Annke to point me to the correct place to set up an ONVIF user and once that was done I now have the ability to adjust a myriad of settings via python-onvif-zeep.I'm not quite where I want to be yet with the aurora cam -- my experiments with night vision are inconclusive (the clouds and now a full moon have not been helping ;-) but so far so good and time will tell.In summary, for the price it's hard to pass up a 4K camera with great low light capabilities for what this one can be had on Amazon--especially if you're the geeky type that wants to control the camera via software and not a pointy-clicky interface.","This is my first security camera, so I'm still a newbie to this technology. The camera came package well with all the parts inside. Connected the cameras up inside to ensure it works before installing on my house. I like the smaller size bullet cameras vs. the larger bullet cameras. Just one adjustment ring to aim the camera to your liking. The camera only comes in white. I spray-painted mine dark blue to match my house trim color, which hides the cameras more. Pro: The price, H.265+, smaller bullet size, picture quality. One ring view angle adjustment. Con: A little more night vision range. The included user manual reading print is a little small for my reading. Setup took a while; I suggest you watch a couple of youtube videos. The camera only comes in white; I wish they made it also in black. Overall I would repurchase this camera.",122,31,https://www.amazon.com/ANNKE-Security-Compression-Horizontal-Weatherproof/dp/B07V8H5QQ1/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=annke+security+camera&qid=1640230055&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&smid=A1HL8LTLNPXUW8&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEySDlBNFhDQ0pTOTBZJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzkwNDE5MjRUUko4VDhCOFhKMyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTY4Mjc1MU9TWVNMNUlUUzU5MCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

I can't get the app to work ...,Very Happy,This is a great system. 1,"I purchased this for keeping an eye on the exterior of my business. A single camera for my interior surveillance system is more than double the cost of this entire package so I wasn't expecting too much. After reading some positive reviews I decided to try it out. You will need to supply a hard drive and a monitor, otherwise it comes with everything you need for basic installation.Installation is the same as with any wired cameras and the level of difficulty will depend on your particular circumstances. Camera quality both day and night is pretty good. Again, keep in mind the cost of this system. If you are looking for CSI quality then be prepared to spend about $2000 dollars per camera and many times that for the system to record it. These cameras are very light seem cheap but have so far withstood temperatures in excess of 100 degrees and strong wind and rain. Only time will tell how long they will hod up and how well they withstand snow and cold.The DVR itself is small, light, and a bit flimsy. I was worried when I opened it up to install the hard drive and saw how unimpressive the inner components are. In fact, I was worried about damaging it by setting a small 15 inch LCD monitor on top of it. The DVR did fail to boot once during initial testing and had to be unplugged to restart it. The LED to indicate power on the front of the DVR stopped working after a day of use.The software is pretty straightforward and easy to use. There are quite a few options that are standard in professional systems but nice to see in such a low cost solution.I'm rating this product 5 stars for a DVR and cameras at such a low price that actually works decently. I'll update this review if components begin to fail.","Shipping was fast, I had an extra 500 gb laptop hard drive laying around. So why not! Wired it all together and positioned the cameras where we needed them. System works great. Now to get more cameras for the 8 channel. I would buy the extra cable for them they only come with about 60 ft.","DOES NOT COME WITH HARDDRIVE, but other than that it's a great value. I can't get the app to work either. It won't connect to my Wi-Fi. Picture quality is great. Really easy set up. Each camera comes with 100ft of cord which was more than enough.","Overall an awesome security set up, especially for price. This camera has caught my neighbor's dog crapping on my lawn and the same neighbor's kids hitting my car with their bikes on multiple occasions. Let's just say I have all the proof I need now to file some complaints. They have been doing these things all year but kept saying ""you don't have proof so they (landlords) can't touch me!""... Well, hope my neighbor has fun explaining my proof to the landlords :)The motion detection works well - maybe even too well, often times when there is a breeze and the bushes in the front lawn move, it will trigger a camera. Not really a problem, just proves how sensitive the camera is as far as detection goes.They've been in rain and wind and have held up well so far. Not sure about snow as I've only had them since the spring.You will definitely need to buy a memory card for this unit as it does not come with one.Set up for a not-very-tech-savy person such as myself was easy. Honestly I just use tape to hold the cameras on the wall instead of screws. So far has worked well.I would definitely buy this again if I ever needed to.","This is a great system.1.

Instead of being with he camera settings it is hidden in the mode area. However, Arlo has a lot of information online and was easy to resolve.",I upgraded from an Arlo Pro to the Arlo Ultra 2 Spotlight Camera and am quite satisfied. Build quality and image quality are excellent.,I swapped a Pro2 for a new Ultra2. It was easy to setup the new camera in the Arlo app. The camera position tool in the app made it easy to position the cameras view. The video quality is very good with some slight chromatic aberrations at high zoom levels at 20+ feet. The detection algorithm is also very good. It recorded a squirrel and correctly flagged it as an animal. Distance to the hub is probably 30-40 feet with one exterior wall in between.,"Unlike my experience with Arlo's wired doorbell and chime, the Ultra 2 cameras work fabulously. The batteries do not last the advertised length of time. Knowing that I ordered two extras and the charger. The main camera battery had to be exchanged every two days and the secondary camera in our carport every five days. I installed a third-party 3 watt solar panel designed for the Arlo for each camera. The solar panels keep both batteries charged at 100 percent. I think it will be a pain to review the recordings on the base station's mini SD card, so there is no question in my mind that customers purchasing the cameras will also need to purchase Arlo's cloud storage service once the free trial period is over. Customers need to have reasonable expectations. I have my camera's set at the best quality settings, but still, don't expect to be able to read license plate numbers, and the ""color"" in nighttime recordings is very marginal.","I purchased the Ultra 2 to replace an aged system. Once you see the video, you'll declare 4k video is the only way to go. I installed the two cameras outdoors myself, and I am far from being a home improvement guy. You'll love it. I also watch my camera feed at night on my Amazon Echo Show. Be mindful there is an update package for the cameras and the base. Do the quick download before installing. My system uses the 25' constant power supply accessory, too. No pesky battery replacement or charging issues. You'll love this...

Had to turn off night vision for better images using the built-in spotlight. It can be a hit or miss if you buy refurbished or maybe just incorrect configuration. Sometimes app will not find the hub/camera if you have VPN on your mobile device. It has to be turned off.Update: Bought an endurance 256GB Micro SD card, you can now view the videos from the app if you are at home. Set to save on the card and got rid of my subscription. You will not get the fancier options like activity zones and intelligent recognition but still works fine. It will probably hold thousands of hours of recording before it gets full then will replace the oldest. Downside is you can only access the recordings on the SD card if you are on the same wireless network but the cloud recording still works and is good for seven days for free. Overall a very good investment.","The camera itself is amazing. I love the quality of the picture, the features. It has night vision but also a bright LED light that can be turned off if it's a feature you don't prefer. 2 way audio! Makes it easy to talk to couriers and food service ppl even if you're away from home. Easy to set up. Did everything myself without help or support from ARLO. My only complaint is that I bought 2 cameras but it didn't come with 2 mounts. Not enough hardware included in my opinion. Would have loved to mount both cameras outside but I'm having to buy additional hardware for it when it should have come with it. My friend uses Arlo and she recommended it because she doesn't have to pay a monthly subscription but for the ones I bought (ultra 4k) I'm currently on a 3 month trial then I think they're going to make me pay a monthly subscription to continue using. I am pleased with the quality of the camera and it's features and being notified when it detects anything at the door and for doing the job it is ultimately supposed to do but I'm hoping I don't have to pay a monthly subscription and would have been better to be able to mount both cameras outside.","Re: the renewed product The firmware on the base unit is probably old as sin. When you plug on the power and internet, just walk away for about 30min to an hour. It needs to do stuff in the background and download new firmware. You might think you just bought a brick but you didn’t. It just needs to update. Everything else works as expected.","Bought and installed for someone else after a cheaper brand quit working about a year after installation. I came across these first when my landlord had them installed and was very impressed with them. The video quality, super easy setup, so many extra bonus settings you can set up if you desire, that’s what got me researching Arlo. After a couple month of looking into Arlo I decided that I was going to be my recommendation because I want to be confident in the brand I’m recommending to someone else, especially when it comes to security",Setup was very easy. Love that I can view the cameras on my iPhone and my desktop (although not simultaneously for some reason). The range from the base to the camera is not as good as I would hope but to be fair I have many stone walls throughout my home. I ended up using 2 base units which works seamlessly. Image is clear. Motion detect is awesome. I used 4 cameras (2 on each base) to cover the inside of my home in critical areas.

But it is still a nice wide view.To use it outside, I recommend ordering the exterior mounting bracket (not included) otherwise a crook can just reach up and pull the camera off the included base as it attaches via a magnet.So far, I am very pleased with the ease of installation and use of the camera. With this model you do not need to have the Arlo WiFi hub as you do with most of Arlo's other cameras. I didn't want to end up with all the extra equipment and this works great with my existing WiFi network.",,,,,25,1,https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Pro-Spotlight-Camera-Wire-Free/dp/B09HXZQ7BM/ref=sr_1_11?keywords=arlo+security+cameras&qid=1640230302&sr=8-11

Would definitely purchase another if the need arises as well as recommend Zosi.","These cameras provide a great, crisp, and clear picture and look very soaking with subtlety.

Initializing the cameras was fairly easy, although one wouldn't detect the QR code right away, but was fine after a factory reset.Additionally, consider buying directly from the Arlo website. I didn't realize until after I bought them that Arlo offers 1 year of protection against the theft of your cameras if you don't purchase them through a third party like Amazon. That piece of mind would have been worth it to me.I was surprised by the included mounting hardware. I expected to find 3 of the small magnetic mounts, which are attached to the wall with just one screw and to the camera with a magnet. I didn't think that sounded very secure, so I ordered 3 of Arlo's pivoting screw mounts. It turned out that the box of cameras contained 1 smaller pivoting screw mount already, though, so I am returning one of the ones I bought.",I have purchased three Arlo Pro 4 cameras. They connected to my WiFi network with ease. They promptly notify me when motion is detected. I've been extremely pleased with my purchases & will likely purchase another one.,"There was a robbery at gunpoint in the middle of the day on our street. The neighbors camera caught a lot of video that the police officers could use to catch and prosecute the guy. This is my first outside security camera I have ever had and I absolutely love it! I like that you can pause the notifications it send you for different periods of time. I also like that you can look at your videos and use a filter for it to only show you videos (in your history) of animals. In the app, you can also pause videos (or not) and zoom in while reviewing videos. I made a suggestion to the technology support that it would be nice to have the ability to select which zones (that you have set up) will trigger the camera. I asked him, “What’s the sense in setting up zones if you can’t pick and choose which zone(s) you want to monitor for a certain period of time?” (like, monitoring/triggering only zone 1 at night and monitoring all zones during the day) I had to set up my zones so that the tree branches would not trigger the camera when they blew in the wind. The only problem now is that the shadows of the tree branches on my driveway often trigger the camera. Overall, this is a great camera for the price and if I were to buy another one, it would be an Arlo.","The camera comes securely packaged and ready to operate after a quick battery charge. I did have a bit of trouble getting the owner's manual to download. It went fine on my iPad, but when I tried to get a backup copy to my laptop, I received an error number that then took me to a 'tech chat' option. Sadly, that was a connection to some scammers (in my opinion) who tried to sell me some very expensive and unnecessary security. They told untruths and pressured me a lot. Arlo needs to know this and the bad impression of the Arlo company they conveyed. The camera itself, though is fine and gives clear images. Just a warning here for folks who might run into the same situation.",,1383,359,https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Pro-Spotlight-Camera-Wire-Free/dp/B08L75YWZK/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=arlo+security+cameras&qid=1640230302&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVE9CNlA4WVJPMTlaJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTUyNjU4MU9YSkg2RUtLRDJIOSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNzExNzc3Mkc3Sk0yNThKSFNWJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

After beating my head against the wall trying to get it all to work, I gave up 2 weeks ago. Frustrated with trying to keep the wireless cams online, I yanked them and threw them in the garbage (literally). I purchased a Pro 3 and a Pro 2 separately along with the Ultra Smarthub to start off. Kind of sticking my toe in the water, I ran this for a week. Setup was ridiculously simple. Not over stating either. Performance exceeded my expectation by a lot. The big issue for people is loading speed. I'll just say before I had the Amcrest WiFi I had Ring which was even more frustrating. Not a good experience at all. Really long load times or just hanging. So far with Arlo, I can trace every issue directly to something on my network. I added 2 more Pro 3's just to make sure I wasn't just experiencing an anomoly. The network can keep up with the cameras no problem. Snappy response to load. Does Arlo ever hang or slow perform. ABSOLUTLEY! But very very infrequently once you get clean WIFI. Move that router as far as you can from the Arlo HUB. Remember, Arlo uses it's own little private network, so you just need to provide the hub with clear wired connectivity. Also make sure your cameras have as much unobstructed path to the hub. I have a Camera on the other side of my 3,000 square foot house. I have 4 bars. I added the Ultra to my now 5 camera set up. Wow! Even more gorgeous! Great Cam, field of view is amazing, covers my whole front house including the porch. I would recommend to a friend. I do have to be honest, the Pro 2 is very very disappoining. Color bleeding is bad at night. Night vision is pretty much unusable. I bought all my cameras but one refurbished. No issues at all, perfectly packed with all accessories. All pieces came EARLY. yea!!! I absolutely love this system so far!!!!","We had a little security scare a few weeks ago and decided to purchase a security camera system. I have to say I'm super impressed. Sharp video quality, local storage capability, security light, motion sensor, siren, e911, easy install, two-way communication and HomeKit compatibility. What more could you want!? The local storage and HomeKit compatibility is what really sold me though. I only wish the HomeKit integration was a little deeper (Secure Video please!!)...but HomeKit integration is at least there which is was a requirement for me. Some of the other reviewers complaints seem like they're rooted in poor wifi signal...you're dealing with 4K video so the units obviously need strong signal outdoors. I've had zero issues. Definitely feeling safer and would totally reccomend!!",The video is great if the cameras have a really good signal but the videos are Vero slow in loading if the signal is less then 3 full bars,"The Arlo Ultra camera system I had recently purchased has worked like a charm. I am now able to have a peace of mind while sleeping or not home. I was able to locate a camera fairly far and high up on a pole and this monitors the front of the property as well as whom enters our culdesac. In return, if someone has problems or a break in within the neighborhood. We could possibly review the footage and perhaps catch a license plate if they are not on foot . Although the cameras have been installed for one week exactly. Very little issues with them. Just be sure your wireless range can handle the distance unless you buy a wireless repeater to extend the range.","We have 6 of these with 2 home docks and we love them. They show great picture quality and the battery life last pretty good as long as you turn off the notifications every time it detects something. We bought 6 from Best Buy but we recently had to purchase another one because my daughter knocked it off the window and it broke something. This was easy to sync to the home base and start using right away. They run off wifi, we have really bad internet and these still work okay. You can speak over them from the app but with our slow wifi it’s hard for you to hear someone talking back or it’s delayed a little.",781,57,https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Ultra-Wire-Free-Spotlight-Compatible/dp/B08D7WPBXV/ref=sr_1_12_sspa?keywords=arlo+security+cameras&qid=1640230302&sr=8-12-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVE9CNlA4WVJPMTlaJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTUyNjU4MU9YSkg2RUtLRDJIOSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDM3MjE5M0s2MzJYSU4yN1o5MiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

I am a long time Arlo Customer. I have two original Arlo Cams, two Arlo Pro Cams, an Arlo Pro 2 Cam and 4 Security Lights. I am also an existing Smart Premier subscriber and pay $9.99/month. I recently added the Arlo Ultra 2 Camera System and SmartHub to my existing set up. I assumed my Smart Premier Service would automatically revert to a free year of service. NOT so. After an extensive amount of time with Arlo Customer Service to sort this out, I finally learned that in order to get the 1 year free of Smart Premier you must CANCEL your existing Smart Premier subscription BEFORE you add your SmartHub or Ultra Cameras to your existing set up. If you don't cancel your subscription before adding the SmartHub/Ultra Cameras you will not get the benefit of the free 1 year of service. To fix this, you will have to cancel your subscription and then remove the SmartHub (with a 'hard"" reset from the back of the unit) and then reinstall it all and set up Smart Premier again. In fairness to Arlo, their customer service was great and the person who help me was incredibly patient and helpful. Apparently many folks are having this same issue so I thought it would be helpful to post this since I found nothing about it on any of the Arlo Support forums.Other than this minor issue, I have to say that setting up the SmartHub and Cameras was seamless and even easier than setting up the Arlo Lights or my previous Arlo Hub/Cameras. Video quality is great and the 180 degree view is a game changer. I can now see the entire inside of my Garage with just 1 camera. Audio quality is also much better than the Pro 2. The Ultra is pricey, but if you are looking for the best camera available (from any provider), then this is it.","I replaced my Arlo Pro's with these Ultra's. I am so glad I did. The picture is excellent and the setup took me all of 10 minutes. You don't have to individually set up cameras anymore. Just plug the access point into your router and open your app. It will find the cameras automatically. No more scanning QR codes and such. The cameras have a great night picture as well as a new led light you can turn on and off. The Free yr of the Smart Recording system was a nice extra. I have not measured the bandwidth yet, but make sure you don't have Bandwidth limits from your internet provider before you take the plunge to upload everything to Arlo's cloud.Also I will be adding the Solar panel to my setup for my Driveway. I'll leave a review for that next.","Got it from the very first release and did not have any issues at all. Yes some did, but I have been pleased from the start. Mixed in with my pro 2 cameras and had no issues with setup or connection. Very pleased. The only con was I had to wait so long to write my review.","Fantastic Upgrade from Pro or Pro 2. Rough start initially, as I bought my first set on initial launch at BB. Arlo has corrected the major bugs that affected me. I bought a second 4 pack once FW improved. Currently I have 8 Ultra cams, each with 4k recording upgrade. I may switch 2 cams to CVR plan once outdoor power cable becomes available. 5 of 8 cams are hooked up to the Solar Panel accessory & they're working great too. Really looking forward to additional accessories becoming available and future FW updates improving the cams even more. Not an inexpensive system but reasonably priced for me. Annual cost will be under 300 USD (annual payment plan) after initial free year of Arlo Premium and including the 30 days of 4k motion triggered cloud recording upgrade on all 8 cameras.I'll try to answer any questions directed to me. I don't work for Arlo & I still have a couple Arlo Pro cams that I'll eventually upgrade to Ultras to round out the 10 camera limit on my plan.","Super happy, wow.

I got to say, the night vision of this camera is simply incredible. I have been using it for some days now and everything just runs so smoothly. The app that comes with it is something that doesn’t get enough credit for. It makes it so easy to monitor what’s happening outside which makes my family and I feel safe all the time. Another great feature is that the camera is completely water proof. There was a hurricane the other day when I thought the camera wasn’t going to make it. To my surprise, it stood unaffected. I’ll definitely recommend this product to my neighbors!","This camera beats my expectation. It was very easy to setup, I was able to connect and perform software update in minutes, I got it up and running in about 15 minutes or so. Its almost easy as plug and play type of deal. The best part, it take SD card for extra storage, so I don't need to pay for cloud storage. The connection is strong, camera app is very responsive and connects quickly. Picture quality is excellent, its better than my other cameras. The sensor works quite well, I tested it out and put it next to my baby video monitor in my son's room, the motion detection works better or as good, and the video quality is much clearer, both runs on the same WIFI. I think I will buy two more, since I already have their app on my phone.","I purchased this to keep an “eye” on my teens as my husband and I went out of town. I loved getting notifications when they were headed to school or sitting down to eat. Now we’re back home we’ve installed it out by our front door and are very happy with the range, quality and integration with our phones.","I love this product, it is very easy to setup and the picture quality is excellent. This is perfect for outdoor or indoor use as it has a very sleek design. This wireless camera is perfect for any person's home -- highly recommend!","I put it on my garage. The picture quality is much better than I thought, even at night. There is one function which I like the most is recording function. It will automatically record 10 seconds if it detects any motion.

I originally purchased the Blink camera system because I was thrilled with having month long battery life and the tiny profile cameras I could mount in the corner of my room.They served me well for a time, but like many people I began having major privacy concerns when Amazon purchased them. Eufy's camera systems are different. No footage is uploaded to the cloud and instead all of your video lives locally on your device. Eufy claims it is encrypted, but I wish they would specify if their employees have any way to ever access the footage or not. Some clarification on the privacy end of things would help further set them apart from Blink and their other competitions.I decided to take a chance on the Eufy 2C after having an amazing experience with Eufy's video doorbell.I'm so glad I did! The cameras are low profile and blend in easily in corners or even just mounted to walls. The base station is quite small and looks right at home next to my router, and the app works instantly with no headache. The cameras have crisp video and audio and Eufy provides easy-to-follow instructions for mounting. I do wish the mounts were magnetic or had a way to quickly remove the cameras for charging. Thankfully, after several days I haven't gone down a single tick in battery life so I am hopeful charging will be few and far between. Notably missing is Homekit support and expandable storage, but Eufy promises us that both of these features are coming soon. They seem to have a good track-record for customer service so I am hopeful.Below I will provide some pros/cons but to be honest none of the cons are dealbreakers, just things I hope Eufy will consider for their next software updates and product iterations.This is the best security camera system I have ever used and one of the simplest setups as well. I can't recommend this product enough! Go buy it!Pros:-GREAT video quality-Spotlight functionality-Seamless App and great wireless range-Good installation instructions-Battery life/USB charging-RTSP (record to your network or NAS!)-Clear audio & 2/way audio-Good nightvision performance-Recording light-Built-in sirens on each camera and homebase-AI detection means my pets don't set off the cameras (THANK-YOU!)Cons:-No HomeKit Support-No Geofencing (Auto arm on leaving and disarm on arrival)-16GB/ No way to expand storage with USB or SD (yet)-Mounts are cumbersome, magnetic would be a lot easier to remove for charging-No way to re-arrange order of cameras in the app","Overall I got this over the Arlo system. Price of the immediate purchase and since no monthly fee it was a no brainer. I did. I two sets 2c and Eufycam 2. I needed two hubs to reach my backyard and front corner of my house. About the furthest two points from each other. Hub range could be better as it has trouble going through walls.Clarity is goodDetection is about 90%. I think it may require time to ‘settle’. For example I setup and kept walking in front of it and it did t go off for a day. Was about to return when it started working. So do give it a chance. Start with all motion and high sensitivity, and go down from there or switch to human mode.The light is triggered manually. If I really cared I would have taken off a star but I don’t need that feature.Note the 2c has a siren but only for alerts. The Eufycam 2 has a siren for tampering which is nice. Haven’t tested either siren.Charge it up when you receive. I started at 40% out of the box but it dropped quick. Again almost returned it. But I charged to 100% and it’s been fine since then.There is only motion and human motion detection. Kept seeing AI mentioned for face detection, neither camera had that (I had hoped the Eufycam 2 had it). Alerts do try and show a face if it caught one, but not the face identification I read about.Eufycam 2 has better battery and that tamper siren, but other than that not much difference (size shape etc). So I’d suggest buying when there is a good deal and buy two sets while at it for the extra hub.","So I'm updating my previous review from last year from 4 stars to 5. I love Eufy products and have cameras, smart bulbs, vacuums, etc. Was having an issue with these cameras falsely reporting motion when the camera would wake from its sleep mode, that would cause tons of motion alerts 24/7. Worked with their support for a while but didnt seem to have a fix at the time. Now 6 months later their support reached out to me that they pushed new code and to check it now, it does seem they resolved the issue. I recommend Eufy all the time because of their top notch customer support and they have great products at a great price.","My wife bought this as my birthday present. What I really liked this so far is the over box and camera design and user experience. The package seemed really classy from the plastic wrap (tightened) to the unfolding of the corrugated lid.The item I got were HomeBase and the two cameras 2C. The installation was fairly easy and quick. I really liked the use of the app that was downloaded from Google Play Store per the instructions said.The overall camera quality's awesome as I used one for indoor and the other for backyard. The motion detector is great at the sensitivity level (default). I think for a beginner like me, this is a great fit.",8500,1,https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Security-eufyCam-Wireless-180-Day/dp/B07X5W6QB1/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=battery+powered+security+camera&qid=1640229289&sr=8-10

I updated the firmware to 10.48 and it worked. You can update camera firmware in the camera profile settings. You need the Blink outdoor camera with a USB connection. Connecting the USB cable can be tricky but take your time you'll get it. Best to plug it in then snap the camera in place.A quality item for the price, the LED chips appear to be very decent, the plastic lenses and housing are good quality, I think they'll stand up well to weather and sun exposure if needed. After updating my camera's firmware, installation was very straight forward.. you remove a plastic strip on the battery contacts, plug the USB cable into your camera, then snap it in place. The app recognizes the install and you adjust settings in that camera's profile. You'll see lighting icons appear in that camera's profile screen (see pic). Lights are bright enough to illuminate a small area, and you get a color pic & video instead of grey IR if it's dark. I wanted the ability to illuminate a side of my house should anyone decide to walk around the area.","This mount is NOT compatible with the XT, XT2 or any of those older generation cameras. Install was easy, though i recommend a cordless drill if you have one. You have the ability to turn the light on and off on demand and of course you can control the duration of lighting when the camera's sensor triggers it. It's 700 Lumens, which is plenty light between the two strobes. I have no complaints. The negative reviews are from those who've mistakenly purchased the setup without making sure the camera model they have actually works with the setup. If in doubt, you may just want to get the camera and floodlight kit. Good luck.","First, please be aware this works with the Blink Outdoor cameras, as stated in the description. Installation was very easy. Just have to mount the back plate and the flood light slides right on and locks into place. The camera can be a little tricky to get plugged into the light but once it is plugged in you can tell it is secure. Immediately after plugging in the flood light the Blink App automatically detected it and added the light controls to the camera it was plugged into. So far it seems to work well at night. Lights up the area really well and can definitely tell a difference in the video at night with the flood light as opposed to the IR Night Vision recordings. I am very pleased with this flood light mount.","I bought this to primarily do two things: 1) draw attention to the external camera and 2) provide me light when I'm taking out the trash at night and it works super well for both those reasons.Regarding the first reason, I consider cameras primarily to be a deterrent and something that discourages bad behavior but won't actually prevent it. By adding a floodlight to my camera I'm hoping to draw more attention to it and encourage people to maybe think twice. The lights are super bright so there is no way that people will miss that they are on camera so to me this accomplishes what I'm looking for. I was initially worried about mounting this as I rent a house however the floodlight comes preinstalled with a siding shingle so I was just able to hang it like before.Regarding the second reason, well like most people I'm lazy. I could use my smart phone flashlight when taking out the trash but it's easier to have a light automatically come on when I step out the back. Again the lights are super bright so I have no trouble seeing at night. The flood light an be configured regarding how long to stay on when triggered for 15, 30, 60, 120, or 300 seconds so good control capability there.Overall I'm pretty happy with it. It isn't life changing but it does what I need it to do and I have no complaints.","This product was easy to add to my existing Bilnk system. Camera works great. Problem was that the lights were not recognized. Two issuers there. One, me. I did not notice that I should open the back AND remove the plastic covering the back of the batteries.

I have zero complaints! The set up is ridiculously easy (you literally just screw the base onto whatever you're attaching it to and then screw the camera onto the base. No wires or anything. The battery life isn't bad either. We've had it up for about 2 months now and have only had to charge it once I believe. You can set how sensitive you want the motion detection to be and if you put in an SD card you can view 10 second video clips of whatever set the camera off. If you don't put an SD card in you just get photos. Either way it's not a bad deal. I definitely plan on ordering this brand/camera if we decide to add any more cameras to our home. I will say that our two are not in the rain (under the carport or an awning) so I can't speak to how well they hold up in weather but we have had our original camera for probably a year now and it works just as well as when we first got it.",The camera works great on our garage. It’s pretty far away from the router and it still picks up the signal. Highly recommend this camera to everyone.,"I bought this to watch my chickens to make sure they are safe. It doesn't pick up when the chickens walk by or any animal. It only picks up tall objects such as people. plus my internet is not strong enough outside. So,I need to call the internet service and see what I can do. Also, need to move it lower to the ground to see if it will pick up any animals such as the chickens, cats, coons, squirrels, skunks etc.","I love this camera to monitor my household while I’m out of town. Very clear picture. Lots of storage, and clear audio. This is a quality product and highly recommended.",Camera’s motion detection and camera’s battery life is great.

I found these and thought they would be a quick and easy answer to my problem.Shipping was quick and easy and everything showed up in great shape.Out of the box, everything looked great. The installation is fairly simple, and it comes with all the required hardware. The batteries will need to be charged a while in order to ensure the battery life is optimal. After charging them overnight, I installed the mounts, slid the battery into place, and followed the instructions on the app. After a short wait everything was set up and ready to go.These have been up for a while now and I have absolutely nothing bag to say. As long as you have wifi boosters around the house, you should not run into any issues with connectivity or lag. The notifications are great, and the video clarity is exactly what I was looking for. Additionally, this system allows you to post possible issues to the neighborhood so your neighbors can be made aware of issues. For example, I recently saw a lady had her package stolen off her front porch and they managed to get the whole thing on video.Overall, I would absolutely recommend these for someone that is looking for a simple solution to a home security video system. This allows you to be literally anywhere and still check on things around the property. I would am extremely happy with this product and will continue to do business with them in the future.","Love these cameras. I bought the 2 pack 7 weeks and 1 day ago when I discovered someone was peeking in our windows and testing our locks, and just had to change the battery today. The front camera goes off 4ish times per day (when we go to and get home from work), and the battery was at 5% this morning. Our back porch camera goes off about 1-2 times per week and was at 37% this morning. I live in upstate NY so these cameras were installed in single-digit weather, and the batteries have now lasted through into the warmer 50-60 degree days. I'm amazed at how long the battery life has lasted and the quality of the video. I love that I can see my packages get delivered (the delivery man even waves at the camera), the quality of the video is amazing, and I can go back and watch old footage as well as go to a live view whenever want. The spotlight is great for helping with night vision and I love that I can talk to whoever is in front of the camera. Definitely recommend. Purchased a second battery for each camera to extend the battery life (have not put them in yet; this review is on a single battery in each camera) and look forward to getting 3+ months of battery life out of each camera.","I was reluctant to have to spend any money on outside cameras but all my research pointed me to Ring products. Price point on the wireless spotlight cameras is excellent and once I got the cameras, installation was so easy. I have had them about a week and everything works well. Only major complaint that needs to be addressed asap by the company is recording time. We need full event recording rather than short clips. Only recording the first 30 seconds does nothing if a burglar or nefarious person waits 30 seconds to rob you. It should at least start re-recording after the 30 sec period if motion is still detected. This can mean the difference between catching a thief or not. It must be addressed immediately! If they fix that then they will have a much better rating!","FOLLOW-UPJust when I thought I was Ringless, I finally spoke to a Ring rep over the phone and was very pleased with the next step. Not only did Ring understand my frustration, they were aware that my camera was not displaying. Ring sent me a replacement camera and emails wanting to know more. A review of a company should note the wrong and a follow up when they make it right. I recommended Ring to my friends and family when I bought it in 2019, I standby their product therefore ""I"" standby my Endorsement. Thanks RING!","I love these, and how easy they integrated with the ring door bell we already had, After they arrived, I realized based on placement, they option of 2 batteries versus one was the way to go, so I didn't have to keep on getting up on the ladder and charging, (which takes several hours) and be without coverage.The wifi even when it was 7 feet away with a window between, we had problems connecting, I would get a notification, and moments later it might pull up. That too is random when it does that.The motion is fabulous, I had to place one really high to capture the back yard 2 stories up, and it catches everything, to the point I had to scale back sensitivity, and shut off one side of it, as my tree would move. One thing I would love to see Ring do with these, is allow you to draw out the objects triggering the motion sensor like on the door bell. This one, you just turn of sections.Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to consider these, just know going in the things that are small hiccups.",2750,119,https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Spotlight-Cam-Battery-Security/dp/B07K7CSVJ8/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=battery+powered+security+camera&qid=1640229289&sr=8-14

This is the one!!,ZEEPORTE has redeemed my confidence in wireless security cameras!,Security Camera outdoor,For the price this camera exceeded my expectations.,OUTSTANDING CAMERA!,"My criteria for security cameras is as follows:1) Good quality picture2) Triggers at good distances3) Records videos locally (no monthly fee and privacy)4) Low number of false triggers5) A good phone app to control the cameras and view the videos.6) A reasonable priceThe Zeeporte camera checks all of the above boxes.I'll start here by saying that I've tried Eufy 2C, Vava, and Blink X2C systems. They are all more expensive (and sometimes much more expensive) than the Zeeporte. But the Zeeporte is a superior system to all that I've tried so far.The battery life of this camera is decent. I've used it heavily over the past 6+ days with many tests. I've recorded 209 motions and it is at 89%. Since I've used it heavily, I'll estimate 10% per week which means that it'll last 10 weeks (2.5 months) on a charge. In regards to size of the memory card that you'll need, I've used .22GB of the 120 GB card that I bought. At the current rate, it will record for 1.5 years before getting full - and then I'll just reset it. It is easy to transfer clips to your phone storage (online for my iphone).When I did my testing, I set it to the motion detection sensitivity to the highest value (95). What really impresses me with this camera is the low number of false triggers.. Really, I get none. It records people and cars and that is it. And it does not seem to miss any events. The angle of the camera did affect the distance of the triggering so try different angles.The only area of improvement that I can see is the mount. It is fine, but as I noted in my headline, I've tried several brands now including Eufy, Vava, and Blink. All of these brands had superior mounts, but the one that Zeeporte mount is fine. I had to make sure I tightened it well. One note - the other manufacturers that I listed require base stations and do not record on the camera itself. The Zeeporte does. This means if someone steals your camera, then they will get your videos. So, just don't put your camera within reach. A camera should not be mounted low and the instructions tell you to not do so. This is probably another reason that Zeeporte does not have a magnetic mount.. which would make it easy to steal. The mount that it has requires you to screw it off.Oh.. I just remembered another great feature of the Zeeporte. After your day is finished, you can view the events for the day (and all prior days) in a mode that shows you a timeline and lets you quickly sweep to each event based on the time and watch it. This is really nice to have!Overall, I do recommend it 100%","Last night was a disaster for me as I tried to get another brand of security cam to activate, I spent at least 5 + hours agonizing over the instructions, questioning my own intelligence and more 'Is it me?', I kept asking self.Long story short, it wasn't me, it was the product, and so going to return it.But smartly I ordered two security cams by two different companies and I'm here to say that 'ZEEPORT' has redeemed my happiness and joy and confidence in my ability to set up wireless WIFI connected security cameras...Also I timed it, from time I started activation to time it was up and running and it took less than 25 minutes!...I""m sure those more tech savvy than myself could do it in 15 or 10 minutes or less, I kid you not.Yes I'm a bit emotional cause coming off of a bruising night fooling around with that other security 'dome' camera system, which iI will not name, but if seek out my other review, you may stumble upon it...so yes I'm estatic right now cause ZEEPORTE delivered to me what they promised, a product that works right out of the box, a product to where you don't have to be a computer scientist to figure out, and all along the way, through each step, on your phone there's a 'help tab', in case you need help.Their 'help' doesn't hide from you.In closing, to be honest this can't be considered a totally full review, cause I haven't left my home yet and tried viewing camera from afar, until I do that, only consider this a 50% review.But will say WIFI connection was super easy...I mean super easy, compared to lasts night nightmare with other product (actually it was easy also, but after wifi connected to product their 'network' did not function).Anyways, so far so good with this product and will give another review as soon as can test away from home and see how it does then.It's a outdoor camera, but I have it indoors for now since other products failed me, I will order more though, probably from this brand, we shall see.","I love this camera, it gives great night vision even when my yard light is not on. Motion detection is great it alert me on everything it captures including the garbage man waking me up not to miss my trash guy, The birds in the attic, The neighbour talk. Even when it very windy and something is blowing across the street. Picture quality is absolutely awesome and incredible clear as day light. I call see all three of my neighbors home including mine. The voice quality is very good. If you asked me if I would recommend this camera to anyone else I would not hesitate to yes. I would recommend this to everyone. That's one reason. Why I gave this camera a 5 star. Yes it will video when you tap on the screen to see what going on for as long as you wish. The installation is easy all you have to do is charge for how long the instruction says. I have not charge mine since I put it up and it still has a full battery. This is a great gift and if you live alone and travel it's great to have because you can also put on the away button on your camera. . Ank me again and I will tell I am getting ready to purchase a second one for my home. I wish they came in a double pack. It gives me a piece of mind when I sleep at night to know I am safe. If I could give this camera a 10 out of 10 I would. I surely recommend this to anyone who is looking to purchase a camera for their home.","For my first ever security camera I am highly impressed. I needed a battery operated camera with easy installation and this one is perfect. Set up was easy, it was mostly charged when I received it and I easy drilled it to a tree. WiFi connection is excellent, picture quality is pretty good and the night vision is really good. I noticed the picture quality is better on sunny days rather then really cloudy days. You can change the motion detection, watch live, download videos and delete video all from the free app that you download. Honestly for the price I think I that this camera is pretty awesome and far better then I actually expected. You need a microsd card and to download an app. Other then that everything else is a piece of cake. I would recommend this camera.","I was sceptical at first on purchasing this security camera.I was looking for a really good security camera for the outside of my house.I have simplysafe for my home security system and have there camera as well inside but am not impressed with putting one of there security camera outside of the house.after reading the reviews on this camera.I figured that I would take the chance with it and see how it would perform.after unboxing the camera,and going thru the instructions which were very easy to understand.I figured I would just stick the camera temporarily inside the window seal and see how it would perform, before I mount it.and I must say that I was more then pleased with the clarity of the picture.as you can see from the above pictures.shooting thru the window from the distance that I had it was outstanding. Which I plan to install outside which will work great with my motion lights outhere. As far as the motion sensor it picks up motion great .you can adjust in the setting to suit you,it also has a home mode along with an away mode...as far as battery life I will have to up date in a later review.it came fully charged and seems to be holding pretty good.I must say if you are looking for a really good security camera,I believe you will be more then impressed with this one.Hands down it beats my simply safe cam hands down and for alot less priced.",4677,1,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Rechargeable-Surveillance-Waterproof-Detection/dp/B086V5H1YQ/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=battery+powered+security+camera&qid=1640229289&sr=8-9

Simple to follow instructions and if you have 2 brain cells to rub together, they are a cinch to have up and running in less that 5 min per camera and 10-15 for the door bell (but that’s just bc of the swapping out of the old unit.) DO be sure to check your transformer voltage to ensure compatibility.Be aware that one of my cameras came with a dead battery, but I charged it to 50% and went ahead and got it booted up. The other battery arrived at 45%. So if you initially can’t get your camera to power up, try charging the battery before freaking out, calling and bitching, posting on every known social media app and all that jazz.The night vision on the cameras is “OK” at best.

I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't. None. Not a single thing.It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways. I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed. Nope.I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house. Nope. There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not. They are not location aware in any way. The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording. Nope!The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours. Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room. I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on. This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%. This is with all the 'battery saving options' on. This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording. So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing. I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality. The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.***UPDATE***Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera. You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then. Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't. Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera. The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support. Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.***ANOTHER UPDATE***From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"". This will be a great update and should have been available on launch. I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.***ONE MORE UPDATE***Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days. It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration. With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set. They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away. For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off. You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc. Or any combination. The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can. This is a great improvement. They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5. This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras. I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.***LAST UPDATE***Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I've had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now. All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night. Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn't bad. I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it's pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation. They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you're thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them.","Before I start my revised review, let me state that there's been a lot of news lately about people hacking into Ring cameras, but this only happens when someone installs a new camera and doesn't update the default username and password (or has an extremely weak password which is easy for a hacker to guess). This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions.Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product.Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all.Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement.A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring.Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised.***UPDATE***Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices.Ring has now updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new wireless battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well.Observations.Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool.I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a few months before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent.I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once.Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete.I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic.Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.","Had the camera up and running in less than ten minutes. Excellent quality picture. Hooking up to the solar panel when installing, this way battery is always charged. Received mounting hardware, camera has been installed.",Installed 2 of these outside my house in about 20 minutes. Mounted one above my garage and the other near my front door. The video quality is pretty good. Not facial recognition software good but good enough for a good description of people if needed. I used the mounts that came will the camera and scanned the QR code for setup. Not sure why people couldn't set up zones. It is part of the setup unless you skip over the steps. I do agree with most reviews that the notifications are spotty. Took my trash out and the one by the garage only recorded me going to the side of the house and the one by the front door only recorded me coming back. A neighbor walked by this morning and it started recording after they walked by and were down the street. Pic attached. Went outside again and the both cameras picked me up as I would have expected. I will adjust the camera and reset the zones to see if that helps. They are my first Ring cameras so there may be fine tuning on my part that is needed. Will update this as the days go by.Windows 10 app logs me in but says I don't have any cameras set up. Tried on a PC and 2 laptops. Please fix!!Phone apps are pretty good so far. (Samsung note 9)Updating to 5 Stars.....After adjusting my zones and motion settings I was able to get the results I needed. At one point the wind blew leaves across my driveway and my sensor went off. After fine tuning I see no issues with the camera and its performance. It is by far better than other cameras I have purchase over the years and after comparing subscriptions from other companies $10 a month or $100 is a deal.,Don’t let any negative reviews influence your decision to buy these cameras. The negative reviews are from people who have not read the instructions or just have no idea how a security camera works. I monitor 16 security cameras where I work so I have a lot of experience with them. I bought the Ring Stick up camera and the solar charger for it as well. They both work great. I bought two more a week later. Now a month later I have no issues with battery power loss of any kind. Just set your zones to cover what you want. Don’t put motion sensor on full or you will catch bugs and falling leaves. I set my sensitivity in the middle. The image quality day and night is pretty good. You can also look at your cameras from a computer as well as your phone. You don’t need an Alexa to use these. The microphone works well too. Overall I would highly recommend these if you just read and understand the instructions and how they work which is very simple and easy.MD in SC 1-1-21,35984,1,https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Stick-Up-Cam-Battery-HD-security-camera-with-two-way-talk-Works-with-Alexa-/dp/B07Q6ZZFLS/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=battery+powered+security+camera&qid=1640229289&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzQVM0RktHTlo2UTdVJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTY0NzgzT1pKV0FXTkZBQ1VFJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3MjY4NDIySzVMVTFUMVRVTk8md2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl

It was easy to setup the new camera in the Arlo app. The camera position tool in the app made it easy to position the cameras view. The video quality is very good with some slight chromatic aberrations at high zoom levels at 20+ feet. The detection algorithm is also very good. It recorded a squirrel and correctly flagged it as an animal. Distance to the hub is probably 30-40 feet with one exterior wall in between.,"Unlike my experience with Arlo's wired doorbell and chime, the Ultra 2 cameras work fabulously. The batteries do not last the advertised length of time. Knowing that I ordered two extras and the charger. The main camera battery had to be exchanged every two days and the secondary camera in our carport every five days. I installed a third-party 3 watt solar panel designed for the Arlo for each camera. The solar panels keep both batteries charged at 100 percent. I think it will be a pain to review the recordings on the base station's mini SD card, so there is no question in my mind that customers purchasing the cameras will also need to purchase Arlo's cloud storage service once the free trial period is over. Customers need to have reasonable expectations. I have my camera's set at the best quality settings, but still, don't expect to be able to read license plate numbers, and the ""color"" in nighttime recordings is very marginal.","I purchased the Ultra 2 to replace an aged system.

I expected to find 3 of the small magnetic mounts, which are attached to the wall with just one screw and to the camera with a magnet. I didn't think that sounded very secure, so I ordered 3 of Arlo's pivoting screw mounts. It turned out that the box of cameras contained 1 smaller pivoting screw mount already, though, so I am returning one of the ones I bought.",I have purchased three Arlo Pro 4 cameras. They connected to my WiFi network with ease. They promptly notify me when motion is detected. I've been extremely pleased with my purchases & will likely purchase another one.,"There was a robbery at gunpoint in the middle of the day on our street. The neighbors camera caught a lot of video that the police officers could use to catch and prosecute the guy. This is my first outside security camera I have ever had and I absolutely love it! I like that you can pause the notifications it send you for different periods of time. I also like that you can look at your videos and use a filter for it to only show you videos (in your history) of animals. In the app, you can also pause videos (or not) and zoom in while reviewing videos. I made a suggestion to the technology support that it would be nice to have the ability to select which zones (that you have set up) will trigger the camera. I asked him, “What’s the sense in setting up zones if you can’t pick and choose which zone(s) you want to monitor for a certain period of time?” (like, monitoring/triggering only zone 1 at night and monitoring all zones during the day) I had to set up my zones so that the tree branches would not trigger the camera when they blew in the wind. The only problem now is that the shadows of the tree branches on my driveway often trigger the camera. Overall, this is a great camera for the price and if I were to buy another one, it would be an Arlo.","The camera comes securely packaged and ready to operate after a quick battery charge. I did have a bit of trouble getting the owner's manual to download. It went fine on my iPad, but when I tried to get a backup copy to my laptop, I received an error number that then took me to a 'tech chat' option. Sadly, that was a connection to some scammers (in my opinion) who tried to sell me some very expensive and unnecessary security. They told untruths and pressured me a lot. Arlo needs to know this and the bad impression of the Arlo company they conveyed. The camera itself, though is fine and gives clear images. Just a warning here for folks who might run into the same situation.",,1383,359,https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Pro-Spotlight-Camera-Wire-Free/dp/B08L75YWZK/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=cheap+wireless+security+cameras&qid=1640229170&sr=8-6

Video quality doesn’t seem to be much better than the cheap wyze cam I replaced with this blink, even after adjusting to “best” quality. Love that it’s wireless and no longer have a 9 foot cable hanging on my wall. App is pretty intuitive. Alexa integration is great. Had an issue with the first cam, customer service was very helpful.","I just want to say for all the people that crap on these cameras, these cameras are amazing. They do the job. They are sturdy. They last through snow, wind, rain, and sun. They have amazing low light vision. Clear pictures. And a great setup to last two years on double AAs. And for those who need them to last longer buy the adapter to plug them in. It's stupid how these people come and review these as if they were 5000 dollar security set ups. These are worth it and a great value.",,"We are happy with our blink indoor cameras. It being wireless, light, and battery powered made it easy to install. The motion detection feature allows you to choose sections of the room you want monitored. The night vision is provides good quality captures and we were surprised the battery life is rated for two years. However, please keep in mind that it could change base on how much you use the live view, how often it triggers to record, how long the duration of recording, is set to, and if your wifi signaling is bad.Note: if you have a large area or areas with lots of obstructions (i.e. cement, brick, steel, and aluminum) walls you may want to have a wifi meshed network to extend you wifi network pass these obstructions. We have the Google Nest Wifi system. Also, the blink camera must connect to the sync module via low frequency radio (LFR). Because of this, the camera must be within distance of the sync module. This is separate from your home wifi network. My suggestion is to get another syn-module if you run into issues where your single sync-module cannot cover all camera areas.","The all-new Blink Indoor – wireless, HD security camera appears to be a good product at a reasonable price. I bought a set of three that came with a Sync module. I believe up to 10 devices can be connected wirelessly to the Sync module that communicates using your home wifi. I was able to easily set up the camera using the Blink app on an iPhone. in addition, I was able to link to Alexa using my Amazon Prime account. This helped to view the camera on the Echo View screen using Alexa voice command such as, ""Alexa, show Living Room.""I understand that Lithium AA batteries (supplied with the camera) would last for two years. Also, there is a USB-C port to power the camera, although no cable or USB charging block is provided.The camera comes with a small mountong bracket and screws for wall or ceiling mounting.15 day trial for storing in the cloud is free and after that the subscription is $3/month per camera or $10/month for all cameras. However, the Sync module has an USB post and a low profile USB thumb drive upto 256 GB may be used to store video clips in MP4 format.My only complaint is that a detailed User's Manual explaining all these should be included instead of finding at Blink support website.",13123,512,https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Indoor-Wireless-Security-Camera-5cam/dp/B07X13N8MY/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=cheap+wireless+security+cameras&qid=1640229170&sr=8-9

Fast loading. Excellent quality.,So Easy an Old Man Did It,Nice PTZ security camera,Great Value for a fine product,Fair security camera for a great price.,"I have to say that I am very impressed with the picture quality. I got the 1920 upgraded version, and not only that the quality is great but it also loads super fast and without any delays. It connected quickly to my network. The camera itself is made well, and it feels quite durable/premium. I like how it looks and I love that I am able to maneuver it. There are tons of other options associated with it, but I’m not really using them much. I do recommend this camera.","First impressions are the opening gateway. What do I mean? The beautiful box and shipping package done with such care reveals the great quality that followed. Well written in perfect English, the legible instruction book is printed on quality paper and organized clearly delineating very easy instructions on setting up the camera on your Android or iPhone phone and/or computers, the images the camera provides in dark stormy or beautiful days or nights of moonlight shadows moving across your property - you will see and hear what is there and you'll command by your voice what you want ""Stop and Unfold yourself!"" ""Hamlet"" Act One scene 1 or tell your kids to bring the ball inside and get out of the rain. This camera works with WiFi signal or wired direct into your router. The power comes from a supplied transformer plugged into any household outlet. The night time viewing is so ample because of the modern electrical engineering design. The carapace or outside cover is all waterproof and safe for exposure but also works, sleekly inside. We found it does not have to be screwed into a wall but can rest on a desk or shelf and pointed at the subject area. We strongly recommend this product after years of installing many cameras in commercial buildings and in residential properties, our experience is this camera is a next evolution in easy DIY (do it yourself) security products. On Amazon we found drill bit for the outside install under our roof eve. My brainy friend Mario really liked how easy it was to install on his iPhone and set-up on the desk-top computer. He gives a 4 Star rating but I give it an extra star because I can now see far down the road for the UPS Driver and the USPS letter carrier delivering our stuff. This company Anran, will sell millions of these, I give it 5 Stars.","Under current difficult time, it is important to keep your family safe. That is reason I purchased quite a lot of security cameras. However a simple camera that can track automatically is needed. This PTZ security camera is the one I am looking for. I was attracted by its compact size. Tested and worked perfectly. It seems easy to install though I don’t have time to place on the wall. Will do during the Thanksgiving and share later.","This 2 Megapixel outdoor security camera is one awesome low-cost device. It features superb 1080P daylight full color, full motion video with variable framerate. The low light/ night vision is outstanding. It offers the convenience of 2.4Ghz WiFi connectivity that is easy to setup wirelessly from your phone in adhock mode. Once connected locally to your phone, you perform a very basic setup to direct the camera to your 2.4Ghz access point router. Once the camera is attached to your own 2.4Ghz network using your SSID and security credentials you simply enter the UID (each camera has a unique unit ID) into CamHi or Hip2P software. The Anran software will find the camera /add it to your list of viewable devices. I cannot speak for apple IOS but for Android the CAMHi application is easy to use, stable and works well. Same deal with the Windows 10 compatible Hip2P client. In my case I do not have time to set around watching a security camera. I also do not have time to sift through video files if I think I had something happing on one of my properties. This camera has the ability to generate emails. If you have motion detection properly configured the device will send you an email with a video snapshot or video clip of the action which tripped motion detection. If you get an email you had an issue, if you don’t go back fishing! I will mention setting up SMTP protocols for sending emails very from internet provider. The best way to do this is to be sure to use an email address originating from your service provider. For example, if your WiFi AP/router is connected to SPECTRUM be sure you use SPECTRUM SMTP configurations and a SPECTRUM EMAIL account. For security reason most ISP restrict SMTP sourced emails to their own network! By the way there are thousands of cheep, low cost security cameras. Most sort of work OK, they fail or technical support is minimal at best or non-existent. Anran products are low cost to reasonable, they are NOT CHEEP junk. They do have responsive technical support. I own a number of Anran products. As an Engineer I can truly say I find ANRAN camera products are reliable, quality products you can trust.","The camera is fair. It's made of plastic. The way it is designed structurally I find questionable if it truly is up against weather environment with the plastic designs and few (speaker) holes it has around. When unboxing the package for the two wires (AC/Ethernet) there is a clear cut for something else that was once there. I suspect it's probably further CCTV options. I don't know why the cut was done to begin with but it is there and exposed. Camera feedback and general quality is fair as well for the price you pay. The PC software and phone app are two entirely different beasts with bad UI navigation. Everything you want and need is there but it is a tedious task of setting it up the way you want it to be. I've had two interruptions from the phone app where it refused to pick up the camera and yet everywhere else was accessible. I don't know what went wrong regarding that but in the end the 'fix' was just restarting the camera. There are plenty of quirks that are not accessible to the normal phone app user. One major difference that I can recall being the software allows to set up FOUR detection areas while the phone app allows only one. This was something I needed and the software can be a bit iffy. It requires patience, with the UI navigation being -all over the place-. For the price you pay, it's fair. I can give a proper recommendation but be warned you will need an actual computer for further options unless you just want the bare minimum.After thinking of it I changed my review from 4 to 5 where I will likely buy this product again for additional security. If I have any future issues I may change it appropriately. I think it will handle the Texas heat well.",291,124,https://www.amazon.com/Tracking%E3%80%91-ANRAN-Surveillance-Waterproof-Detection/dp/B06XQ5P3VP/ref=sxin_13_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?cv_ct_cx=cheap+wireless+security+cameras&keywords=cheap+wireless+security+cameras&pd_rd_i=B06XQ5P3VP&pd_rd_r=0970adc0-c02b-4071-b54c-06169617869e&pd_rd_w=0WIhc&pd_rd_wg=QMMc8&pf_rd_p=4ad71b32-b810-4124-8735-d02a39478d0c&pf_rd_r=51PVDTWQFM09166W6HT3&qid=1640229170&sr=1-5-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExWDdUNEtWTklRUlcwJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjk0MjEyM01aMkZKVFI1UlJYOSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNzgwMjkyMVIzNVlaRzM2MVlGUiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX3NlYXJjaF90aGVtYXRpYyZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

Even at night when all the lights are off, the images come out crisp and clear!-Motion sensor is great! Unlike some other cameras where you define a blob of the areas you need, this app gives you a 5x5 grid you can just choose to detect instead of having to fine tune the edges, so it's quite easy to change to ignore areas you don't need that have a higher traffic.-App is well made and easy to navigate! I had no problems setting up the camera at all through the app, the camera has a time and date stamp as well, and it's possible to sort through the videos it took by date, and even narrow it down by type (options are Motion, Sound, and Human shape).-Lens is slightly fish-eye so it has a great coverage, more than I thought it would! Just a small camera covers my whole living room area with basically not much blind spots!Cons:-Another App! Might not be a con for you, but I have a smart home with tons of apps, so it's a tiny hassle to have to add another app instead of using a camera that already works with one of my other apps, but for the much cheaper price of a great camera, it's not too much of a bother in exchange. It's also a well made app so I don't have too much complaints about it!","Received the home pro camera on time, App download and camera setup – took me a while to figure out it only works with 2.4G wifi network, the APP video instruction helps. I use it keep an eye on my cat when I am not at home, talk through the camera via the app on my phone and tablet. I am impressed by blurams APP, the notifications are marked as 3 different types, sound, human and motion, which is very helpful when I search on the video clips. The sound and video quality meet my expectation. Had in use for about a week, hopefully it will continue to work well.","Wow, I cannot say enough good things about this camera! First, it was super simple to set up. Anyone who knows me also knows I have worse than horrible luck with technology. This worked perfectly. The picture is great quality and I even got notifications when someone/something moved in front of the camera or made a loud noise.We bought this to see what our teenager was up to while we were gone. It was fairly easy to hide although he found it on day 3. Lol it worked great. And even better, I found out I have a great kid!! (Admittedly I already knew that last part but I was a teenager once too...🤣)Overall, I would highly recommend this camera. It's priced great, great video quality and the app works perfectly. The only thing you need is a MICRO SD card and to download the app.","Fantastic camera, regardless of the price! Night vision mode is very good. I love it. Image quality is very good. It looks to me like 1080p HD video. On my network it streams in full motion at a nice high frame rate. There's none of the jerky low frame rate video that I get from some of my other cameras. Color reproduction is quite good. incredibly easy setup. You just install the app on your phone, plug the camera in, push a button on the back, and then point the camera at a QR code the displays on your phone. Then you are prompted to enter the password for your wifi, and that's it. It literally takes 1 minute to set up, with no messing around with firewalls, routers, ports, etc. It's an absolute breeze.The motiion detection is simple and reliable. An optional push notification is sent to your phone. And you can go into the app and watch the recording. highly recommended this product！！","We are doing foster care for a young sibling group of three and have been frustrated trying to figure out what is happening some of the times. The wife and 17yo daughter have the phone app on their phones. This is a little too techy for me but they can pull up video and within about 5 minutes figure out who the culprit is. Unfortunately, there is a free 1 month introductory service that ran out the day when we could have used it most. There was no warning until the service stopped but we upped the subscription for a year and things are back under control. The footage is also helpful for showing the culprit why they are being punished.",1716,295,https://www.amazon.com/blurams-Security-Recognition-Talk%EF%BC%8CSiren-Detection/dp/B07NS5DPX2/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=cheap+wireless+security+cameras&qid=1640229170&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExWDdUNEtWTklRUlcwJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDUxOTE1MVJaNjJJNDVFNUhEWSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzQ2Mzk3MzVXOUNKMEhMWlpLRyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

Luckily I had spares. Nothing on the box would tell you.Edit: After only leaving my previous single star review (no complaints to Mfg or Amazon), the Mfg customer service rep reached out to me and asked if I wanted to get replacement power adapters. I said I did and just a few days later a bag arrived with a full set of 120V/12V adapters.So, in addition to a pretty decent low budget security camera system, their customer service ranks up towards the top too! They obviously read their reviews and are willing to act on them without a lot of drama. Hard to find in this day and time.The Camera system itself is pre-paired, so all you need is power and a phone to set-up around the house. I can't connect it directly to my TV HDMI yet (older LCD so unsupported mode) but a borrowed VGA cable let me run it to set up emails and all the recording parameters (can't access the set-up from phone or PC that I can figure out).Carmeras have good daytime and respectable night vision. I did augment the IR with a flood and it's actually better vision at night than daytime!!! Zoom is a little dodgy but using the focus helps. PTZ camera are good and I love the rover mode.Like I said... it's a good option for a budget system. A lot better than my previous Foscam set-up and cheaper overall since you have an annual cost to record that isn't here!I'm happy with it and would recommend it to others!","The cameras and the sound is very good. It picks up talking from probably 30’ away with your back to the camera. The night vision is pretty good. I only have issues when it is changing from dusk to dark. The smart vision setting goes back and forth for a about half an hour. It isn’t a deal breaker. The only problem is if you want to depend on the human sensors to notify you of movement. If it’s windy and something like a tree or a box blows around it will detect it. If a car drives by my house, it will detect it. It has also picked up on moths flying at the camera at night and shadows moving on the wall. I turned off the sensor down to minimum on one camera cause it went off too much. Set up to my phone and iPad perfectly so I can view the cameras from anywhere. I have and would recommend these to people on a budget that wants security without a subscription to a company. I also set the system up myself so I saved money on installation.","The Hiseeu Wireless Security Camera System was easy to setup and connect to my phone for remote viewing from the EseeCloud app. It has high quality 3MP images. The PTZ Cameras are easy to control from the phone app. I enjoy being able to view from front and back yards with these PTZ cameras. The 2-way audio is amazing and the speakers on the PTZ cameras are loud (and louder than the Bullet Cameras). I like the convenience of being able to have a 2-way conversation using the cameras and the phone app. The NVR is easy to setup to send Motion Alerts to the phone app. The system is Plug&Play and I have it saving videos 24/7 (as this is nicely set as the default setting). I like how the Wireless IP addresses of the cameras are already setup to the NVR unit. The inner cardboard box arrived open, but I believe that's because the seller setup the addresses of the cameras to the NVR ahead of time (pre-installed). It was easy to screw the cameras above my doors and under the eaves of our house. Some of the cameras are over 100 feet from the NVR unit with strong signals. I highly recommend this Security Camera System because it has quality images, has a working phone app, has 2-way audio, is Plug and Play, and is easy to install onto walls.","We have pretty janky, rural internet that maxes out at 1 Mbps upload speed. This system works great!! I bought 4 extra cameras (2ptz and 2 fixed) and adding them is pretty simple. Be careful if you want the ones that match the kit as they're described as 2k instead of 3mp. The cameras described as 3mp are different looking.... The motion detection isn't the best but easily turned on and off in the app so I'm happy with it!I would buy again and have already recommended to friends and family!","A very ""plug and play"" system: I got all the cameras out and plugged them into the wall. I hooked the box up to an old vizio tv with the provided hdmi. All cameras connected withing a few seconds except ""camera 1"". I just had a blank screen for that one (a white screen with the hiseeu logo). I played with the settings for a bit, where I found by right clicking on the screen I could left click on ""wireless add"". I left it in this mode for perhaps 5 minutes where it found and auto added the camera.A bit more playing around and I got it to only record during motion detection. Motion detect is very sensitive, its autumn here and a few leaves blowing will set it off. I'm fine with this.Night vision is great, it does a good black and white. I don't like that the cameras all glow red during this mode, but I understand the necessity.PZT mode will allow you to pivot the two cameras that have this function. Use ""speed"" in this mode to adjust how far the camera moves per -up-down-left-right- click you do on the arrows. A speed of 1 will barely move the camera, 8 will move it alot. Knowing this can help set the camera up to just the right spot. Finding the best spots, you can select a ""preset"" number of 1 or higher and hit ""store"", this allows you to quick select a ""preset"" number and hit ""go to"" to quickly scan to the saved spots.Zoom doesn't appear to work on any of my cameras.For an easy and small power extension cord to the cameras, I bought and tested: ""Vanxse CCTV 10m(30ft) 2.1x5.5mm Dc 12v Power Extension Cable for CCTV Security Cameras IP Camera Dvr Standalone"". These seem to work well, and will extend 30 foot per cord.Signal is great. I can't seem to reach the wireless range of my cameras within my yard. I have the box set up with several walls between my farthest camera, perhaps 100 feet from the box to the camera. The signal indicator on the screen says 3 bars. The furthest camera is a Ptz kind, and it does seem to respond slower to pan than the camera that is only 30 feet away.Overall a great system, I ordered 1 ptz camera and a few extension cords so that I can have an overview cam from my backyard tree, will try to update review once is installed.",260,87,https://www.amazon.com/Hiseeu-Wireless-Security-Cameras-Waterproof/dp/B08LD975F3/ref=sxin_13_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?cv_ct_cx=cheap+wireless+security+cameras&keywords=cheap+wireless+security+cameras&pd_rd_i=B08LD975F3&pd_rd_r=0970adc0-c02b-4071-b54c-06169617869e&pd_rd_w=0WIhc&pd_rd_wg=QMMc8&pf_rd_p=4ad71b32-b810-4124-8735-d02a39478d0c&pf_rd_r=51PVDTWQFM09166W6HT3&qid=1640229170&sr=1-2-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&psc=1&smid=AO9MIPGVNFFEB&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExWDdUNEtWTklRUlcwJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjk0MjEyM01aMkZKVFI1UlJYOSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTkwOTY4MUJCQktRRk5aWUpDRiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX3NlYXJjaF90aGVtYXRpYyZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

Here is the reason why...,"* Using this on my patio to watch into the backyard. During the day if kids playing there or in the evening/night for deers.* Simple setup. The app is very simple to get the camera ready. You need to connect the app to Wi-Fi once and add the camera to that after that you can access it from anywhere. You need a regular 2.4 GHz wifi connection for this. I tried connecting to my router wifi which is default to 5GHz and it does not get the camera setup then I moved that to my mesh network setup which is 2,4 GHz it took 2 mins t setup the camera and another 2-3 min to upgrade the firmware on cam.* Solar panel looks well made and the screen is not reflective.* App is very well made and a lot of features. 4+ rating on the Google play store.* Camera has its own battery and can work without a panel also once charged.

I did not mount it yet as I moving it around the patio.* Solar panel cord to camera is around 10 ft or may be more.",,"We have an area in front of our garage that we cannot drill through so this solar powered camera works great. We installed in on a post that sticks out from our garage and where it's at, it gets sun all day long, no matter what time of day. We were able to angle the camera just right that we would not only get in front of our house but the only neighbor that we have too. We're able to see who turns the corner and can clearly see license plate numbers whether it's day or night. We live in a condo complex and this thing has some great night vision. We were having some issues with people attempting to break into cars and the one camera we do have that requires it to be plugged in, the angle of it does not get plate numbers, just the cars and the people attempting to break in. With this camera, I'm able to get the angle that we need and can clearly see license plate numbers either in the front or the back. This was really easy to install and using the app is just as easy. We can take clear pictures while watching the playback and when it comes to videos, we're able to play, pause and even download them. The picture quality during the day is very clear but what surprised me was the clarity of the night vision. There's no blur or grainy looking picture or video. Has really come in handy on several occasions and just makes it easier because the charge that it gets from the sun has kept the power on this camera going.",,"Absolutely recommend this product! Truly works on SOLAR power, easy to install! No more power provision needed.So I live in a townhome setting and always wanted a security camera.... The cost of security camera was never an issue but the installation cost to provision the power to the camera was way more than the cost of the camera itself! (since I don't really have power outlets outside close enough for where I wanted to install it)This one solved the power problem completely! This thing is in theory truly wireless and the SOLAR panel does a very good job of keeping this powered on 24x7!I have had it up and running for over a week and half now and the battery charges with the SOLAR panel very well! (Yes, even on Gloomy, rainy cloudy days)I was a little worried about Winter if the panel was covered with SNOW, but someone answered a question that they had snow on it for over 6 days and the camera continued working, but the way I installed the solar panel (slant), the snow will not be able to accumulate. (but lets see what happens in Winter)Literally took 15 - 20 minutes start to end to set up and and install!Love the fact that you can switch from SD to HD (high Definition color) if you like... and the best part is it has Voice and Video!!! It gives you a live view and audio with in 10 to 15 seconds of opening the app... (keep it mind, it does take some time to get a live feed... its not instant the moment you open the app and I was expecting this delay because it is over IP) some may find this to be a problem, but for me it is not!

My main complaint is re: the motion detection, but that's likely more of a situational thing. We have a lot of bears and other wildlife around, and since the camera focuses on person detection, it only captures them if the motion detection is turned up to its highest sensitivity - which drains the battery faster. The battery life has been great so far, though. No regrets, and I'll definitely stick to Eufy cameras moving forward!","This is the best video doorbell I have ever owned.

Great Product.,"""3TB HDD Pre-Instal - Hiseeu Wireless Security Camera System, 8CH 1080P NVR 4Pcs Outdoor/Indoor WiFi Surveillance Camera with Night Vision, Waterproof, Motion Alert, Remote Access"" model WXKIT-8HB611-1T.**I will only try to point out some things not discussed in the description andFirst this is an EIGHT CAMERA system so don't be confused by the ""4pcs"" in the description.Second, I sent an email question to their customer service and received a response in less then 24hrs - VERY GOOD.Third, this is a Standalone system running Linux which gets rid of the BLOATWARE/SNIFFING of Windows and Chrome, etc. 'nuf said on my opinions of Goggle and Microsoft.Second, BUY the system with ALL the cameras (8 max) so that you have 'Spares"" bought cheap as a 'kit.' I have used 6 in my system to date. The Camera Software has display settings for 8 camera windows, 6, 4, and so on.Third, the Cameras housing, adjustment arm and base are 'cast metal' (not plastic) very well made. I specifically chose ones with good 'hoods' as several of my units would be hit by the sun and typically would bleach out the image.Forth, the camera's field of view is very good and clarity range is as far as it shows. There is no flutter in the images after 4 months installed. The automatic 'white balance' is the best I have seen on NUMEROUS systems including Commercial versions. This comes into play when it goes B/W for night vision. On that note, there is a 'electric eye' on the front that actually switches the Camera mode too which does NOT rely on software to make that determination and uses decades old established 'eye' tech for delay - i.e. doesn't switch back & forth and does not get effected by passing headlights etc. This is the BEST manner in my opinion and you can actually HEAR the switch when you cover the eye with your finger!Fifth, the NIGHT VISION of the camera is exceptional for a non-commercial unit. It uses THREE ""infra-red illuminator"" LEDs (shown in picture) that are very strong (bottom ""led"" is actually the electric eye). The 65 feet is correctly advertised. However there is a hotspot because the LEDs are not shining 'spread out' as far as camera's field of view. This is an issue with ALL infra-red Iluminators as the Infra-red light is such a small band of light energy - that's why your TV remote does not work from a distance or if you don't point it at the TV when your batteries are low. If you need to see further or wider, you will need to invest in separate ACTUAL Infra-Red Iluminators and place them as needed. Note that I have overlapping cameras and each 'see' the others Infra-Red spots.Sixth, Make a CAMERA MAP and plot locations as well as which camera goes where. The system comes FULLY SET UP however, having done this before, I plugged in the entire system on a table, started it up and determined which cameras were 1-8 and LABELED them. Then made sure to put them in the order I wanted them DISPLAYED so when turned it all on, it was only the matter of alignment. I have three in one location alone giving over 180 degree coverage. Those are 150ft away from the base unit and still have a SOLID 3 of 4 bars wifi.Last, I did not need any internet connections (etc.) so have no input there.PS. the noise is typical of just a Hard Drive head indexing and is not loud but it will transfers through its cabinet to a hard surface and becomes a 'sounding board' making it out to be louder than it actually is, which you can fix by putting some soft 'feet' on it. The intermittent indexing does make sleeping around it a little funny. The best step would be to offer SSD when the prices come down as they are noiseless and have a better longevity in a constant ""write"" hard derive scenario such as this.","So, let's review, right?Well, when I bought it, of course the price was right, but I was worried that It was on the cheap side, and that it might reflect in the quality. The answer is NO. This was well worth the value. After 2 years, still working just fine.Now, Let's talk about it.Basically, it's pretty easy. Unwrap everything. Grab a network cable, a power strip, and a HDMI or VGA monitor.Once you have those things, plug it all in. DVR to the network, power and HDMI/VGa and a mouse (included but crap), and the cameras all in to the power strip. Turn it all on at once.When everything is on, the cameras should already show up on the screen in a grid. You have to set a password (make it easy, no keyboard). Then walk through the Wizard. Set the time, give it an IP or DHCP (easy instructions included)**. When it says ONLINE, you are done. You can tweak it anyway you want, but honestly, that's about it.There's also a QR code that it displays to download the app for mobile access, and there is one that connects the DVR to your phone. I dowloaded the iPhone app, then clicked 'add DVR' then pointed my phone to the QR code... and in about 5 seconds, the phone showed my cameras.** If you have a router that supports uPNP, use it. It will make things easier.The reason I am posting a review now is because of a recent issue I had. I came home one night to find the DVR had been stuck in a reboot. It would load the startup screen, then reboot. After an EMAIL to their SUPPORT, I was given some options to reset a setting, reboot, and try again. This didn't work, so they sent me a new firmware. That corrected the problem, and I was back online.In many cases, a company would simply tell me that 2 years was over-warranty. I really appreciated that they were able to provide support.I should mention, they do not speak fluent english, so there was a little assumption and muddling I had to go through to understand some of the instructions, but overall. Very impressed.","I ordered this system last year and to my shame it sat in the box till now. I've had a lot of time to do my pet projects and this was one of them. So finally I got it out and after reading reviews of how wireless camera systems were difficult to setup I was dreading the fight. However, no fighting needed. I hooked it up to the tv and plugged it into 120VAC. I plugged in the cameras to 120VAC in different parts of my house in window locations. I then turned on my tv and switched to the HDMI port of the Control Unit of the system. Once again to my surprise I saw my screen divided into squares for each camera powered up. I didn't fight with it at all! Apparently the system is automatically keyed to recognize its cameras and any extra cameras you try connect to the system must be wired. It is still early in my installation and I am trying things out yet. I ran an ethernet cable to the Control Unit and will be trying out accessing from my phone and computer. It looks like you can manually access it over the internet if you know the IP Address and ports of cameras or you can download the software app and use the software to access cameras and schedule recording. I would recommend this system.","I purchased this system recently for my property,At first I was a little hesitant buying a system off Amazon, but then did my due diligence research on the system and Hiseeu as well as tried asking some pre-sale questions to their support to see how efficient support really was. (They did a great job of answering questions)I have been pleasantly surprised with the system as a whole.Setup was very easy as the cameras come preloaded to match the system. (I encourage a new buyer to setup all of the cameras and system in one room first before installing them, This will allow you to identify camera 1 thru 8; although the cameras can be easily reassigned)Once setup, the Admin Menu is pretty easy to understand and work with, so no difficulties there. The viewing “Phone App’ works well, with sharp images that I can now view when I’m away from the house.All in All, I recently had a 900.00 System that I used, and I have found the Hiseeu system is practically the same and for 1\2 the money,I will say though, that I will come back after a month of operation and either update this review or add a new one so I can comment on the stability and connectivity of the System.Note to Potential Buyers:Read the Product description, Hiseeu offers an additional 8% off if you email them for a code before the sale, To me; that was the final item that had me land on them for a product.",228,53,https://www.amazon.com/HisEEu-Wireless-Security-Surveillance-Pre-Install/dp/B0757FLCRZ/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=cheap+wireless+security+cameras&qid=1640229170&sr=8-18

It is easy to set up and use. The picture quality is good (HD quality or a little better). Support by email is good. However, upon ""motion detection"" the receipt of the notification email with pictures posted to my Vosker account may arrive within 30 seconds or several hours. I find this troubling considering this is a LTE (AT&T, Verizon) based security camera. I have 5x5 signal reception (strongest). This issue may be a problem with the volume of cellular traffic between the Vosker servers and my email account. I would expect Vosker to monitor the traffic and adjust the network and routing. Vosker management is free to respond to my comment. For a top quality security camera like the V200 this should not happen.","We are building a house out in the country that is over an hour drive one way from our house. We wanted to be able to keep an eye on the construction process to know when it would be worth our time to drive up to the site and back. From my research, I determined the best type of camera was one that had solar charging capabilities and also cellular built-in in order to send me photos when there was activity. So I bought this camera. I played around with it for over a month at my home in order to get a sense of how the camera worked and which settings were the best for me. The camera is super easy to activate and you get one month free of the elite plan, which is unlimited photos. I ended up opting to continue this plan after the one month free trial period. For $20 a month I can get as many photos as I want sent to me and 40 photos upgraded to high DEF if requested. Once I had a good feel of how the camera and the associated app worked, we drove up to the construction site and found a tree that pointed toward the site that we felt had a good point of view. I’m glad I played around with this at home first so I didn’t have to fool around with it when we were setting it up. I love the VOSKER app and set the camera to send me photos every two hours. This camera is working wonderfully and since it’s been installed it has maintain 100% battery power through the solar panel. It helps that we have a cell tower on a mountain above our build side which gives a 5 x 5 signal. The night vision took a photo of a couple deer walking around the construction site at 1 AM from 50 feet away in complete darkness. We had a person who came to the site and I thought that he worked for our builder but wasn’t sure from the standard definition photos sent so I requested a high def photo and determined that this was the guy I thought it was. The camera is doing everything we hoped it would and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I am thinking that maybe some of the one star reviews came at a time when VOSKER was doing a software upgrade that caused people issues. That is partly the reason why I wanted to do a review. I couldn’t be more thrilled with my purchase.",I love this camera and phone app!! I use it as my primary driveway camera system. It never fails to alert me of visitors when I am at home or away.

I purchased 2 additional Firstrend 1080P cameras to fully cover the outside of my home for $65 each. Firstrend also recommended a Wifi Signal Booster 2.4 Ghz 4W 802.11 Signal Extender for $30.99 to extend the range on the antenna that I was having problems with intermittent signal coverage.The paperwork initially provided was too little and very confusing. I had a few calls with Daisy and she was wonderful, helped greatly, and was very pleasant. Recently, Daisy sent me a newly published User Manual (User Manual Of Firstrend Wireless Camera System-888-806-1588.pdf) which is written in much better English, covered more topics, and solved the overall issue that so many buyers complained about in earlier reviews.The hardware seems to be made really well and sturdy. I had an issue with the antenna connection on one of the cameras and Daisy replaced the camera quickly and the new unit worked great. I read in the original instructions that you needed to tighten the antenna down tight – just don’t tighten it too tightly or you may strip the treads - this may have been partly my fault do to the way the instructions were written.The picture quality is very good in both the day and at night. The power cord on the camera is roughly 9’ in length and depending on placement getting electrical outlets to the cameras can be challenging depending on your experience level. If you use a booster to improve the Wifi signal, the cord on the booster is only a little over 3’ so when I ran electric to for those units I put in a double box with an exterior bubble cover. I also used the same 2-gang weatherproof box when I put 2 cameras in close proximity to each other. Firstrend advises to put cameras at least 5’ from each other.Make sure that the cameras are all connected and working before you install them outside on your house. Adding a camera or two isn’t difficult as long as you have the channels on the NVR to support them. Daisy indicated that the 2 Terabyte hard drive in the NVR that I purchased would record up to 8 Channels/Cameras for 2 weeks automatically and then overwrite the disk starting from the oldest files.Wifi connectivity is absolutely critical. It took me awhile to get workable locations determined on a couple of cameras so that signal issue was consistently strong. What I found was that moving the camera to the end of a gutter or on the other camera to the top of a 7’ fence away from the house itself provided a strong signal without a booster. A good strong signal was obtained on the other camera that would go on and off at times by using the recommended booster.I've attached a few photos that I took during the installation. The TV screen shot shows a typical view while monitoring the cameras and was taken at night while it was raining.Bottom line – I didn’t find it extremely simple to install but if you take your time and do it right it is not a difficult system to install and you will have a first class camera system that will protect you and your home which is what all purchasers are striving for. I strongly recommend this product.","So this is my first security system. When you first start looking for your system, you looking for all the bells and whistles: I want to be able to see all area's of my house, I want to record it, I want to zoom in and talk through it and have them be able to talk back..... Well at least that's what I wanted. I work from home, in the basement and wanted to know what was going outside of my dungeon while I work. Do I really need to get up to check who's at the door? Why is the house quiet, are the kids dead? But what system would work best for me? I have wanted one for years but never followed through because I did not want to run video cords from each camera all the way to the basement, Heeeeell no. So Wireless, yes please! All they need is power plugged into a normal outlet and then they wirelessly send the video to the NVR (DVR) unit where it is being recorded....at my house, no need to be spending money every month to rent some company's cloud somewhere. No monthly fee! But which one? There were at least 5 different brands that I still had on the table at this point. I went with Firstrend in the end because of all the great review about their customer service. And yes you should use email, as yes you are talking to someone across the world, and yes there is a delay of a day or 2.... BUT, It's worth it! Daisy will work with you to make it right! I had a tall order seeing as how my NVR was going to be receiving signals from a basement over a 2,500sq house in the suburbs of Ohio. Some cameras worked great right out of the box. Some cameras worked great sometimes but would lose the signal after a few hours and then I would have to unplug them and plug them back in to make them work again. and 1 camera was just a dud and could not get further than the room I had the NVR in. But, Firstrend Customer Service to the rescue! We tried a few different troubleshooting options, and after those possibilities were removed I was sent 2 wireless boosters to apply to the cameras losing the signal, and a replacement for the camera that was a dud. No forms, no hassle, just what was your amazon order number, what address to send them to, done, express mail, Return anything, naw, don't worry about it! YES! Thank you for making this easy! and in the end I have a working system that I am happy with. I would suggest getting the 4 camera system to try it out and you can always acquire more cameras later. There is Motion Sensing tech on the cameras but I have not found the sweet spot on the sensitivity scale to make it text my phone for kids running with sticks at each other in he driveway but ignore differences in tree shadows, however I think that might be a difficult task for any system. The NVR interface and the App interface are decent, not great, not crap, but I'm happy with it. My next step is to try and share the app to my wife's phone so we both have access, but I know there is some trick to it, as the company is trying to protect you from hackers. But it can be done. I also thought I would like the scheduled recordings for some of the time and then just motion alerts for the rest of the time, but so far I have just stayed with Record everything all the time and no alerts. Sure, it won't protect me from invading clowns spun out on bath salts as they trigger the motion sensor, but better than being texted every 5 mins that the flies/mosquitos are always checking out the camera's built in red light for night vision. Product, I would give 3-4 starts; but man that customer service making it easy for me to make sure everything actually works and no risk? 5 big a$$ stars!","I'm updating this review today Jan 28, 2020:I've had the system installed and working fine since Oct 2018I wrote the review below soon after we got her up and running without problems.Last month we had some sort of power glitch or unprotected power spike (as noted on the recorded time-stamp of video feed.) Both exterior cameras went on the fritz.Since the unit is just a bit outside out of its 12-month warranty and after a short email exchange with the manufacturer’s representative (Neal) requesting a couple of steps to get the two cameras back online, they, Firstrend have been gracious enough to offer sending me two (2) more exterior cameras which we were not able to repair and get back online.My 15-month experience with this product and the help of their rep. Neal still justifies me giving them 5 stars!Their email help is quick and efficient and their out-of-warranty product support is what's to be expected from a successful company!FIRST REVIEW: ""This review is for the n1080P Wireless Security Camera System, Firstrend 8CH Wireless NVR System with 4pcs 1080P Security IP Camera and 2TB Hard Drive Pre-Installed, 65ft Night Vision and Easy Remote Monitoring. Got it set up in about 5 hours (running extra ethernet cable 65 feet to garage and hanging 5 cameras) and the screen views are excellent! Do spend the few extra bucks and get the 1080p system. Motion sensitivity program algorithms need some work though. Too sensitive, even at the lowest settings. Workaround is to record only during motion activation at select periods of time and eliminate the continual recording (if you don't want to overrun old recordings on your drive or if your drive is not big enough or absent and you only want to get notifications either by email or text) You can record both continually and when motion-activated and then separate files into two folders for easier viewing later or you can record either continually only or motion detection only. One big plus is that all cameras record even though only one camera was motion activated. And they only record for 30 seconds after motion activation, not hours, sucking up your hard drive space. This parameter of recoding time is not adjustable. 1080p picture quality of viewing live shots and recorded shots is EXCELLENT, whether it's on your iPhone or your Windows machine!Daisy, in their service group, is wonderful! She was able to resolve the major two hiccups during the set-up, syncing of extra 5th camera (deleting and adding a new ip address of new camera that didn't come with the new 4 camera system, a simple procedure since everything is menu-driven) and why a black and white picture when should be 1080p color (default of system during low light/night conditions in area where camera was surveilling.) The color came back during daylight :)","So far very pleased with this purchase. Had a situation with ""Motion"" setup. Left Email, less than 24hrs later received a response from Daisy.She addressed all my concerns and supplied me with step by step assistance in getting ""Motion"" feature working. Thank you Daisy.It took me time looking at reviews before I decided on this unit. The clarity of video and playback is very good and now with Motion detection working this is a Great system for my security needs.I hope Firstrend continues its A+ customer service if and when needed by anyone.Love the wireless feature (no ""home run"" cabling needed, but could also be used with Ethernet connection) just power outlet to power cameras.Included with this unit is a mouse, short Ethernet router cable, all necessary hardware to mount cameras with a mounting template, covers for non used camera cable ends, drill for mounting, wrench for adjusting cameras and instruction manual.","This is a nice piece of kit. It is easy to set up, including on your phone. There is a wee bit of a learning curve, and I keep learning things about it, but you can get off the ground and operating quickly.Picture quality is quite good, including in the black and white night vision mode.Figuring out how to save the video and some of the powers of the system are a little confusing. Mastering mouse clicks helps, the system likes slow deliberate mouse clicks! Quick clicks frequently don't work.It will stream to a phone, it will send alerts to the phone. You cannot play back video on the phone without the cloud account (has a monthly fee).You can control the alarms for each camera independently (BIG yay!). Haven't fiddled with it, but it appears you can select sensitivity areas visually on each camera as well. This could be hugely helpful for our front camera that sees cars on the road.A helpful accessory/necessity is power extension cords for the DC cord that goes to each camera. This helps you plug in the camera charger inside somewhere and run a small DC power cord out to where the camera is mounted.All in all, we are quite pleased with this system.",1028,497,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Wireless-Firstrend-Pre-Installed-Auto-Pair/dp/B07KK889QH/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=cobra+security+camera&qid=1640230084&sr=8-18

Purchase different cables.,Awesome Product,Great cameras!  Great price!,"Good cameras, great customer support",great value,"I originally bought these 4 cameras 2 years ago. Within 6 months I had to replace 3 of the cables. They just stopped working. (I have 4 other cameras I have had for over 3 years and never had to buy new cables for them) One of the cameras has shown parts of the screen in purple almost since the beginning. Changing the color settings did not help. At about a year one of the arms just snapped off of one of the cameras. It still works and is held together and hanging from a strap, but at a strange angle because there is no bracket on it or a way to adjust it. The way it broke, would not allow it to be repaired. I was barely touching it and getting ready to adjust it when it snapped. Today I am replacing the 4th cable because it stopped working. I may have just gotten a bad set, but I would not recommend these cameras after what I've been through. The cameras I bought 3 years ago for much less money are still working great and I've never had a problem with them. I rarely give bad reviews, but today was the last straw.After posting my review I was contacted by the company. They sent me 2 brand new cameras to replace the 2 that weren't working correctly. Although I don't recommend using the cables supplied with the cameras, I do recommend the cameras and the company. Do yourself a favor and purchase better cables so you aren't replacing them in a few months. I buy these for all my cameras --> Amcrest 2-Pack 150 Feet Pre-Made All-in-One Siamese BNC Video and Power CCTV Security Camera Cable with Two Female Connectors for 960H & HD-CVI Camera and DVR (SCABLEHD150B-2pack). $25 for 2 and so far they work great. These cameras are very easy to position and adjust. No special tools needed. Just a small Phillips head screwdriver. The cameras supply a clear, color accurate video of whatever area of your yard or home you want to see. I can actually see the fish swimming in my pond. I would love to purchase the latest version ZOSI makes, but not in the budget at the moment. If banks, stores, and gas stations had these cameras, you could actually see and identify thieves instead of just seeing blurry figures. Thank you ZOSI for exceptional customer service.","I’ve only unboxed and set these up for testing before the hard install later to come.I bought these to expand my harbor freight cobra 8 channel that only came with 4 cobra cams and expand they did.Now I’m glad it only came with four or I would have never found these. A single cobra cam is $40 these @$25 each is incredible.Of the four photos the lower quality are of course the cobra cams and the much better quality are the new ZOSI cams. I will add more daylight photos soon.Also note worthy, I did test to see if these cams kept their joystick settings after a power outage and they do. These cams appear to be very well built. Comparing them again to the cobras they are almost twice the size, %200 better image, they have twice the IR LEDs and the metal housing gives the impression that they are durable and well made.If the daylight images are just as impressive I’ll be ordering another set.For the price I haven’t found anything about this cam I don’t like.A special note for harbor freight cobra users.Again I did test that these kept their joystick setting after a power outage. To make your life a little simpler I tested every set point on my cobra DVR.Unless you just want to run threw it yourself, do yourself a favor and set both the cameras and you DVR in TVI mode and you’ll be all set.Cobra DVR main menu-camera set up tab-Drop down tab to TVI and saveI ended up changing all cams even the four cobra cams to TVI I found they looked a little better.Awesome productAwesome value","I bought a four pack of these little gems to augment my existing Zmodo home surveillance system. With these cameras, I added three new views (channels) to my home system for a total of seven and replaced one of the original Zmodo cameras. Since installing these Zosi cameras, have definitely taken notice of the sharper, clearer picture, the significantly better night vision and the picture ""stability"" of the cameras which significantly decreases the number of false motion recordings (the brightness of the picture is consistent and does not change suddenly as my Zmodos are prone to doing). As a matter of fact, have purchased another four pack of these cameras as of the writing of this review to replace the three remaining Zmodo cameras and have one as as a spare. Bottom line, these are GREAT little cameras for the money IMHO!",,I have a swann DVR that came in a kit with cameras. One of the cameras stopped working and another was giving problems. I received these zosi cameras and installed. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. The picture is much better day and night than the swann cameras. A great camera for the money. I will eventually replace all the swann cameras with these.,517,145,https://www.amazon.com/ZOSI-Weatherproof-Security-Distance-Aluminum/dp/B00LHK2GN6/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=cobra+security+camera&qid=1640230084&sr=8-20

Everything came as it should and it took me a day to mount and wire up all the camera's. It took me another few hours just to get all the angles right and to move one to different location. Once I had it up and running it took me only a little bit to figure out how to get it running and recording. The main unit is about a 12"" x 12"" and everything hooks up nice. It comes with a 1Terabite drive and was easy to get formatted and recording. One thing I would say to all, is let it keep the default image resolution settings. If you try to go higher than the camera's will handle, it will cause it to reboot and start all over. I hooked this up to a older TV with the HDMI connection and it stays on at all times right above my computer desk.My real worry was the quality of the camera's. Truthfully I don't think they are 720p camera's myself. If you try to make the image large the image is a bit blurry and unstable. Not the kind of unstable that would make it not be usable but if you have watched a 720p video it's a lot better than this. But that aside, the quality is much better than the older style systems you used to get, and for the money it's worth it. The biggest plus to this system is the night vision. This to me is where this system really shines. The camera goes Black and White when it gets too dark and the images are not awesome, but better than anything I have seen on any of my work systems. They really do show about 65 feet in the pitch dark and though it is a bit grainy you can still make out anything moving out there. I can even see my dog when he goes out to do his thing : pThe peace of mind from having this system is worth every penny. We had some prowlers before we got this messing with our water lines and this is why we purchased this unit. If they ever come back, their gonna get a nice ride and three meals and a cot.Also just a helping hint. The joints to the camera's are sturdy, but if you try to tighten the locking clamp by twisting the camera body you will break the joint. So don't be tempted. Get a pair of Channel Locks and hold the camera and then tighten the lock ring, not super tight but snug. You can thank me later : )","I ordered this system. It arrived super fast and communication with the vendor has been excellent. My plan was to power up the system on the kitchen table and let it run for 4 or 5 days to become familiar with it and verify that it works. I figured being Amazon I could send it back if it didn't live up to expectations. So far, so good.I have been running this system in one configuration or another for more than two months now and have not regretted the purchase. The quality and software capabilities far exceed my expectations at this price point. My only complaint on it so far is the remote app for android. My problems with it are outlined below. Since I am not that interested in remote viewing this is not an issue for me.I have NOT been given a discount for this equipment as some reviewers so the comments below are strictly my own.1-4-17Received the system and wired everything except WIFI and video out. Everything worked well on initial power up. Easy setup with the Wizard. Good clear image for each camera. As night approached and the lights turned off I checked night vision. I don't know what it will do for long distance but in the house in total darkness, 15 feet away I could easily see a person move and what they were wearing. I could not make out details of the face.1-5-17I let system run all night and recording worked fine. Today I opened the DVR to see how it was built.The hard drive is a Toshiba 1 TB 6 GB/s SATA drive. My plan is to install a larger drive so that when we are on vacation we can have two weeks of saved video. I can then use this drive as a backup drive in my server.There is a small cooling fan on the left as you are looking at the front of the unit. There is a good size heat sink on the main chip. I plan to install the DVR on its side so the fan should be up with space on bottom ( right side of unit ) to assure air flow.There are three USB connectors. One on the front of the DVR and two on the back. A mouse comes with the system. I tested it with a wireless mouse but it would not work because you couldn't load a driver for it. The two other USB ports can be used for a backup drive and a wireless dongle.There is also an RJ45 LAN port on the back. I plugged a Cisco bridge into it to connect to my wireless LAN. Entered the password and connected with no issues. I ended up running an Ethernet cable from the RJ45 port to my router. I had some issues getting the remote access app to work with wireless. Not sure if that was the reason.Also a BNC video out connector. Not tested yet but my plan is to run this to my video distribution system so that I can view the cameras on any TV in the house.I had an issue with one of the indoor cameras. I moved the camera on its gimbal mount too far and some of the silicone tubes popped out. My error for moving it so much. I attempted to put them back but they would not stay in place and there was no way to get a dab of glue in there. Then I read the camera instructions ( yes, I should have done that first ) and learned that you can disassemble the camera to mount it to the ceiling. Now I can re glue the silicone pieces. One helpful point is that the instructions say to unscrew the bottom part of the mount. I grabbed the two pieces to unscrew and they would not budge. The trick I learned was hold the two parts very gently and wiggle them in a counterclockwise motion.1-7-17I set a fixed IP address on the DVR and when I go to the browser on my computer on the LAN and type in that IP address I can view the cameras and change any of the settings. This means I won't need a monitor or mouse connected to the DVR and it can be better hidden. It doesn't do you much good to DVR the bad guys and then have them steal the DVR.Installed the app SECU365 as recommended by Zosi. My Norton AV said there was no risk. After it installed it appeared to install something else and all of a sudden Norton said it sent data back to China and was a privacy issue. Considering that this is a view into my home I'm very concerned about anyone hacking into this. It may be safer to forego the remote view. If anyone has info on a different app that is known to be safer please leave a comment.Also a note on the silicone bumpers on the indoor cameras. After regluing they fell out again while installing on ceiling. The camera still held in the position I set it so it wasn't a big deal. Just annoying. I plan to replace the silicone tubes with something different on the next camera I install.3-2-17We have had some milder winter weather in our area so I was able to get all the wiring run in the attic and the outdoor cameras installed. I had a minor problem with one of the outdoor cameras and the vendor responded quickly and took care of the problem. I have been very happy with the quick response on any issue from the seller!With all 8 cameras running full time but not recording any audio I am able to record a few hours less than 2 weeks of video. I have not done much with learning to use the motion detection or the time out for the cameras feature. I would guess that I will get more than 2 weeks of video by only recording motion. I will write more on this topic later when I have more time.One thing I learned was that you can only save video clips out through the front panel USB port. I should have learned this before I installed the system because I had to use a 90 degree USB adaptor and a short cable to access the port.As mentioned before I can view live video, review recorded video, copy recorded video to the front panel USB and change any of the configuration settings from my Win7 browser. I wish there was a way to copy a portion of a recording to my local Win7 drive through the browser. I am planning to write to support if a firmware update would allow to do this or any other features. I will write more on this at a later time.",,"It is lowest cost for such a security system even buying the hard drive separate, and I put a 2TB hard drive and only used 2 of the 4 cameras so I got two more for spares.The instructions are lacking so it takes a little (just a little) ingenuity to figure out things like the red light is power and the green light means the videos are activated and working, and ""play back"" only means play back while we have to go to the main menu and click ""backup"" in order to copy a file onto a flash-drive. The red icon means no sound but this DVR can install a microphone if our State does not object. The small yellow lighted icon is for the motion detector coming on, but even with motion detection the videos are recording 24 hours every day constantly so it gives full coverage.The infrared comes out black-n-white but it is brilliant how it lights up the entire yard like a strobe light and yet completely invisible to our human eyes, except for the little red glow of the infrared around the face of the camera.I attached mine to one of my HDMI's on my TV so to watch a live view outside then I just change from TV over to the HDMI and there it is constantly live monitoring but when I turn away from that HDMI then the TV does not show the video so it harms nothing.I mounted one camera inside but I do not want inside on full time monitoring so I put the power wire hanging loose and so if I ever want the camera inside to start working then I just reach down and push together the loose power cord and then the inside camera comes on only at my comand.I am very happy with this.","Picture quality is great, use of the DVR is pretty straight-forward, and overall I'm very happy with these (especially for the price! I just could not ding a star for two minor issues (below) given the price of this system).Hooked up the app to my phone and now I can see the house while away.Customer service is spot on. I had a hiccup of my own doing and they were quick to respond via email to get me sorted. I sent pictures of my issues, they sent answers. Got me running fast!Setup: mostly easy except the camera assembly has swivel issues. There are two screws that keep the barrel in place that prevent it from easily fine-tuning the angle of the picture after install (see picture). But, loosen those screws and turn the barrel, tighten again, and it does work; it's just not easy at the top of a ladder.Cables: the cable lengths were great - got everywhere I needed them with ease. But, the cable connectors are different lengths (see picture). A bit OCD sure, but try to put them in electrical tape or outdoor tape and you have a lump.Grab a 2TB Storage Drive, also on Amazon, and this is a perfect system for install and walk away.https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IMPO5MO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1Again, for the price, you can't beat this.

Worth buying!,Not bad at all,"Great cameras, at a great price.","This is my 12th security camera install. I have always liked the Zosi brand so when my home needed a upgrade I went with Zosi. To be honest I ordered 2 of the 8 channel 720P DVR + 8 camera setups, just for the 16 cameras. It was just as cheap to order the complete set as opposed to ordering just the cameras separate. I will keep the 2 DVRs for a future jobs.I was disappointed when I opened the box for the dome cameras and saw they where ""PLASTIC"" housings. I almost sent back both systems right there. Zosi in the past has always used aluminum housings on their dome cameras. Plastic will eventually fade and become brittle with UV exposure. I was also disappointed that two of the bullet cameras had stripped screws as I will be contacting the seller directly to get remedied (Seller has been known to have great customer service) I am sure they will work with me to fix the problem.I was pleased with the quality of the 720P vs my old 800 and 1000 TVL cameras. The setup was easy as expected, plug and play and you are done. I was originally worried as I run my cameras through OdiySurveil baluns (See pic) as it makes it easier to run 2 network cables then 8 separate Siamese's (I would highly recommend for any security install, you still need power but easier then ""home running"" each camera feed) Overall I would order the products again. Thanks Zozi!!!!!******************UPDATE***********************Zosi customer service is outstanding, I had 2 bullet cameras that must have been a bad batch and Zosi was quick to remedy the problem and sent me 4 new 1080P cameras to replace the 720P. I have been a life long Zosi fan and this outstanding customer service seals the deal for all my future security camera install needs. Thanks Zosi for being so understanding and just plain awesome!",I bought this about 7 months ago. I had an issue with 2 cameras and reached out to Dealer through amazon. Kelly Chan contacted me and shipped out 2 replacements right away. I understand some stuff is just bad and not the companies fault. I had an issues with my DVR locking up and e-mailed Kelly Chan directly and she had a new DVR shipped to me in about 1 week. I have not had any more Issues and this company's customer service is top notch. The system does what I need it to. setting it up for motion detection is a little tricky but their website has videos to help you through it. Kelly Chan is on my A list for customer service. Job well done.,"Ok. Packaging was nice. The bullet cameras have a metal housing which looks and feels durable. The white blended in nicely with my house (which is also white). The setup was relatively easy. Took a little long to figure out the remote viewing but wasn't too hard. The day quality is really good, Super clearI did have a little issue with some of the dome cameras but Zosi customer service contacted me and was very accommodating . I was able to keep the camera system and they fixed the issue.Definitely worth buying and if you have any issues, Customer service is great (Responsive and accommodating).",considered only going 4 star but i really do like them for the price and they feel like a heavier/sturdier better built camera. added some realistic shots as to what it actually looks like from my DVR,"Most excellent cameras. I got these to expand my system to 8 cams. Well these new Zosi cams are so much better than my Swann cams I am replacing all the Swann cams with these. Wider angle view, much better colour popping out at you. It's a big difference. Given, the Swann cams are about 5 years old. The Swann DVR crapped out so I bought a Zosi unit to replace it. the Swann never really worked right from the beginning. It had major false motion detection problems, making it useless for alerting you via email. It would send tons of false email alerts with pics of an empty yard. Even with the unit zeroed in to small grid areas, tons of false alerts. So it was turned off for alerts. Back to the Zosi unit. So far everything has worked perfectly. With the additional cams it is even better than I've ever had here. Big kudos for Zosi.

Great Price!!!,Easy to use. Superb build quality,easy,Excellent hardware -Use Potplayer to view videos on your Windows PC,Very Affordable and Great Quality,"I have owned several different brands of wireless security camera systems very similar to this one, that is they had two cameras and a portable monitor. No question, the Tonton is the best. Highly recommended!Over the years, as new features became available, such as night vision, Internet connectivity and higher resolution, I would upgrade my system. My last system was 720p and triggered on every movement, and I mean even bugs flying in front of the camera. The night vision was so poor that it was basically useless. Then the internal battery pack, which was not user serviceable, started bulging and cracking the plastic on the back of the monitor. This gave me a good reason to purchase the Tonton system and am I ever happy that I did.The Tonton gives me every option that I ever wanted with one exception. I would like to be able to turn off the Infrared LEDs at times, but I don't think there is any system that will do that. The build quality is very good all around, and I was especially impressed with the camera mounts... they are beefy and solid. By far the best mounts that I have ever seen on these types of cameras. Image quality is stunning, both day and night. On my old system, I could barely recognize myself at night. There would have been no way to identify a stranger. The Tonton has very good night vision. The batteries on the Tonton are common 18650 which are user replaceable. That's a big plus to me, but you don't even need the batteries unless you want to run the monitor in a portable mode. I cannot speak to long term performance because I have only had it for a few days. I did need some tech support (to find a setting in the menu) and they were very responsive.The cameras auto-synced right out of the box and I was blown away by the 1080 resolution, coming from 720p. To me, 1080 is a must have! I am a very demanding consumer. I have high expectations of products that I buy, and I was not disappointed with the Tonton. In fact I am thrilled with it.Bottom Line: The Tonton system has amazing quality and features, especially considering the very modest price. Then consider that you get the 18650 batteries and 32GB memory card included, now that's a great deal.","I liked this Wifi portable NVR so much, I ordered 2 of this model.Build quality is absolutely solid and clean.Set up could not be easier. Basically, just power on the NVR and cameras. Select your local Wifi network and press a button to pair cameras, and NVR.The monitor is touch screen and allows you to view 1 camera at a time, or all at once. You can navigate, adjust setting, control recording time, and settings all from the portable unit. You can zoom into a point of interest. Record based off a schedule or motion detection. Back up video to pc or phone.There is also a useful feature that allows you to speak through the camera to whoever might be present.Image quality is great and night vision is good, although I cant speak on the outdoor performance because both of mine are for indoors.I have contacted customer support a few times with questions and they were fantastic every time!Really very helpful and polite.It's been over a year now since owning these units, and I've seen that they constantly keep the remote view app up to date and improved with new features.After all the years with numerous other brand / systems with their sub par quality and crappy clunky software; I thought it was take it or leave it with NVR systems; until TonTon came along showed me different and impressed me thoroughly!","This is exactly what we were looking for. Nothing fancy, not overloaded with bells and whistles. We just wanted to see who was at the front door before opening it (frosted glass front doors, can't see through). Package arrived quickly and packed well. Easy to use - NVR monitor runs either off electricity or batteries which was VERY IMPORTANT TO US, so when we were outside in the back of house, we could bring monitor with us to see who rang the door bell. The cameras, we had an electrician run electric so cameras were installed through soffit of house. But, you can plug the cameras in anywhere as long as you have an electrical outlet. You can set it up to cover the area you want, use an alarm if you want, use just motion, program to record when you want; set to record automatically with motion, there is an app you can download so you can receive notification over your phone if you want. We did have a problem with the NVR monitor not running on battery only. Monitor wouldn't work off battery. Emailed seller, and received a replacement monitor. Had issues reprograming NVR monitor to match with cameras since cameras were synched with original monitor. Once again, emailed seller and with their help - I was able to reset cameras to match up with the new monitor --- took less than 2 minutes!!! Simple fix!!! Seller sent a video demonstrating how to link cameras to monitor....perfect! Long story short----we are VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT, it is exactly what we wanted. Now we will know who is on the other side of the door...can talk directly to the person. Yup, very happy with this product. Thank you to Will for his patience and quick response. I highly recommend this product! Somebody knock at my door!!!!",,"The Good:Excellent night vision!  Honestly, I was expecting somewhat mediocre quality night vision for this very affordable security system.  I was quite pleasantly surprised at it's quality.No false alarms.  This system has yet to send a false alarm.  The cameras are set up in the courtyard and it's entryway which have very limited activity.  The customer service is spot on.  I dread having to contact ANY customer service, especially if I'm already frustrated with a new gadget, but fortunately this security system has been mostly pretty easy to set up - except...  I was having a recording issue, so I contacted customer service and got it all straightened out quickly.  In all fairness it was user error - but it's comforting to know Tonton's customer service is there if needed again.The Bad:The User Manual could really use an overhaul.  If someone is setting up and using a security system as a first time user, the set up process may take a bit longer to figure out.  It's not intuitive, but, as I mentioned in The Good, their customer service is excellent.So, it's not actually ""bad"" but I would love to have cameras that are both AC and DC powered.  And have the option to use either.  It would make it just a smidge easier to move the cameras, should that be necessary.",299,71,https://www.amazon.com/Tonton-Portable-Touchscreen-Rechargeable-Preinstalled/dp/B07PGLG3XC/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=cobra+security+camera&qid=1640230084&sr=8-15

The camera battery that is rechargeable can sustain a very long time without needing recharged. (6 months)It has held a charge without being connected to electricity OR THE solar panel for over three months, and it is still only 1/2 power on the battery scale. When using it outside, two points of importance, one, the solar panel will keep it constantly charged so electricity will never be needed after the initial charge up. And also the color black is more important to be used on the outside so that in darkness it does not show up as well as if it was white. The camera has PTZ that is accessible from your phone to be able to adjust the camera, and the app allows you to go back in the history and pull up events that occurred usually up to one or two months, depending on the size of the SD card that you put into the camera. Also the camera has a much better picture if HD is pushed on the camera settings. Wifi is necessary if you need to access the camera remotely. You cannot go wrong with the purchase of this camera, the quality of the pictures is excellent and the response time of the camera to record is excellent.","This camera is a HUGE upgrade from the older one that I have from the same company. The video is more clear and the wi-fi extender is EXCELLENT! I have a slower internet and the extender is very nice - no freezing up or slowing down. Being able to move the camera around is an awesome improvement too, keeps me from having to install multiple cameras. It was very easy to connect with their app and set everything up, maybe 10-15 minutes (mainly because after connecting it needs to download a firmware update.) Even installing it outside was super easy, four screws to your base and then put camera on it and tighten down with little screw tabs. If you are looking for a camera but not wanting a huge investment or complicated installation, this one is perfect for that! I highly recommend it!","- Design, build and paint quality is excellent- Since our side patio, yard & walk in area is very narrow and long, the camera can pan the whole side of the house. It also can pan straight down to alleviate any blind spots.- If someone comes to our side entry door we can pan to see who it is and use the speaker (two way speaker) to ask any questions before deciding whether we should open the door. Of course it's also great to see if Amazon or other vendor packages have been delivered. (Panning is done through the use of an icon on your mobile device)- Battery life is very good. In 3 weeks of use the battery is at 85%. (I intentionally left off the solar panel to make sure the battery was good.)- I did encounter one minor problem involving still images not being viewable after the camera detected motion and recorded video. The company was contacted via email and within 24 hours asked for more information. After giving them the info, they responded again within 24 hours with their explanation. (Nothing wrong with the camera … a software app update will be upcoming which should fix the issue.) After working in the computer support area all of my life, I am always impressed by companies which actually care about customers and respond quickly. Kudos to their support team!This is a very nice and functional security camera which I would purchase again.","This come with everything you need, except for the optional memory card. Charge it before you install, and with the solar panel set up to face the sun, you never have to worry about it running out of battery. No monthly subscription required which I love. You can add a microSD card to save footage. The pan and tilt functions work nicely from the app which allows you to expand your view. Motion detection works a little too well, so I would get alerts if strong winds move plants/tree shadows.

I would buy this again and would recommend it to a friend",Just amazing!! Worth every penny! See full review.,Can see who is at your front door at all times day or night.,"UPDATE:7-24-2019:I have upgraded my review to 5 stars.You can see my complete video review on YouTube. Search for ""CASACAM WIRELESS"" in the search bar.You will find 3 videos to view.1. After communicating with the manufacturer they have explained to me that the plastic housing is UV rated.2. It is normal for the camera to feel warm to the touch.3. After having the camera for several days. I have discovered that this system is feature packed with many options to enhance the cameras performance.4. Video quality is very good5. Customer service is excellent.Two Camera Night Vision CasaCam, (this is the system without the extra spotlight).My first impressions: THE CAMERA:1. The camera material feels cheaply constructed. It is plastic no metal or aluminum.2. The lens cover is plastic not glass and is most likely susceptible to scratches and probably yellowing with age (like car headlight covers).3. The infrared L.E.D.’s on the front of the camera (they turn red at night) look poorly soldered.4. The camera is warm to the touch when on (day or night). I don’t know if this is normal.5. The power cord with the supplied extension cable for each camera is about 16 feet long. Not long enough for most installations. They charge $10.99 for additional 15 feet of extension cable.6. They claim the camera is “WEATHERPROOF” but should not be exposed to rain. It is probably fine mounted under an overhang or eave. They should consider making a rain/weather shield.7. The mounting bracket is adjustable but would be much better if it were a ball and socket.8. The instruction manual is better than I expected but is not clear on every function of the camera system. It wouldn’t hurt if they used a larger font.The MONITOR:1. The monitor feels nice with a little weight to it. It should be 10 inches for a better viewing of 2 or more cameras in split screen mode.2. The kick stand on the back is a nice feature but it feels flimsy and will probably break with a little pressure.3. The screen is a touch screen and responds okay but is a little awkward if you don’t get your finger in the right spot (make sure you remove the protective film or it will not perform well at all).4. The menu bar is pretty straight forward and simple. It is easy to figure out once you have played with the system for a few minutes.5. The monitor can be unplugged and carried around. This is a very nice feature. The battery life varies according to reviews I have read. I have used it for about an hour and a half with some charge still available.The Video:1. The daytime video quality is not bad at all. You will be able to recognize someone standing at your front door etc. You will see cars driving up and down the street. You will not be able to read a license plate (unless the license plate is right in front of the camera).2. The motion detection works and is adjustable and can be turned off.3. The night time video is acceptable. It is in black and white (it makes my blue eyes look very creepy) and you may not be able to recognize someone so easily.4. The two way speaker works, but is not as good as I had hoped. It is tinny sounding and there is a lag between talking and listening. You have to press the talk button while talking and release to listen. The playback sound on the video seems to be much better quality than the live audio.5. The SD card is over writable. For best playback I put the SD card in my computer where I have more control over the playback options.6. Internet connection. I am not using that option at this time so I have no comments.BOTTOM LINE:It’s not a bad camera system. The video is very good especially in the day time. The camera system has features for recording times and alarms. The portability of the monitor is an excellent feature. I wish the camera was constructed better. I can’t help but wonder about the longevity of this camera. From all the negative reviews I have read on Amazon the manufacturer has responded to most trying to work with their customers to resolve any issues that have arisen which makes me feel like this is a good company and improvements will hopefully be in the near future. Of course I have already spent my money on a product that for now seems to work very well.","I absolutely Love this camera system! We had been looking for one for forever and tried three other camera’s before we finally found this one! Where we live they don’t have WiFi that works very well so I wanted to get one that didn’t require WiFi and came with a non stationary monitor. I was using them as a kid and dog cameras so I wanted to be able to have two way communication with them as well. This camera fit All my requirements! The two way communication works amazing, the monitor can be carried around without being plugged in (although it doesn’t last very long, only about 4 hours but it also charges back up quickly), it can be plugged into the internet so you can view remotely from your phone, it’s So affordable compared to others, you can add cameras to it, it’s weather resistant, night vision is clear and amazing, saves footage so I can go back and review clips, I haven’t ever had a problem with slow connection and we have a camera outside and in our basement. If I could give it more stars I would! I did my research, tried other more popular cameras but this one was by far my favorite out of all of them! I haven’t had to deal with the company so far because I haven’t had any problems so I don’t really know how their customer service is but I guess that’s a good thing! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!","Exactly what I wanted. This is a nice simple affordable camera system that DOES NOT require wifi, a router or internet to work. Setup is simple, camera's are good, monitor is good, recording of video works as expected. night vision is decent, motion detection works but is not very long range and the audio (one way or two way) is good. Once you download the app to your phone and connect the monitor to your router you can view the camera's remotely, your results viewing the camera remotely will depend on the quality of your internet connection on both ends (camera end and cell phone end). Please understand this is a basic camera system quality of picture is average quality and features are adequate but somewhat limited. If you are looking for a high end feature rich video system this is not it! But if you are looking for a decent camera system with reasonable functionality I highly recommend this product. At this price point I don't think you can do much better. **Quick update** Have owned the product for six months now, It is in continuous use 24/7 One power adapter stopped working, Contacted the company by email and they promptly responded (less then 12 hours) and will send me a replacement no problems no issues. Things break, that's life but quality customer service like this is what makes a product stronger. very pleased!","Amazing product and amazing support!!This system is a must have, no WiFi is required which is what caught my eye. You can always use WiFi for remote viewing which is very secure and for dvr playback.Another plus is that the system can be incorporated with your RV trailer lights. Camera reads 9v, but after emails with the casa team 12v can also be used!! Which is very exciting because I can now use a rearview camera. (See con below)As for my other camera I use as a baby monitor in the buck house of the RV which has amazing video 2 way talking. So if I need to tell my little man to calm down or just to say I love you it works amazing and works great also with the remote app through WiFi.Con- as of right now for the camera settings, image can’t be reversed for the rear backup camera like I have setup. When you look at picture, left is really the right and right is really left if that makes sense. I am just really hoping they release a update to be able to reverse image.We plan on doing a full review on YouTube so more to follow on Gone with The Millers","Shipped fast and packaged very well. Easy too install and setup. No problem connecting too my router. Installed and formatted a128gb class 10 SD card with no problems. The picture quality is excellent and with the monitor being very portable, can use it in any room in the house. A very good security camera system at a great price. Very clear video with the night vision. You can have up too four cameras connected to the monitor at all times. I only have two at the moment but plan on getting two more very soon.",1133,208,https://www.amazon.com/CasaCam-Wireless-Security-Nightvision-Touchscreen/dp/B07P84YG61/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=cobra+security+camera&qid=1640230084&sr=8-13

I like that it's a stand alone system so no complicated connecting to the internet. I put in a 32 GB SD card and it gives my tons of recording time when set on motion detection. I got video the first day of some random old lady milling around on my porch. The video is clear with great sound. The monitor settings are fairly easy to navigate through and set up was a breeze. I ordered a 3rd camera to add on. I highly recommend this system for anyone looking for a stand alone system. Defender is really good about answering any questions you have. I have a wired Defender DVR system at my business that works flawlessly. They are a great company with quality products.Update****I am still very happy with this system. I have caught high school kids lingering on my porch waiting for the bus despite me putting out a note saying to stay off. I was able to catch them in the act and tell them to leave. I have video proof in case anyone tries to say otherwise. I like how clear the video and sound recordings are. It will give me the evidence I need if I have to continue to chase these ill mannered idiots off my property. I would LOVE to show it to all their parents so they can see how they lack in the parenting department.UPDATE**** Still working great. I have a 2 story 3200 sq ft house and there has been no issues with the monitor connection to the cameras which 2 are outside and 1 inside. I am ordering a 4th camera to place on my back porch. The intercom makes it nice as long as I am near the monitor. I can talk to whoever is with in ear shot of the camera. Gives me piece of mind that if something were to happen I will have video and sound footage. I use a 32g sd card and I can get well over a weeks worth of footage with the motion detection set. The camera in my house picks up a lot of movement but the card holds plenty of memory. I have it set to override once full. I don't bother to check it unless we notice something unusual has happens. Then I just pop the card into my laptop and save the video. Came in handy when a stray cat jumped on my back to attack my parrot. My husband didn't believe me until I played the footage back.,We had a similar system from Lorex which has served us well for almost 10 years but something happened to the monitor so we bought this system. The cameras are very nice and feel like a quality camera and I believe made out of aluminum. This is plug and play so no pairing required. The picture quality is very nice and clear. It also has a zoom button and two way audio which is a nice feature to have. Some similar units have only one way audio. This cannot be used over the internet if that's what you want. I have one of the cameras on my workshop which is about a 120' from my house and see no connectivity issues or picture quality issues. This is a very nice home security system that requires no skill level to hook up. If you can open the box you can hook it up.,"I bought my Defender Phoenix M2 on a whim, only because it did not require WIFI. It came with 2 cameras. I could not believe how easy it was to install. The hardest part for me was finding the right camera angles. The features are unbelievable. It even has a zoom feature. The color is great and the night vision is fantastic. I have another system that I paid over $700 for and the night vision is only half as good as the Defender. The best feature is the two way intercom system. The volume could be louder, but for what your getting for the price, you can't complain. This system is great if your on your sofa and someone rings your doorbell. You can simply talk to them over the intercom. I'm actually thinking if buying another one for my daughters house. I rate this system a 10 out of 10. You should probably have some handy man skills running the power wires, but that's it. No hard wiring. A/V or Ether etc cables, no hassles trying to sync it to your internet, like my expensive system which took me 2 days!! If you want an inexpensive great wireless system with tons of great features that won't slow down your internet speed, then this is the one for you. I have added a side by side daytime screen picture and 2 single full screen night vision pictures.","I've had this security system for about 4 months now. I usually wait before reviewing. This system is excellent. The people who complain about it either don't know how to use it or they can't be pleased. The signal is very good. We have two cameras. One is in the balcony and the other is in the front patio. At first, I would review the monitor every day but now I don't bother. The picture quality is very good but just keep in mind it is not HD. The SD card that came with it is sufficient because it just overwrites one the card is full. This is not a wifi system which is fine with me because I don't use Wifi. I'm happy with it being a self contained unit.UPDATE: I've had this camera 4 years now and it's still great. The customer service was also very good. One of the cameras stopped working and the manufacturer replaced it during the warranty period. Also the AC adapter to the other one broke and they replaced that too. That was all about 3 years ago during the warranty period. If these break, I'll get a truly HD system but for the price these have been excellent.","I have been using the Defender system for around 6 months and I am totally satisfied with the product. It has functioned right out of the box - literally plug-and-play and continues to function flawlessly. It comes with 2 cameras, which is all I needed, but you can expand it with 2 more cameras purchased separately.I literally spent days researching all security camera offerings on Amazon and other online shopping vendors. Almost all of the offerings were for security cameras which relied on the ""cloud"" to store the recordings and a cell phone app to access them. Most also required a monthly service fee of one kind or another to get at your own recordings.I checked into fake security cameras - no wiring needed - I recommend that no one go that route - pointless - crooks can tell the difference.The Defender met all of my requirements: camera communicated via WIFI to a standalone mini computer - all the cameras need is a power source. I simply drilled a small hole through a wall and plugged in the power cord. The power cord has 2 sections so that you do not have to drill a hole as large as the wall plug. I use a simple appliance surge protector for each camera and the mini computer. The cameras are weather resistant - not water proof - they have not been affected by rain or snow as the roof eaves give partial protection - I may add a simple aluminum shield at a later date.The cameras have both day and night infrared optics. The cameras have a motion sensor with a wider range than the camera so that it starts recording even before the moving target enters the camera range. The mini computer analyzes the pixels and will begin recording if there is enough pixel changes to activate a motion hit - you can control the sensitivity. On the highest sensitivity, it will pick up bushes moving in a light breeze. The sensitivity settings are camera specific. They pick up small animals moving in the yard and the images are clear and crisp.The cameras also have a mic to pic up sound - so you can hear any conversation trespasser has. You also have an option to speak to someone outside via a speaker built into the camera.It comes with a SD memory card that is totally adequate but I ordered an additional memory card in case I had to turn over one to the police for evidence. If you use the continuous recording option, you might want to consider getting a larger SD memory card. I review any recordings daily and delete them if they show nothing worth keeping. The SD card holds 8GB or 700 minutes.The WIFI is good for 150 feet and was unaffected by walls, floors and ceilings. I was able to locate the mini computer anywhere in my 3 story with basement 5,000 sq ft house.You can record based on motion detection, scheduled recording periods, constant recording (it overwrites oldest recordings automatically - option), or on demand (press a REC button). You can control how long it will record from 15 seconds to 1 min for the motion detection recording. You can schedule each camera separately with selections by day (Monday), date (1-5th) and time ranges.You can individually turn cameras on and off, adjust brightness and adjust resolution. You can monitor cameras individually, with split screen or by rotation. You also have a SLEEP mode which will turn on the display only if it goes into recording mode.The recordings file screen appears as a calendar with days with recordings marked in blue - you can filter the calendar by all cameras or just one and search prior months. When you pick a day, all recordings for that day appear in a list for you to select and view and/or delete.This system is extremely well designed with all the features anyone could want and they are easy to understand and use.",943,275,https://www.amazon.com/Defender-PHOENIXM2-Security-Cameras-Surveillance/dp/B08W1TSCVH/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=cobra+security+camera&qid=1640230084&sr=8-19

Probably most of them were from folks who might not have properly set theirs up. As for me, it worked perfectly right out of the box. Nice, sharp images, both day and night. For the price of this unit, there's no complaints here. I opted for one with no HDD so I could install my own. From past experience I've learned that shipping items with a hard drive might be damaged from rough treatment along the way. I installed a 1TB SSD and it worked beautifully. Added an additional 4 cameras also. Packaging was outstanding. It was all packed as a new computer would be. Very strong and tight. I would purchase again and this seller goes high on my list.","Installation was simple. The DVR detected all cameras with no issues. The WiFi signal level wasn't all that impressive, but I did not experience any 'drop off' of cameras as seen in some other reviews. I may have to add an antenna extender to the furthest camera, but that doen't concern me that much. One feature that really stood was how easy it was to connect to a cell phone or other mobile device. Simply install the ZOSI Smart Viewer on your device, then scan the QR code on the DVR. That's it!

Still don't know if they sell footage to China",Protect what you have worked hard for!,Don't be afraid of the price point! Quality product,Worth it.,Peace of mind is priceless,"I am highly privacy driven both in public and in cyberspace. The system works great. The interface is pretty easy to use. Great 1080p picture. Great night vision. I went with hardwired cameras due to their lack of vulnerability to cyber threats. However, the DVR does have an ethernet connection and there is an app you can use to monitor the system. I will continue exploring the cyber vulnerabilities of this system to ensure it does not sell info or footage to a third party. The only gripe I have is that the motion detection is pretty touchy, even at the lowest sensitivity level. One bug flying in front of it and I'll get a notice. I also noticed that if a car drives fast enough in front of my residence, I still get a motion detection notice even though I have removed that area from my camera's detection grid. For the money, I can't complain. Better than paying ADT $40/month to tell me my dog tripped the alarm. Be prepared for a hard day in the attic or crawl space to install, that's the price you pay for hardwired systems.","Our peaceful safe neighborhood has recently become a target for crime. Houses and cars have been broken into almost daily. So we decided to purchase a security system before we were hit. This was our 1st ever security camera purchase. I did not know anything about how to pick one so I did a lot of research and eventually decided on this one. We got the 8camera and 500gb hard drive.It arrived fast and great packaging.Hookup was a bit challenging and time consuming (maybe because this was our 1st) but took a while to get the cords ran. So patience is a plus for all brands I would assume not just this one. But soon that time consuming part was worth it. The picture is crystal clear even in pitch dark. We. Couldn't believe how good it was in night vision. Daytime is just as clear. We have it hooked up to a computer screen that was not being used and its perfect. We have recommended it to everyone . great system, crystal clear pictures and good customer service.Luckily,we have not caught anyone trying to break in our stuff that we have worked hard for many years to get. But if we do we will be ready.Although we have not caught burglars we have caught wildlife on camera. We live in the country/woods type of area and have seen our daily visit from our neighborhood bear as well as raccoon and opposums. I am attaching a pic of the night vision and one of our bear sightings. We only have up 5 of the cameras right now. The pictures are pictures of the screen with my phone but still pretty good quality.","Better than expected! Received it on 5-17-17 hooked it up and the clarity is more than I need. Also love the night vision , also very clear. Was Leary because of the price point but after reading a majority of the feed back I purchased it. Glad I did!","Absolutely worth the money. I’ve had a different swann system and that hard drive fried after one singular storm... this system has gone through several power surges, storms, and a tornado. It’s still kicking. I was able to use those 4 swann cameras with this device for a total of 8, just waiting to find the perfect spot for the last camera. It’s perfect. Easy to set up and use. The app was also easy to set up. Downside is that every time the internet or power goes out you have to reconnect the system to the app, but it is what it is. Not a big deal. I did give the night vision a 4 star because I wish it was just a tad bit clearer. The app has a feature that you can take screen shots and videos of recordings. You can go back almost two weeks. The zoom is incredible. Overall, I’d recommend this to everyone.","I recently got this set-up after attempting a cheaper IP wireless camera. For my needs, the IP camera was a wash and difficult to set up and use. I decided to bite the bullet and spend a little more for this system. I do not regret it one bit! The set up is relatively easy, although wires are almost always a pain. After testing the system, I installed 3 of the 4 cameras. The included cables are more than generous in length. Although the cameras are waterproof, the connections are not, so for the one camera that isn't under the roof line, I did have to get some marine quality heat shrink wrap and a heat gun. All in all, once installed, the system is a breeze to set up. As it has a built in hard drive, it's so much easier than getting a cheaper system that requires an additional hard drive. I like that I can see, playback, and even record segments from my phone. In addition, the included DVR is easy to use and maneuver through. This is the 1st security system I ever installed, and I now feel like an expert after doing this myself. I would absolutely recommend this system, and I've actually already convinced a few neighbors to get the same system. I have a feeling I will be helping a few neighbors with their installations, now.",5578,901,https://www.amazon.com/ZOSI-Security-Recorder-Weatherproof-Smartphone/dp/B00MP57IOY/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=cobra+security+camera&qid=1640230084&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&smid=A252W7I0ACJHS1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyMjNPRUhaTDVGREFQJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTY0NDk5Mzc1UTZLMEZYM0JBNCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNTc2MzM5MlY0NzcwMUdQQlpTSCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

That said, I am a tech professional and did a ton of research before deciding that this model was the best value for me. Just got the dash camera delivered this past week, and it did not disappoint.Its got amazing video quality, and I found it very easy to setup. Lots of settings I have not played with yet, but it seemed to work well out of the box. The larger display size is nice - particularly because I have it monitoring my rear camera.A few things to note: I found that the ""Quick Start Guide"" on Cobra's website has a lot more useful information than the printed version in my box. And the Voice Commands feature is really really cool; worked very well for me - I use ""Take photo"" and ""Lock Video"" a lot! Finally, there are two free apps that work with this camera, Cobra iRadar and Drive Smarter. I have been using the second one a lot more - and found it to be nifty. Made it easy to connect my iPhone with the dashcam, and update the camera's firmware. I've been using it to share videos - so convenient to not have to remove the camera from my vehicle or pop out the SD card.All in all - ""Two thumbs up"" for me!","Finding the right dash camera with all the selection out there today can be daunting so I'll tell you our experience and why we chose the SC 201 from Cobra. I also added some unboxing images bc that's important to me. Shape/Size, video quality, forward facing and in cab facing, and brand recognition were key factors when making our decision. There are all sorts of shapes and sizes out there now. A small sleek profile that doesn't block visibility was step one. Next we wanted HD/clear video quality 1080P bc what's the use if you can't make anything out clearly if and when we ever wanted to share for fun or when we actually needed it. We have young kids and if you do, you know the best things that ever come out of their mouths are in the car.. When else are we all in one place together without electronic distraction and have time for conversation... Lastly, we couldn't pronounce half the brands out there let alone trust the ones we could and have never heard of. My husband has had Cobra CB's in his trucks over the years and has their marine radios on our boat. Never had issues so we started and ultimately ended here because they have been around for ever and no reason why they wont be for a ling time. Also we found they have every applicable type or use case dash cam you could want.Product itself came with everything we needed including the SD card. We are happy with the size (I'll update with the mounting location in our truck later) and the mounting bracket provides flexibility and is small when you don't have the camera mounted. First couple trips around town and really pleased (actually surprised) on the quality of the video. Has already provided mediation in a dispute, which I won, and for the record after reviewing the tape HE was supposed to defrost the fish for dinner that night.. :)","I have been looking for a dashcam for a few weeks. I wanted something easy to use and set up with just some basic features. This dashcam goes above and beyond. It has front and rear video and both have fantastic picture quality in day or night driving. The front dashcam is a great size, takes up minimal windshield space, and the HD video display covers the entire backside of the unit for maximum screen size with no wasted space. The rear dash cam is the same with a small size dashcam so it's not in the way when I look out my rearview mirror. Rear cam picture is also HD Video and displays on the fronts screen if you want or change the setting for no display. Here is where this dashcam goes above and beyond, it has a built-in Forward Collision warning system and Lane Departure Warning. It's like upgrading my car! This dashcam has alerts for red light cameras and road hazards. I downloaded the app and didn't even need to call customer service to help, simple to set up and understand. Great price and I am thrilled.","This camera is a replacement of a old camera of a different brand. I really like that you can see the symbols on the screen to let you know what the buttons are for. It's easy to set up with your phone and you can change the settings on the camera or on your phone.Both came with a adhesive stick on mount which I don't know how long that would last. I used the stick on mount for the rear camera and I bought a mount for my rear view mirror that can swivel. My old camera had a suction mount that would fall off about every month and the camera thought it was in a crash and stop recording. This camera has a separate file for events like this. I also like that you can remove the camera easily because of the magnetic connection for the mount. My wife hit it with her hand the other day reaching for something on the dash and it did not fall, all I had to do was readjust the camera mount that is on a swivel mount. I have not used the talk to camera option yet, but I don't use that option on my phone either.The camera quality is great and it has a little weight to it. The night vision is very good even on the rear camera and I have a tinted rear window. The picture quality is also great.I liked this camera enough that I bought one for my truck.I downloaded the IRadar app that works with the camera but I found out that it has a subscription that I don't really need. I guess if I traveled alot it may be worth it.",Worth the money I have both versions this one is really nice the old setup didn’t come with go’s built in. Plus they give you so much cable it’s sick. I put this in the new body style impala very nice and the app works great.I would say it’s worth it’s money easy.,394,57,https://www.amazon.com/Cobra-Smart-SC-200D-Built/dp/B08C483M2K/ref=sr_1_21_sspa?keywords=cobra+security+camera&qid=1640230084&sr=8-21-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyMjNPRUhaTDVGREFQJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTY0NDk5Mzc1UTZLMEZYM0JBNCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDEzMTQ2OEFRWEk0NFJLSUxSJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYnRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

Safe With Encrypted Channels,Super clear cameras,Great cameras all around!,Amazed by these cameras.,Easy setup and great video quality! Simple App!,I am so happy I found this product! I was skeptical about cameras connecting to my home due to hearing of problems relating to other brands and hackers. This camera connects to a safe and encrypted server every time you log in to view your cameras so I am always able to feel at ease! These cameras are wonderful and the price you are paying makes them even BETTER! They have great quality and set up takes no longer than 5 minutes! Upon receiving the cameras (in a timely manner I might add) they were nicely packaged with an instruction manual that made set up easy and quick. The longest set up time was finding where I was going to put them! The adhesive 3m tape worked great as I stuck it to the side of a wall and I haven’t had any problems. The app is the third one down in the App Store (I have pictured the correct one for reference). As you can see in the live shot I included the image is clear and the two way sound works wonderful. I love being able to check in on my dogs all day when at work and being able to speak to them through the camera makes things ten times better! Definitely recommend this product!,"Pros: the picture quality on these is wonderful. I can see everything so clearly, even with the night vision. The microphone works well too. It’s 2-way. The instructions were simple and very clear. I love that this comes with both the micro SD card option and the cloud upload option for recordings.Cons: completely user/reader error... I didn’t read the product description very carefully and thought these were outdoor cameras. They are not. I also thought that “wireless” meant cordless. Not the case. These have to be plugged in to work. Both were not a deal breaker. I found a great use for them indoors and they were easy to install with the plug attached.If you are looking for an inexpensive way to feel secure, check in on animals or have a baby monitor, these are definitely the way to go.","If you're looking for something super simple and affordable for piece of mind this is it. I'm honestly impressed with the image quality for the price. Night vision is pretty amazing. Picture shown of my room is dark but not pitch black, outside pic is pitch black. Alerts work well, annoyingly well, but you can adjust sensitivity or set a schedule etc. Love the fact it comes with two 32gb memory cards so you're ready to go out of the box. Set up was very simple. Literally download the app, plug in camera, pick up camera and scan a barcode that pops up on your phone to sync and you are viewing live. Playback is my only gripe because just the smallest slide will fast forward or rewind by a few minutes. Hard to pin point exact times, not impossible. Might be better to have it just record on movement detection but i just keep it on full time. Speakers work very well, can talk to my dog while he's on my bed. This was a deal breaker lmao. You can also hear from the mic in the camera so you can use as a baby monitor or hear your wife's boyfriend. I know these are indoor but I put one against a window and it worked perfect for daytime but at night there was nothing but glare from the ir light. I just decided to say screw it and mount it outside under the car-port where things don't really get weather damaged. Seems absolutely fine this morning: no dew in the lens or anything and I added pics just to show. Will update review if I totally screwed up but with the price I doubt I'll get too mad either way.Edit: about a week outside under the carport and no noticeable difference or damage whatsoever. Working perfect.. Would not put it somewhere it can get rained on for sure. Will update again after a whileNew pic added at midnight still going strong outside. Keep both cameras on event recording and playback is sooo much better.5 month update! New picture added with timestamp for proof. Outside camera still going strong. Noticed recently it was going offline occasionally and figured out it was the power cord going bad from the weight of the extension cord pulling down on it. Micro usb are used for everything so really not an issue, most people have a thousand of them these days. Bedroom camera still great because theres no pressure on that cord.. Other than that literally no problems other than the occasional alert from curious critters :)",I own 2 Wyze cams and several eufy cams and I like them both but the quality picture on these cameras tops them both.

However, they should have explained this in the product description. The alarm duration is short and cannot be expanded unless you sign up for cloud.I would have given 5 starts if they would have explained that some of the functionalities require cloud sign up.","I am SO glad I got these! I bought 4 of them to put around my house. It sends accurate and precise notifications to my phone. The picture quality is good and the sound quality is good. I love that I can hear clearly, they can hear me on the other end clearly, and the alarm is louder than I expected. Really easy to set up and install. I am extremely happy with this purchase.","This security camera is the simplest that I ever had to set up and operate. I received the package two weeks ago, I figured I can plug the main unit in and then install the cameras the next day. The configuration of the device did not take more than 10 minutes before I was able to view the live stream on my phone and the default settings worked great so I did not have to tweak them other than letting the cameras send me notifications on my phone.",1317,227,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Starlight-Recognition-Deterrent-Weatherproof/dp/B07YB3SRZ8/ref=sr_1_21?keywords=continuous+recording+security+camera&qid=1640229535&sr=8-21

Amazing customer service....,"Great product, great experience",You get product that worth more than its price w awesome customer service,Great customer service !,Better than i expected.,"So I wanted to put up some security cameras just for some added protection. I went with this system because it came with 2 1080p cameras and a 1080n dvr with a 1tb hard drive. Overall the system works great. Awesome picture quality in the day and great picture at night. I want to say it was easy to install but there is always going to be an issue with finding a place to make a hole to run the cable. After it was all set up I turned it on. Out of the box the picture quality was just Ok. Only a few issues with picture being to bright or fuzzy. I then went through the menus and found all kinds of setting to mess with. After a few days and nights of adjusting and a lot of online reading I was able to get the quality up to 1080p standards. The only complaint I would have is that is doesn’t come with a book telling you what all the settings do. And even today. There are a few I still can’t figure out. I have it set up to continually record and I am not using any online streaming programs or the motion detection. I just recently bought 2 more cameras to add to the system. Overall I am really happy with it. Can’t beat the price anywhere.There were some reviews that I read before I bought it that made me think it’s not any good but I still went with it. People complaining about it rebooting all the time just never found the setting to disable auto reboot maintenance. You can also back up important videos with a flash drive, you don’t need the internet plugged in at all. You can also update via the usb with a flash drive. And if you do buy this system or any other system, don’t forget that you need to regularly clean the cameras lens to keep your picture quality good. I clean min about twice a month unless we get a lot of rainfall and or dusty windy weeks. I have already recommended this system to two of my friends.After about a month I started having issues with the dvr. The hard drive started showing errors and wasn’t recording. The playback was freezing and everything was running sluggish. I got ahold of Hiseeu and got helped right away. They said my dvr probably had a defected board. They quickly sent out another dvr and even gave me a free upgrade to 8ch dvr. The hard drive got formatted on my pc and I put it right in. Works so well I think I will have to order a few more cameras. Hiseeu’s customer service was amazing. Talked to them about my issues on Thursday and I had my replacement on Saturday.","Initially I wasn't expecting very much from this product based on the price.However, after using it for a while I found this product to be of excellent quality. It met and exceeded my expectations and had many features and abilities. I was not expecting.I had it for a short while and then I experienced a problem with the hard drive. I contacted the vendor and they responded with courtesy and in a very timely manner. They sent me a new hard drive and installed and have been using and enjoying this product very much. It is a very good product for the money. Based on my experience with this vendor I would have to say that it is a very high quality company. I think you should know that.",i love how the performance of this product exceeded beyond my highest expectstions. it is as said in the description your get more value fir your money. And not only thwt you will get too of the line customer service stress free no bs customer service and its stress freee they will replace defective item guaranteed .,"This system is awesome! No, its not the top of the line, but for your money, you are getting a great value because this system is comparable to the best. No, its not 1080P, but the description states 1080N. Still, a very crisp video. Bottom line, I know I got a great DVR and cameras for my money. Oh, did I mention their fantastic customer care and service? They contacted me and wanted to make sure I was pleased with my purchase.",I found it easy to set up and install. There was a video i mean a lot of videos explaining how to install if you have any doubt on what to do. Many options and sensitivity settings for up to 8 cameras. Night visions works great also. Wires were long enough to hide from front of house to back where my cable tv enters the house. The other 3 cameras were closer so i didn't need to purchase the 100ft extension. I had to make the hole bigger of course since the connectors were pretty large ( my only complaint ). Only took a few couple hours to install since i took my time hiding the wires and attaching the cameras. It helps to have a staple gun for holiday lights for the wires. The app you can download to view the cameras on my phone works a lot better than i expected.,496,171,https://www.amazon.com/Hiseeu-Security-Surveillance-Waterproof-Detection/dp/B07D3SYFKH/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=continuous+recording+security+camera&qid=1640229535&sr=8-16

My neighbor showed me pictures on her phone of the landlord and workers, (that were painting the outside) enter her place which she had not yet moved out of. I asked what she used to get these and she showed me the Wyze v2. So I jumped on line and search out her camera. I came across the v3. I did more digging to see what the difference were and the first was size. I was able to use the magnetic mount and mount it to my fish tank rack. It looks like from a distant something for my tank. It is just over 25 feet from the camera to the front door. I watch a few YT videos and it out performs the v2 and it have color night vision. I have not test this out yet, but is a dimly lit room you can see in color and clearly.

Meanwhile, during the night, someone came into our very well lit parking lot and cut out my catalytic converter!!! Just mine (apparently Honda Elements are targets..who knew?) Anyway, I was so upset. It cost me almost $2000 to get it fixed. So I decided if the board won't get cameras...I WILL. So I bought this and it has been the BEST THING EVER! I just prop it in my window (which has a screen that cannot be removed) and it's perfect. I can have it right up against the screen and still see everything or close the window and it will still be fine through the window AND screen! I have it aimed at the parking lot. I can see the entire condo complex with this thing! Amazing! I can see everything at night! Every time there is motion, it saves a 12 second blip and I can go back and look at them or be notified of them when it happens! I haven't tried the siren feature yet. All I know is that I finally feel safe after my ordeal of being ripped off. The picture is great. People have noticed it because it has a red or blue light. Which is a good deterrent from crooks as well. Best purchase in a long time. Should have done it sooner!",,"Love this camera. It was so comforting that I had it when I went on my trip. Downside is you can only run this on a 2.4ghz frequency. And your wifi name has to be all in one word. Example: JohnDoe24 Special characters and spaces didn't do too well for me.

The set up of the mini was FAR EASIER than the outside cams. I had this thing set up in less than 5 minutes. Picture is good. Sound is LOUD which is what I was looking for.The app however needs some work to support this style of camera. The app works decently for the BlinkXT cameras and functionality, which is motion for most users. As in you get a notification that there is motion, it records, and you watch the recording or live as you please. but it is clunky to get into the Blink Mini for the purpose of continuous viewing which is my intention for this camera, like a baby monitor. Like many other Americans now working from home with a full house of kids, I wanted to use this to assist with keeping an eye on the kids as I worked and record those cute moments. I wanted to use this to visualize a blind spot that I can’t see from the office. I tried mounting it from the ceiling and realized you can’t rotate the video. Mounting on the wall was a little problematic, I couldn’t quite get the right angle needed.Another quirk to the app is if you switch to another app and then come back to the Blink app, you have to hit the play button to resume viewing.All in all, these are minor issues specific to my use of the camera which is why I have it five stars anyway.Hey amazon/Blink, it would be an awesome feature if you’d allow the integration of this camera with Alexa so we can “drop in” and talk through the Echo Dot. Just saying.",I love this lil camera!! Easy to install! Only took 5 min and it works great!! Highly recommend this!!,Great price and product. Connected very easily to my existing Blink system. I am not happy with having to pay for storage after trial ends.,"This is a great little camera monitor. Pros: easy set up, easily managed with your smart phone, clear image quality with motion detection. Can be set up to arm and record at any time. I bought this to use in my master bedroom by my desk where I keep sensitive information.Cons: if you are using it with another Blink product and you arm 24/7 then the other Blink unit also needs to be armed which is an issue because my other unit uses 2 AA batteries. There is no timer on the app to set up a time to arm which would by useful because I sometimes forget to arm at night. It has good night vision quality. It needs to be plugged in so is a problem if you put it in a place (i.e. bedroom closet) if there is no outlet. Because of this, it is difficult to make the camera more hidden (if you are looking for a nanny camera for example).Overall it is easy to use and I would recommend it for a basic home security camera.","SO...I rarely write reviews but was so amazed by this camera I wanted to let others know. I bought the camera after using the Ring indoor camera for twice the price and it made a constant clicking noise with the filter adjustment to light in the room that was a known issue Ring told me and not a defect. I've tried all the other brands out there WYZE, etc and disappointed with all. Then I tried the Blink Mini which I thought was a good price. The setup was a breeze, up and running in 30 seconds. The app is responsive and user friendly. My wifi is sloooow but it still loaded a 1080p HD quality view w hen I accessed it from my mobile app. My favorite feature is the night vision. All my previous cameras just showed a dark room or shadows but this camera shows a clear and crisp picture in pitch black darkness. Very pleased with this and you can't go wrong here.

How does it stack up against Nest?",SO much functionality for 30 bucks! WOW.,You can view anywhere from your phone. No temperature detection,Floored. These are game changers.,Best Bang for the Buck,,"I'm a bit of a camera addict. I have hardwired (fixed) cameras that are hooked up to a DVR, and I have 4 Nest cams as well. But we have a lot of pets, and I wanted to have some PTZ cams to be able to look around and check on them when we are away. I heard several tech podcasts (TWiT, Stacey on IoT) ranting and raving over this Wyze cam, so I took the plunge on one. WOW, how amazing to get all this, for $30 (plus shipping)! The image is super-clear, and I LOVE the ability to scan around a room via my phone. I even installed the Wyze app onto my Pixelbook, and when I enlarge the image on my big screen, it looks incredible. I have only had the camera hooked up for a day, and I am still learning the ropes, but I am SO pleased, I am going to order another two, if not three cameras right away!The motion detection feature is pretty slick. I set up the camera in our spare bedroom, where some of our cats hang out, and when Barbie came in, the camera detected her and began following her movements. She was intrigued at the noise (noticeable, but not loud, btw) of the camera whirring, turning. I have attached a screenshot I grabbed via the app, where she is examining the Wyze cam! Highly recommended.","After going through multiple nursery cams, I am SUPER impressed with this camera (especially for the money)! No app issues, great video quality, simple easy setup. Hands down better than the other video monitors we’ve had.","I have tried many cameras the advantages are ease of use of use, setup, and cost. Possible disadvantages are that it works only with the Wyze app as of now. The Wyze Pan and its fixed counterpart are game changers. If you don't need a cloud Cam or an outside security cameras these cameras set the bar. They aren't the best cameras but they are incredible values are as close to zero setup as possible. Frankly floored by these things. Buy one to try the worse case is you loose less than $50 and 10 minutes to setup. If you already have another Wyze camera it will take longer to get out of the box than to get it working. Great thing for many users. I'm not throwing my other cameras away, but the other camera makers need to be paying attention.","There aren't many security cameras with all of the features that Wyze packs in - and NONE at this price-point. I got high capacity GB SD cards that literally save a month's worth of activity and is immediately accessible remotely. You don't really need them tho as you also get 14 days of Cloud storage free. Those photos/videos you save there can then be easily shared thru a variety of ways (text, email, print, etc). The complaints below are a combination of user errors (like not adjusting the pan/tilt speeds) and/or poor WiFi connectivity (or just a bum unit that should be replaced). My system connected flawlessly and I only have 100Mbps service in a rather large home. There is little, if any lag, and the high definition picture blows others away.While this is an indoor camera I shoot mine through internal windows for the same effect. The image shown is thru my living room window to the front door. No more wondering when you get deliveries as WYZE notifies you immediately and saves the clip in a notification email to you. You simply can't buy peace of mind for under $40 - unless of course you get this camera.",72702,9,https://www.amazon.com/Wyze-1080p-Indoor-Camera-Vision/dp/B07DGR98VQ/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=continuous+recording+security+camera&qid=1640229535&sr=8-13

Had a Blink camera in the living room and realized we needed one for the kitchen/dinning room. Found this and liked that it moved. The picture is better than the blink, really clear HD, and the movement makes it great to use to check up on the puppy as she sometimes sleeps in corners. The price and ease of use is great as well. Only negative is that when operating the camera movement remotely, it does make a semi loud noise (for a dog at least). She hears it move and it sets her off barking lol. But other than that, great product. Glad we got it!","This camera is great!!It moves to where You want it and it has a zoom. It was easy to install, it connected to my wifi thru the app. It started working immediately. It had a long cord but you'll have to add a extension cord if it doesn't reach your plug, of course!

Contacted seller through Amazon and they immediately sent the correct item and an RMA for the wrong one. Must have used express because I rec'd it in 2 days. Then I had trouble getting system setup. I had an 8 channel system ,same brand, that I was wanting to upgrade so knew a bit about setup. This was supposed to be easier, just plug and play. But it was only loading some cameras and then losing connection and I could not get all 6 cameras to function properly. I contacted seller again late on a Saturday night and informed them I thought NVR was faulty. That began a series of 15 to 20 emails and replies over the next 2 1/2 days working on system.. support saying he thought it was interference because he could access the NVR and it looked good...I still believed it to be NVR as I could NEVER get all 6 cameras on. Finally I got up in middle of night Monday night and tried one more time before I was going to demand refund... In the dark I discovered that as odd as it sounds 2 of the 6 power adapters were defective( at least 1 of those was an old one of mine) This wasn't readily evident because I had 2 good ones in computer room and when I got camera connected to NVR I moved the camera to other areas where th bad adaptesr were and never used same ones so didnt catch the fault. and support wasnt aware that I was connecting cameras to a different adapter when camera went supposed off line... after fixing that issue all was good and I now have all 6 cameras running and doing GREAT. Support was helpful and patient and always answered email within an hour os so... was very impressed with interaction with the support personnel... and am very pleased with this Xmarto system. I've used Xmarto for at least 8 or 9 years and they are always dependable and have good quality pictures. The night vision cameras have worked for years now without loosing quality. The first system I had 10-12 years ago cost twice as much and the night vision cameras had to be replaced every 2-3 years as they deteriorated that badly.","I bought my original XMarto system for a friend many years ago, at the same time I bought a system for my own property security, both systems are still working perfectly with no deuteriation whatsoever, and very little maintenance and trouble free..I recently bought a new 8 channel system as there systems have gone ahead in leap's and bounds in every respect, and I wanted to add PTZ. I removed my old system and installed the new system and right out of the box everything worked perfectly, new system only came with 4 cameras so I used 4 of my old cameras, same thing, joined the new system no problem.There old software apps were a bit dicky, but it seems that all the bugs are out as the new apps are working perfectly.The images on my monitor, television and my phone are outstanding and the security aspect is excellent, just make sure you use a very strong password.","Recently my family member purchased a house and needed a surveillance camera system to be installed on doors and garage. Private installation companies were too expensive, so decided to set up a DIY system. Found this camera within the budget and it was mentioned that easy to install. The package was on time and well package. Although I need to run to a hardware store to get some accessories so that I can set up an efficient system, the power cables were short so needed some extension setup. No WIFI or anything required, easily download the app and customize the settings. Great buy for a home.",This is a fantastic security system. It was indeed very easy to install and very user-friendly to set up. The quality of the images is great and because it has wireless cameras you do not need to deal with the hassle of wires from NVR to the position of cameras. You only need to connect the camera to the power each one has a power adapter with a long cable. The application allows you to remotely monitor your home and in this model you can install a separate microphone with each camera to record audio too.

With the new indoor cam I can now access all my cams from one app. To me the picture quality is great overall and especially in total darkness. Live view connection is a lot more stable than my Wyze cams. Alexa integration is a big plus, no need for third party hacks to complete routines. Because I already have Ring cameras it’s worth it to pay a little more over a Wyze cam.","In February, I noticed my ADHD medication ran out early. I’m very careful about taking it exactly as prescribed so it was strange that I had run out 10 days early. For reasons I won’t get into for this review, I suspected the property manager of my building was stealing it. Obviously that sounded crazy, but I couldn’t think of another explanation. A friend suggested a Ring camera, so I bought one never expecting anything to actually come of it. I put some antihistamines in my now empty pill bottle thinking no one would ever take them, set up the camera when it arrived, and felt more secure knowing it was there. Set up was simple so I figured worst case scenario, I was out a bit of money and I spent maybe 10 minutes setting it up.Fast forward a week later when I get a notification via the app that there was motion detected on my camera. I open up the recording and there she is, entering my apartment, going right for my decoy pills, taking them, and leaving. I immediately left work to get back home. I called the police who sent an officer. I showed him the video and he admitted that had I not had the video, he wouldn’t have believed me. I was able to quickly and easily send the video to the police and to the president of the company that owns my building. I also was able to download the video and get it uploaded so that I have copies of it as I go through the next few months as she (hopefully) gets brought to justice.I cannot emphasize how much this little camera has helped me. I would not have caught my burglar otherwise. Because of it, they were able to look up records of who used their electronic key to access my apartment and she had been in there 7 times over the month prior. This would have gone on for longer and who knows if it would have resulted in harm to myself or my cat had I not caught her. This camera has given some of the sense of security she stole from me back and stopped a nightmare situation from worsening. I will still be recovering from this for long time and I am hoping she is brought to justice, but I cannot thank Ring enough for helping me secure my home from an unexpected source of danger.","This camera for $60 is a solid deal.

Works well for the backyard.,Wireless Freedom - Ring Cam Battery,"New Camera, New Update!!","I have a Ring pro on my front door and loved it so much that I wanted something for the back patio since I have contracts (lawn, pool, trees, etc) in my backyard. My challenge however is that all the walls on the patio are either stucco or rock, which makes it near impossible to run a hidden power line. So I opted for this option and so far it works great. The lights are pretty bright and the motion detection works as expected.As for the battery life, it has been in for a couple weeks and it has lost about 10% battery. So I’m guessing it will last about 3 months before it needs a charge. I just ordered a second battery which should double that battery life.The connection is very quick, it seems to connect much faster than my front door, but in fairness it is closer to the wireless router.As for installation, I installed it using the provided screws into the frame of my patio door. It actually works perfect there because you can’t really see it and allows me to perfectly position it for motion detection.My only complaint is the motion zone setup. Unlike the ring pro where I can “draw” motion zones (which significantly helps reduce motion alerts), it only allows you to specify a distance. It really isn’t very intuitive, so I just leave it at mid-range and it seems to work just fine for now.Beware, in order to have video playback, you do have to subscribe to the ring premium service. And you have to have a subscription per device! I have it for my front door, not sure I’m gonna pay for the back door. That was kind of a bummer to find out I’d have to pay more. It should be a household subscription.Overall, I’m very happy with the device and would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to install solution without wires.",,We have this camera for the backyard and also the ring doorbell for the front door. We got the doorbell first and think it does the job. It is not the best nor is it the worst. Now the camera for the backyard is very nice. We got it as a safety precaution because we felt someone had used the pool while we were away and did not want that to be a safety issue. As you can see in these live pictures I just took that it covers pretty much the whole yard and you can zoom into areas on the app with your finger. Also pictured. We have the sensor set Just right to capture the movement in the backyard. At night when motion is detected the lights fire up to record. There is also an option to push an alarm on the light. It’s not super loud but loud enough for the neighbors to hear and scare persons away. I have also included a screenshot of the app view of the ring items we have.I would recommend this camera but really recommend using the solar panel with the camera and not have to worry about taking the battery out to charge it.,"Love the freedom of wireless, the solar panels work great and only need a couple of hours of sunlight per day to keep the batteries topped off.

I would buy this again and would recommend it to a friend",Just amazing!! Worth every penny! See full review.,Can see who is at your front door at all times day or night.,"UPDATE:7-24-2019:I have upgraded my review to 5 stars.You can see my complete video review on YouTube. Search for ""CASACAM WIRELESS"" in the search bar.You will find 3 videos to view.1. After communicating with the manufacturer they have explained to me that the plastic housing is UV rated.2. It is normal for the camera to feel warm to the touch.3. After having the camera for several days. I have discovered that this system is feature packed with many options to enhance the cameras performance.4. Video quality is very good5. Customer service is excellent.Two Camera Night Vision CasaCam, (this is the system without the extra spotlight).My first impressions: THE CAMERA:1. The camera material feels cheaply constructed. It is plastic no metal or aluminum.2. The lens cover is plastic not glass and is most likely susceptible to scratches and probably yellowing with age (like car headlight covers).3. The infrared L.E.D.’s on the front of the camera (they turn red at night) look poorly soldered.4. The camera is warm to the touch when on (day or night). I don’t know if this is normal.5. The power cord with the supplied extension cable for each camera is about 16 feet long. Not long enough for most installations. They charge $10.99 for additional 15 feet of extension cable.6. They claim the camera is “WEATHERPROOF” but should not be exposed to rain. It is probably fine mounted under an overhang or eave. They should consider making a rain/weather shield.7. The mounting bracket is adjustable but would be much better if it were a ball and socket.8. The instruction manual is better than I expected but is not clear on every function of the camera system. It wouldn’t hurt if they used a larger font.The MONITOR:1. The monitor feels nice with a little weight to it. It should be 10 inches for a better viewing of 2 or more cameras in split screen mode.2. The kick stand on the back is a nice feature but it feels flimsy and will probably break with a little pressure.3. The screen is a touch screen and responds okay but is a little awkward if you don’t get your finger in the right spot (make sure you remove the protective film or it will not perform well at all).4. The menu bar is pretty straight forward and simple. It is easy to figure out once you have played with the system for a few minutes.5. The monitor can be unplugged and carried around. This is a very nice feature. The battery life varies according to reviews I have read. I have used it for about an hour and a half with some charge still available.The Video:1. The daytime video quality is not bad at all. You will be able to recognize someone standing at your front door etc. You will see cars driving up and down the street. You will not be able to read a license plate (unless the license plate is right in front of the camera).2. The motion detection works and is adjustable and can be turned off.3. The night time video is acceptable. It is in black and white (it makes my blue eyes look very creepy) and you may not be able to recognize someone so easily.4. The two way speaker works, but is not as good as I had hoped. It is tinny sounding and there is a lag between talking and listening. You have to press the talk button while talking and release to listen. The playback sound on the video seems to be much better quality than the live audio.5. The SD card is over writable. For best playback I put the SD card in my computer where I have more control over the playback options.6. Internet connection. I am not using that option at this time so I have no comments.BOTTOM LINE:It’s not a bad camera system. The video is very good especially in the day time. The camera system has features for recording times and alarms. The portability of the monitor is an excellent feature. I wish the camera was constructed better. I can’t help but wonder about the longevity of this camera. From all the negative reviews I have read on Amazon the manufacturer has responded to most trying to work with their customers to resolve any issues that have arisen which makes me feel like this is a good company and improvements will hopefully be in the near future. Of course I have already spent my money on a product that for now seems to work very well.","I absolutely Love this camera system! We had been looking for one for forever and tried three other camera’s before we finally found this one! Where we live they don’t have WiFi that works very well so I wanted to get one that didn’t require WiFi and came with a non stationary monitor. I was using them as a kid and dog cameras so I wanted to be able to have two way communication with them as well. This camera fit All my requirements! The two way communication works amazing, the monitor can be carried around without being plugged in (although it doesn’t last very long, only about 4 hours but it also charges back up quickly), it can be plugged into the internet so you can view remotely from your phone, it’s So affordable compared to others, you can add cameras to it, it’s weather resistant, night vision is clear and amazing, saves footage so I can go back and review clips, I haven’t ever had a problem with slow connection and we have a camera outside and in our basement. If I could give it more stars I would! I did my research, tried other more popular cameras but this one was by far my favorite out of all of them! I haven’t had to deal with the company so far because I haven’t had any problems so I don’t really know how their customer service is but I guess that’s a good thing! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!","Exactly what I wanted. This is a nice simple affordable camera system that DOES NOT require wifi, a router or internet to work. Setup is simple, camera's are good, monitor is good, recording of video works as expected. night vision is decent, motion detection works but is not very long range and the audio (one way or two way) is good. Once you download the app to your phone and connect the monitor to your router you can view the camera's remotely, your results viewing the camera remotely will depend on the quality of your internet connection on both ends (camera end and cell phone end). Please understand this is a basic camera system quality of picture is average quality and features are adequate but somewhat limited. If you are looking for a high end feature rich video system this is not it! But if you are looking for a decent camera system with reasonable functionality I highly recommend this product. At this price point I don't think you can do much better. **Quick update** Have owned the product for six months now, It is in continuous use 24/7 One power adapter stopped working, Contacted the company by email and they promptly responded (less then 12 hours) and will send me a replacement no problems no issues. Things break, that's life but quality customer service like this is what makes a product stronger. very pleased!","Amazing product and amazing support!!This system is a must have, no WiFi is required which is what caught my eye. You can always use WiFi for remote viewing which is very secure and for dvr playback.Another plus is that the system can be incorporated with your RV trailer lights. Camera reads 9v, but after emails with the casa team 12v can also be used!! Which is very exciting because I can now use a rearview camera. (See con below)As for my other camera I use as a baby monitor in the buck house of the RV which has amazing video 2 way talking. So if I need to tell my little man to calm down or just to say I love you it works amazing and works great also with the remote app through WiFi.Con- as of right now for the camera settings, image can’t be reversed for the rear backup camera like I have setup. When you look at picture, left is really the right and right is really left if that makes sense. I am just really hoping they release a update to be able to reverse image.We plan on doing a full review on YouTube so more to follow on Gone with The Millers","Shipped fast and packaged very well. Easy too install and setup. No problem connecting too my router. Installed and formatted a128gb class 10 SD card with no problems. The picture quality is excellent and with the monitor being very portable, can use it in any room in the house. A very good security camera system at a great price. Very clear video with the night vision. You can have up too four cameras connected to the monitor at all times.

They stayed on the phone until I was ...,I really like this camera system,Very Nice System,"I had a ""4pcs 960P Cams+8CH 960P NVR(No HDD)"" unit for about one week. So far so good. The following is my experience:1. Good price.2. Very quiet NVR. I can barely hear any noise from the NVR in any room. I think it is because the NVR doesn't have a fan - not sure it is good or bad.3. Good video quality during daytime and night.4. Setup is easy. Cameras were already linked to the NVR once I received it.5. Robust remote view app on mobile devices - though its user interface could be better (see below).6. Great customer service - Daisy helped me over the phone for a few issues (see below). She even called me back and left me a few voice messages to make sure I am satisfied. Much appreciated!Now for the areas which could be improved:A. It takes 3.5 inch hard drives. I bought a NVR without a hard drive because I have an spare 1T 2.5 inch hard drive from my old laptop - that will save me about $50. After I opened the NVR to install the hard drive, I found the 4 pre-drilled holes don't fit my 2.5 inch hard drive. I was disappointed because the description on Amazon says: (4TB HDD Max can be supported: Internal, SATA Interface, 3.5/2.5inches). I read the manual (operation guide). It says ""Please purchase HDD (SATA 3.5"")"" (on page 06). Luckily the wiring works. So I just used one screw to install my 2.5 inch hard drive. The NVR has lots of empty space in the box. I would suggest make room for both 2.5"" and 3.5"" hard drives.B. The camera antenna can be attached to the left side of the camera only. This causes some problems for me. It would be nice if the antenna can be attached to either side of the camera.C. No dome camera is available for this kit. I would like to add one dome (or fish eye) camera to the system. Unfortunately they don't make it.D. The first time I connect the NVR to the TV in my family room with HDMI cable, the TV shows ""Mode Not Supported"". I called the customer service. Daisy gave me some tips to trouble shoot the issue: use a VGA cable or a different TV. I followed her advice. VGA cable and another TV all work fine. So that means the TV in my family room might not be compatible with this NVR.E. One camera's signal was on and off. Daisy pointed out that camera might be too far from the NVR or there might be too many walls between the camera and the NVR. She patiently went through the ""repeater"" setup procedure with me on the phone. Basically, a camera (with good signals) close to both the problematic camera and NVR was setup as a repeater to take the signal from the problematic camera then pass it to the NVR. It fixed the problem. Thanks, Daisy.F. The camera's base is too small. A little bit bigger base will make the camera more stable.G. There are 3 or 4 screws to adjust the camera's angle and position. They are not well designed.H. The remote view app on mobile device, Danale, is solid. However, the user face has room to improve. For example, in one camera view mode, swipe to left or right should show the previous or next camera.I. During the setup, I was asked to provide the password for my home wifi. I was very hesitate to provide my password though I did it eventually. Anyone knows if this poses a security risk?This wireless surveillance system is very good considering its price. I will upload some pictures and report back in a few months.","In researching a wi-fi only camera system, I purchased four systems on Amazon, and returned three and kept this one. I purchased systems from OnWOTE, HISEEU, Firstrend, and Canavis. If you are shopping for a wi-fi security system with a good image, and great wifi reception, which is critical to the system working properly, this system from Firstrend is your best bet related to cost, and as others have mentioned the customer service.I will briefing describe the issues with the other systems, this is based on my opinion and the operation of the systems based on where we needed the cameras and systems to be placed. The OnWOTE system had just average picture quality, and not good night vision at all. In addition I would loose connectivity with cameras often. The HiSeeu system was OK, but I have a power supply fail repeatedly and contacted customer support via email. Johnny replied and agreed to ship a new power supply to me. He sent me an email showing a shipment notification, but almost one month after that email I have never received anything. With the power supply failing, and lack luster customer service that system was returned. The Canavis system had the best picture quality and the worst reception range for the cameras. I wanted to like and keep the Canavis system, but the dropping of the connection and the slow transfer rates resulted in the return of this system as well. Yes I know, I could have purchased a wi-fi range extender to improve the reception, but WHY should I have to do that. I am not looking for a mile of connectivity just a normal two story home. And if I am spending $200 on the system, it should just work out of the box. The Firstrend system has a great picture and good night vision. One of the best parts is the connectivity of the system. I am getting excellent signal transmission on the unit and cameras, from the same locations the other units were failing. I did have one issue and that was one of the camera was great in the daytime, but at night the image was foggy almost like it had condensation behind the lens of the camera. So I contacted customer support via email, and received an email back within one day. They asked a few trouble shooting questions, normal stuff, and agreed to send me a new camera. That was great customer service. Within a few days the new camera arrived, and I could not add it to my system following the instructions that were sent via email with the shipment notification. So I found a phone number for Firstrend, 888-806-1588 called the number left a voice message, and sent an email as well. The instructions they sent appeared to be for a different system due to the menu configuration. Within one day, I received a phone call from an international number, it was Firstrend. Wow, they did return my call. During the call the nice lady discussed with me my situation about not being able to add the new camera to my system. She researched my order, and the camera they sent me to replace it. She discovered the new camera was not compatible with the system I purchased. She promptly stated she was sending me a new camera for my system, and for me to keep the camera that had sent in error. I asked how long would the new camera take, and she added priority shipping at no charge as well. So that evening I received an email from Firstrend with a screenshot of the order being placed for a new camera and 2 day shipping. So I really could not ask for much more customer service than that. I have had the system up and running for over two weeks now and really can't stress enough that the reception range on this system and the cameras is very good. I had to adjust the direction of the antennas on the cameras for maximum throughput, but it is running well.So in conclusion, for the money, the Firstrend system is great - and the customer service is outstanding. I am hoping the system lasts for a couple of years, so we will see.Take care,",Easiest setup ever. I actually returned a zmodo camera system that was way too difficult. The support for firstrend is the greatest. They stayed on the phone until I was finished setting up the system. I love these guys.,"I really like this camera system, it has easy installation, clear videos, good price, etc. I highly recommend this camera to anyone who needs a security camera system.","I purchased the Firstrend Camera System with 4 cameras and no hard drive. The instructions were simple and the cameras linked up with the NVR as soon as I turned on the system. However, due to my own error, two cameras subsequently disconnected from the NVR, and I was very discouraged for about 24 hours. However, the Firstrend support is very good. Owen returned my call and emailed me some instructions that fixed the problem immediately.The wireless signal strength is good--I have one camera that is located one floor above and about 35 feet away from the NVR, and it syncs with the NVR flawlessly. However, if you should have a problem, Firstrend sells a signal booster that will likely fix the problem.The picture quality is outstanding and the infrared night vision is awesome--I can easily see 80 to 100 feet out. I installed a 1 terabyte hard drive in the NVR. It was easy to format and is large enough for my purposes.The Danale remote view software is excellent. It will be nice to visually check in on our home when we are away.All in all, a very good system at an economical price.",2205,966,https://www.amazon.com/Newest-Wireless-Security-Camera-Firstrend/dp/B077HT7P5Q/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=defender+security+camera&qid=1640229566&sr=8-15

Also the camera has a much better picture if HD is pushed on the camera settings. Wifi is necessary if you need to access the camera remotely. You cannot go wrong with the purchase of this camera, the quality of the pictures is excellent and the response time of the camera to record is excellent.","This camera is a HUGE upgrade from the older one that I have from the same company. The video is more clear and the wi-fi extender is EXCELLENT! I have a slower internet and the extender is very nice - no freezing up or slowing down. Being able to move the camera around is an awesome improvement too, keeps me from having to install multiple cameras. It was very easy to connect with their app and set everything up, maybe 10-15 minutes (mainly because after connecting it needs to download a firmware update.) Even installing it outside was super easy, four screws to your base and then put camera on it and tighten down with little screw tabs. If you are looking for a camera but not wanting a huge investment or complicated installation, this one is perfect for that! I highly recommend it!","- Design, build and paint quality is excellent- Since our side patio, yard & walk in area is very narrow and long, the camera can pan the whole side of the house. It also can pan straight down to alleviate any blind spots.- If someone comes to our side entry door we can pan to see who it is and use the speaker (two way speaker) to ask any questions before deciding whether we should open the door. Of course it's also great to see if Amazon or other vendor packages have been delivered. (Panning is done through the use of an icon on your mobile device)- Battery life is very good. In 3 weeks of use the battery is at 85%. (I intentionally left off the solar panel to make sure the battery was good.)- I did encounter one minor problem involving still images not being viewable after the camera detected motion and recorded video. The company was contacted via email and within 24 hours asked for more information. After giving them the info, they responded again within 24 hours with their explanation. (Nothing wrong with the camera … a software app update will be upcoming which should fix the issue.) After working in the computer support area all of my life, I am always impressed by companies which actually care about customers and respond quickly. Kudos to their support team!This is a very nice and functional security camera which I would purchase again.","This come with everything you need, except for the optional memory card. Charge it before you install, and with the solar panel set up to face the sun, you never have to worry about it running out of battery. No monthly subscription required which I love. You can add a microSD card to save footage. The pan and tilt functions work nicely from the app which allows you to expand your view. Motion detection works a little too well, so I would get alerts if strong winds move plants/tree shadows. Overall a great value!",384,277,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Wireless-ieGeek-15000mAh-Detection/dp/B09BB33YS3/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=defender+security+camera&qid=1640229566&smid=A2V62WD6ULTN7P&sr=8-16

Hard to beat, especially at this price point!","Best camera for the money, hands down.","Great camera, easy app",Excellent product & Tech Support,"After much research for cameras for our house, I narrowed down my choice to this Zosi model for two primary reasons: the cost, and the many other overwhelmingly positive reviews. I had considered the wireless type of cameras available nowadays, but there were just too many reviews that mentioned lots of problems getting, and staying, connected, so I elected to go with the hard-wired video and power type. My thinking was that if the home wireless network goes down, or any camera's connection is unstable, then a wireless camera is useless. I purchased four of these cameras, so far, in April and May of 2017. I've installed three of them outside and they have performed flawlessly, rain or shine, since installation. I used the gray 3/4-inch PVC conduit and weatherproof gray PVC 4-inch round light boxes camera mounting. I drilled a 1/2-inch hole in the center of the box's cover for the cable to go into the box. I used flat head stainless steel machine screws to attach them to the covers, with silicone sealant applied to the screw holes for weatherproofing, and the same sealant around the bracket's edge for weatherproofing the bracket. It was a nice, clean, installation, with plenty of room inside those 4-inch boxes to roll up the connections. The picture included shows two of the three cameras in place. One of the four cameras I purchased has remained inside our house and is in use in our basement until it's permanent spot is ready for mounting. The camera's night vision range is excellent, but it's even better when there are reflective surfaces (sheds, lattice, etc) for the infrared to bounce off of. The video (both day and night) is very clean and crisp, and the best part is these don't cost 5 to 8 time more like the other cameras I looked at initially!! I have a UPS power backup for the system in the event power drops out. The cameras are being recorded 24/7. To add to all this, I recently installed an additional ""entertainment system"" consisting of 4-agile TV modulators (professional style) I purchased on that well known auction site (starts with an E) for very little $$$s each, fed by the camera's video, with their RF outputs combined to allow a single coax with 4-TV channels to connect to our 65-inch Smart TV's ""TV"" antenna input in our Master Bedroom. This gives us very LARGE pictures to look at of our property, and watch the Raccoons come and go, too, when there's nothing worthwhile to watch on cable TV. I did have one issue that came up with one of the four cameras within the last week. It's front ""lens"" (or glass) has fogged-up on the inside, for some reason, so I contacted Zosi Customer Service direct since I was beyond Amazon's return time frame. Zosi's handling of the issue has been absolutely fast and fantastic - best customer service I've received from ANY vendor in a long time. Special thanks goes out to ""Anran"" of Zosi Customer Service for the speedy resolution!! IMHO, these cameras are worth every dollar spent, and Zosi's Customer Support is superb!! What more could you ask for!!",,"You can't buy a better camera for $20. I replaced one of my zmodo kit cameras with this, and it puts the rest of them to shame.Something to note: the viewing angle is significantly wider than my original cameras, if you're looking for a zoom camera this is not it. See the picture below, the 2 cameras are mounted in the exact same location.","I bought this camera to use instead of a doorbell cam. Since my doorbell isn’t wired, I couldn’t install one. I love this camera! Setup is easy with the quick start guide they include. The app is really easy to navigate also. I see one small problem, but not for me. It is mounted in a low light hallway, so when the sun is shining brightly, the small part of my screen where it shines is washed out. Just white. I am not using it, however, to watch what is going on downstairs, but to see who is at my door and be able to talk to them. This is awesome for that. The rest of the screen is perfect: great picture!During installation, the guide tells you that if an SD card isn’t installed at that time, the camera will be unable to read it. This is false. I put my card in a few days later, the app told me it was not formatted, but within the app,easily, it will format it. The SD card works fine! You don’t have to use an SD card as it utilizes Cloud, but after 30 days there is a charge for that. With the card installed, you can turn off Cloud.Motion detection is very good although it’s a second or two behind. But you can tap on the alert, and it takes you to the moment of detection in a screenshot.Night vision is really very good, even though I don’t need it. The only difference in quality you can see is that it’s in black and white instead of full color. Daytime is great! It shows colors correctly, clear view of people and faces.Audio I can’t say enough about. I keep the speaker on so I can listen and talk to someone. To speak to someone outside, simply tap and hold the “intercom”, or the Mic icon on the screen. It just couldn’t be any easier.While I can not install anything to our walls (outside the condo) with screws, or anything that penetrates the wall, the adhesive works okay. If it falls, I will reinforce the bond with gorilla glue (found here on Amazon). I am using the magnet mount myself, but either mount is fine.Overall I give this 5 stars, even with the couple of minor things I mentioned. I think, if the camera is not in a low light area, there would be no problem having an awesome picture. This is a great camera for what I need and want, and the price is affordable. I would recommend this for both indoor and outdoor use.Update/3 months later:Everything I said about this camera still holds true, except for one thing. Time before last the camera was on the charger for an entire day and night.. about 20-24 hrs. The camera lasted almost 7 weeks between charges! This time I did the same thing, and on the 5th day it shows at still 100% charge.Update: I’ve been using the camera a while now, and this update is about the battery life.so I discovered, by accident, that when I start charging the battery in the afternoon or earlier, if I leave it on the charger overnight, the battery lasts longer. The first time I fell asleep and it was charging all night. That time I got 6 or 7 weeks. I did that again 8 weeks ago, and it is still at 10%. Now I let it run until it shuts off too, but don’t know if that makes a difference. But yes, I would give this a 6th star but f I could.",,2845,867,https://www.amazon.com/ZOSI-Surveillance-Weatherproof-Security-Infrared/dp/B00J21DFGE/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=defender+security+camera&qid=1640229566&sr=8-18

I was researching which surveillance system to buy, first my attention was captured by Google Nest cameras system, however, I realized there was a subscription fee which I really don't want to pay. I found this surveillance system 2 weeks ago and ordered. Last week it arrived and Install it in the backyard, front yard and in the, and even one camera left to install somewhere, so I installed it in the kids' room. The quality of the video in the night is pretty good. First I was under impression that 1TB of space wouldn't be enough, but then I realized it's for a week of the video recording, Also as you can see in the photo the hard drive is pretty standard if you want to increase the space you can just buy another hard drive in Best Buy, but I doubt you will ever need more than 1TB. Make sure you read the instruction first, it's also very important where you install the cameras, make sure it's not under the direct sunlight since it reduces the lifespan of the camera.",I bought this security system for our house and property..My wife is sick battling brain cancer.We head to hospital 200 miles every week.

Record all the time, playback anytime, all from a monitor using a mouse. Anything more expensive than this is not worth it. The hard drive that came with the unit was defective, but customer service was lightning fast and sent me a new one.Pros:-records at least 1080p-night vision was really clear at night. Could see what the human eye can’t see-customer service was quick and to the point-cables were longCons:-Navigating the interface was confusing and not intuitive-Software used to interact with the user, including computer program and phone app is outdated and often doesn’t work-Manual is lacking a lot of details-No indicator that lets me know the unit is recording, because of this, it took a fair amount of time to realize it wasn’t recording because the hard drive was defectiveTips for improvement:-The engineer should certainly revamp the interface by incorporating a basic mode/advance mode because a lot of the settings, I don’t know what they do, (I’m an IT admin, so I typically know what I’m doing)-Browser support is lacking for everything except Internet Explorer which is at its end of life. I can’t access the unit using macOS. A wide variety of stable and secure support would be nice.- the manual should have more details, like what certain icon represents. When I click certain things, icons just show up and i don’t know what the unit is doing-they should do away with the mouse for cost savings. A cheap wi-fi mouse I bought for this was more convenient to use than the wired one.If you own a small, hole in the wall business, who just wants a simple security cam set connected to a nearby dedicated monitor that records all the time, then this is the device for you. If you are someone who’s tech savvy, want to remotely access the cam feeds, or do some neat, efficient and auto features, this is not for you.","I bought this security camera system for my new restaurant. Before I bought it, I researched online about security camera system. Finally, I got this. I followed instructions to setup cameras. But it took my a little bit long time. Cause this is my first time to buy this type camera system. There has four cameras. I need to install on the wall for four different places. Then connect them together. It lets me work so hard. This system needs a monitor or I can use app to watch anytime. The best benefit is that they include 1TB memory disc. That’s why I bought it. Just don’t need to buy extra memory items. It’s easy to record with setting in the monitor correctly. Usually I watched its app everyday. I can see clearly. It’s good choice to my restaurant. Don’t regret to buy it. It works for me.","Very nice set of CCTV cameras, so my story for getting security cameras is my next door was robbed, so I'm scared what my house will be happening if I don't take some kinda actions. Saw it on Amazon and purchased for a great deal, so far it look amazing. The images are clear and it captures everything. I Will just list the pro and cons about this product.Pro: 1) It is clear 1080p, but in the settings you can pick from 720 - 1080 p, but it can goes to 2080 p too.2) motion sensor and night vision (black and white not green).3) cameras are easy to set up and it looks great.4) enough HD space to record all day.5) Will made, it is not plastic like other cameras, it is metal construction and it has some weights to it. Which I like.Con: 1) even though it is easy to setup, the instructions in the software is some time confusing. You have to spend some time to play with the settings.2) You have to have at lest 3 electric open plugs for this device. One for the monitor, one for the cameras, and one for the motherboard inside. So get ready 3 open plug spot or extension cord.3) Once it is on you can't turn it off, there is no off button. Not sure if this is good or bad.Overall, it is a great buy for it's price,it show clear images and great features, and hope to keep away the robbers thinking of breaking in. Give it a try.Thanks for reading.",2890,440,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Outdoor-Pre-Install-Recorder-Surveillance/dp/B07MZQ7HR2/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=defender+security+camera&qid=1640229566&smid=A3YLPDA5EV6UH&sr=8-13

Thanks HISEEU.Sincerely Ross","this is one of , if not ""the"" easiest to set up camera system you can purchase.I have also added 2 cameras that are fairly new to this company, has 2 way speaker ..the cameras are good and clear, customer support is top notch.I do recommend the wifi extender, it greatly increased the signal strength for those camerasa bit out of range. the day and night vision is excellent.I highly recommend this system.I have 7 cameras currently in use, I've also am using 2 Wi-Fi repeaters that are working great.I've not had a dropped connection in a long time. These are great, though they can takea bit of learning curve as you add on and use repeaters.",,"I bought this 8 ch. wireless system and installed it for a friend of mine. I was very impressed with the picture quality and ease of the setup. I have a system at my home and it's a professional quality and name brand and does not have the quality pictures as this Hiseeu system. I posted pictures I took from his monitor. These pictures are without a wifi hookup, just from the outside transmission from the cameras to the main unit. Before I installed this system I tested it at my hose to make sure it worked properly and it passed with flying colors. My home is about 3800 sq. feet and of course the cameras on the first level worked fine as being the closest, and to test it further I placed two other cameras as far as I could on the lower level and closed all the doors. Again all cameras produced sharp detailed pictures. I am not a professional installer, however I did install my 16 camera system and am very glad I suggested the Hiseeu system","I bought the DVR with 4 wifi cameras and I really liked the quality of the product, the excellent support provided by johnny and the support provided. The quality of the images is amazing as is the resolution of the device. It was the best investment for my house and the safety of my family, after all, at any time or I can see the images of my house.

The pictures are super clear on the 10 inch monitor that came with it and also super clear on my cell phone. Not just clear pictures on day times but also super clear at night time. You can see very detail with the night vision on your cell phone 20/20. The 2 security camera set I bought before can not get this clear pictures at all. The videos is recorded 24/7 and You can also roll back the video to see everything that’s going on from previous times of the day. Very easy self install that any one can do and super easy to set up on the monitor and on your phone by reading the direction manual that came with it. I bought it almost a month now and so far it’s running excellent. I would recommend it to everyone. Worth every dollar!! I have had taken some pictures of how clear all the pictures on the monitor and on my cell phone, on both day times and night times so you can see how clean all the pictures are. This is my first time ever written a review on Amazon so you gotta believe me! Thumbs up!!","I ordered this system and my neighbor said this is not what you want so I sent it back. He told me I need battery operated cameras so I decided to research this and battery operated systems. I wanted a no fuss system that did nor rely on I phones since I do not have one and did not want to change batteries. THIS IS THE SYSTEM I WANTED. It comes with 4 cameras and there is a step by step video on the product that is so helpful. The system has a one terabyte hard drive. I did not want anything hooked up to my computer but can be. I ending up buying two more cameras. The system will hold up to 8 cameras. The cameras have to have power but were very easy to install and as soon as the cameras received power, they were on my screen. I am loving the security. The cameras are a little over 900 dpi and are very clear. The night vision is in black and white and even catch all the bugs whizzing by.","This little cheap system was truly a plug and play system. There was no hard drive insertion or pairing cameras.There was no need, for me, to connect this to the cloud. I just plugged in the AC transformers and turned on the system.Then everything worked. The only thing that I had to do was to tell it the time and date. The pictures are clear and the night vision works. It has a lot of other features that I don't plan to use. It will record for 25 days before the disk is full and then it automatically records over the oldest date. Easy Breezy.....",Five stars across the board. The system came well-packaged. After opening all the boxes laying the components out it took me all of fifteen minutes to read the installation instructions. I found a location I wanted the home base plugged it in and was done with that part of it. It took me about two hours to install all four cameras and simply plug them in. When I got back inside the house all four cameras are online. It was that simple. Another 15 minutes to go through the settings and I was all done. Factory setting of clarity is absolutely beautiful and night vision is amazing. When an object moves through the viewing area of the camera it's absolutely perfectly smooth. My last system was very jerky and must have missed every 30 frames or so because an object magically moved 10 or 12 ft before you saw it again. I have mine again set at the factory settings of 24/7 recording. Playback of recording is absolutely excellent simply go to date and time stamp that you like and pick the track and watch what you want to watch. Extra little note is that if you unplug and move the base unit Andre plug it in the settings that you select time and date stamp etc are remembered so there must be a small power source within. This system has every option that makes any sense at all. I am extremely pleased with this product in ALL respects. My compliments to the manufacturers as this system as well thought-out well-engineered well-designed at a very fair price. I have absolutely no issues with workmanship or product materials. Having a background in engineering and QC I give this product and company an A+.,"I've had the 4 channel (wish I'd gotten the 8 channel!!) for about a year now. It was super simple to set up. Plug in the DVR and mount/plugin (or hard wire to dvr) the cameras...and they automatically pick up the signal and show up on the screen. Adjusting them is very easy. This system was designed to work great, be easy to set up, and give peace of mind. Yesterday, I was tnkering with the settings (not fully awake) and had a problem with one camera not working. I emailed Customer Service, and Cindy helped find my problem, sent a video of how to fix it, and 5 minutes later, all is well again. She is so nice, patient and knowledgable. I give the system and the csutomer service AAAAA+++++ and 5 Stars!!

It offers two options of image resolution: 360p and 2K. In my experience, the image quality of 2K is much better, and it does not have a significant delay even with the cell phone data plan instead of WIFI.In addition, I was surprised by its functionality of adjusting to different light conditions, as shown in these photos. Despite a strong light in the visible area, you can still see most part of the photo with enough information.The motion detection feature is also useful. Every time someone stepped on the porch (either get in the house or get out of the door), it will take a video with a few seconds, which is sufficient enough to see what happened. Although you do need to clean them up after a while, otherwise there will be more than 30 video clips per week :)This video camera offers many other functions. I still did not get some of them after using the camera for two weeks. It would be a good idea if it can provide detailed instruction to explain all the functions.","The Bosma EX Pro is a fantastic security camera that holds essential features. Motion detection, automatic light switch, 180-degree pan, night vision, and siren were some of the features that are a must in a security cam, and the Bosma EX Pro worked flawlessly. Linking the Bosma app from my mobile device was seamless and took me less than five minutes to get started.The camera is responsive to the app controls, and I didn't experience any delay when panning or applying changes. However, the app would be unresponsiveness at times, and this could be a hit or miss when catching a potential culprit. As a new outdoor camera out in the market, I assume the device and software will get better with time as firmware and app updates are released.It took a few days to get comfortable with the app and set up sweet spots for activity zones (detection spots). Overall, a great, sturdy security camera that will potentially handle all kinds of weather.","I purchased the 2021-Bosma Ex pro around 10 days ago, and right away put it to use !Once downloading the App, then Installing the camera and set up was much easy .There are different functions to choose with useful features in the setting. Motion detection is very accurate both day and night which also includes alarm. The camera indeed a good quality taking sharp pictures. Overall it's easy to install, operate , and works great as expected.","I am very impressed with the BOSMA EX PRO’s features for its price point. The camera was easy to install, the hardest part was choosing a spot. Holding the camera and just looking at it, it felt sturdy and well made. The set up process was as simple as it could be, a direct link to the app with step by step instructions. The range of vision that this camera is able to provide is amazing. I like how I am able to move the camera’s direction as needed with my app and the ability to track motion impressed me. I also really appreciate that in addition to motion detection, it is able to detect sounds - that’s a new feature I haven’t seen offered at this price before. The quality of the video is excellent and the interface is easy to navigate. Overall I look forward to what other products get released in the future, and I definitely would recommend to my friends and family.",I replaced my old outdoor cam with this Bosma EX Pro and used for over a week. Great experience and it provided much more security features than my previous one!Several things that I like:- Easy to set up. It came with hardware like screw and anchor. I just followed the instruction on the app and make connection easily.- Great picture clarity even when raining. It got a lot of rains in the past week and the camera is functioning perfectly in rain. The color night vision is also impressive.- Accurate person auto tracking. One of the main features that I choose to upgrade my old camera.I will recommend it to anyone who is interested to buy an outdoor cam.,40,22,https://www.amazon.com/EX-Security-Spotlight-Auto-Tracking-Detection/dp/B09HDMS683/ref=sr_1_17_sspa?keywords=defender+security+camera&qid=1640229566&sr=8-17-spons&psc=1&smid=A1G50FAL7V7HD2&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyRVJJRU80UFJTMFZYJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjkyMjQ5M0swVjdBUDFONU9CMiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNTQzNzMwTVJYOE5FNkRLNFpHJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

Now for the install (see picture). Got this far without cracking the manual and everything works (well at first it didn't, will explain). The hard drive arrives ""Unformatted"" and has to be formated before the NVR will start recording. Also, even after formatting the display was still showing ""not formated"", but after I exited ""System Setup"" and came back the drive was showing as formatted. How to format the drive: right click screen, go to system set up, HDD setup, on the far right is a box that says format, check the box and go to the bottom and click format, exit system setup and then go back in and check the HDD ""status""..What's in the box: four camera's (two pigtails: one power and one RJ45 network connector, antenna and mounts), one NVR (with 2 TB hard drive), one stiff HDMI cable with a nice braided covering (I'm guessing 5 feet long), optical mouse and manual.OK, fully installed and have had one issue: The IP install hit a snag. Snag solved, the manual says you must have WAN connector, this is poorly written, what they are saying: you must have Internet services for IP to work. I have an Actiontec FiOS router and it has two ""IN"" ports, coax cable or the WAN connector, those are input connectors and FiOS uses the coax, the WAN port is not used and cannot be used by other devices. I had a spare LAN port, plugged in the NVR and clicked on diagnostics and bingo, I am now connected ""Healthy Network"". Silly me, I took their description of using a WAN port literally.Update (8/20/2017), asked for and received the CMS software and it arrived right away (awesome support). Got the CMS working, happy I had the manual, the one page setup also sent Grace Hu worked ... but, not at first because I didn't know ... on the preview tab: on that page on the right side-bar you will see: Area & under Area your newly added Cloud ID you have Chanel 1 -4, you need to double-click on the cameras to turn them on for viewing (the camera icon will turn from gray to gold when turned on).","I compared this multi-camera surveillance system with other leading competitors. As a technical person, I reviewed its specifications in detail, and found it to be the best wireless system for protecting small or large homes.After completing its physical installation, I powered up the NVR, then the four cameras.. They paired up within a few minutes and displayed clear pictures on a 4K monitor.The new 13 page user manual (provided later) provides clear instructionsThe 2 TeraByte (TB) storage disk is sufficient for most applications, although larger internal disks can be obtained if extra-ordinary memory is required. For the unit described here, 2 TB was found sufficient to store 14 days of 24/7 operation when the frame rate is set to about 10 frames-per-second (fps), and with a high sensitivity setting. For two weeks of storage, I used about 1.75 TB.Using IP Pro (an Apple app), viewing on my iPhones was flawless, whether watching from the US or from Europe or from the UK.Backing up a time segment to a PC or to a thumb drive was easy.As an advice to fellow users, great care must be exersized in the evaluation of signal losses through building structures (walls, closets, windows,...).Camera output signal power is limited by law, and camera location and orientation are critical for both the NVR and the cameras. Solid brick walls are especially challenging, and some additional amplification may be required for certain installations. Do not allow the cameras to look directly into the sun: it will burn the sensitive optics.Concluding, the technical service and support provided by SMONET is excellent, especially when compared with other products, and the assistance provided by Mrs. Huang has been very helpful.","I bought this system to replace a lower resolution wireless system that I had installed on my house a while back. The DVR for that system became inoperative and the company no longer offers a model that would replace it. So I ordered this SMONET system and I am impressed with it so far. I bought it without the hard drive, as I have a couple of suitable drives handy.I have to say that customer service has been extremely proactive. Crystal from SMONET reached out to me proactively to ensure that I am satisfied with the product and to provide contact information should I ever need it. That is impressive!!!The system is impressive too. Since it is 8 channels where my previous DVR was only 4, I have more options. I was able to connect my existing lower res wireless cameras to this DVR and use those in addition to the 4 new hi-res cameras that came with it. My home has a relatively large footprint being a single story structure of 2700 square feet. All of the cameras manage to connect to the DVR with good signal except for one of the old ones that needed a ""repeater"" even in the old system. The great news - that repeater also works with the new system once everything is properly ""married"".I put a 1 Gig hard drive in mine and it could not have been simpler. Four screws to attach it and then a power cable and SATA cable to connect it. A quick format and it was up and running in minutes. I used a Western Digital drive but you can use a variety of drive sizes and manufacturers.Picture quality is noticeably better which I expected by going to full HD. Even the old low res cameras look pretty good. Motion detection is about the same as the previous system which was very good - so good, in fact, that I have to make sure the cameras are free from spiderwebs as their movement will trigger recording. LOL.The system is easy to set up and configure. Installation does require a power source near the camera but I used some power extension cables, that you can also get on Amazon, where I needed them. Night vision is remarkably good too with the IR illuminators on the cameras.For the price, this was an outstanding value when I ordered it. Now that I've got the hard drive installed so easily AND I was able to ""marry"" my old cameras to this system, it became an even better value.Thanks again, Crystal, for your proactive customer service!!","The selection process in a surveillance system can be challenging and the priorities vary with each user.My highest priority was CUSTOMER SUPPORT, and in an ever changing technological environment, this seller’s customer support, Betty Huang, exceeded all expectations. All issues were promptly responded to, professionally, courteously and with full transparencies!My next priority was COMPATIBILITY with my current hardware technology (High Def 1080P TV, Samsung Android phone, Windows 10 PC, Tablet and laptop) and this Wireless NVR Kit delivered.Next, HIGH DEFINITION video was a must and the camera’s delivered stunning auto focus day and night high definition resolutions.The system was for residential use, so I wanted WIRELESS eliminating unsightly cables like a bowl of spaghetti at the main station/monitoring location, which in my case was my office, and the wireless and surprisingly compact NVR system delivered.Last, which we all consider, was PRICE. The unit is competitively priced compared to current competition for all that it delivers and my second choice was less than $50 lower and it was hard wired and unknown customer support.","Back in December 2016, I purchased my first Smonet NVR that was a 4CH only. That thing has rocked every day since then. For the price and features, you couldn't beat it. I now find my self needing to add more cameras. I purchased this system since I had a 4TB HD already and four existing cameras that I wanted to add to this new system giving me 8 channels. The new system worked out of the box and these are 2MP 1080p cameras vs the 1.3 MP 960p cameras I already had. Now, this system I did not have any problem with as it came. The problem that I ran into was when I wanted to move the Cameras from the old system over to the new one via the match code process. I kept getting the invalid module error (-8) and the camera would not add. Now, working with computers for years now, I noticed that the old cameras had the same IP ranges 172.20.14.30 - .34 which the new system had already assigned to the cameras it came with. No matter if I deleted all cameras and added individually, they all seemed to have the wifi connection info and IP hardcoded inside the camera directly. This is where I was stumped. I wasn't sure how to access the cameras to correct this. I reached out to Smonet via email and they sent the steps needed to access the camera directly as well as the application to configure LAN (not wifi) since its plugged into my switch so I could access the web config page of the camera. Once I did that, I followed the steps on updating the WIFI SSID and passcode to the new NVR info as well as changing the IPs of the old cameras to be 172.20.14.35-38. Once I did this and saved, I did the match code process of the NVR system and BOOOOM! All the old 4 cameras connected easily and were up and running. While the support hours of Smonet are China Time Zone based and not really available for me during the day since I am on EST, they always responded to my emails and were very helpful. The person that assisted was named Crystal. Overall, I am a happy customer and will continue to use their products since typically you can't beat the price. This system for 159 was a good deal as it would have cost me that much just for 4 cameras basically at the going rate of ~35$. So it was a no brainer to go with this setup for the cameras and NVR. The only thing is, I wish I could swap out the antennas on the cameras. My old ones you can, but these seem to have the wire running from inside the camera out to the antenna so you would have to open the camera to replace..

It’s frustrating because most outlets are not near high ceilings or places you would put a camera . So although it lives up to the hype and is truly a GOOD PRODUCT these pictures should be reported for false advertising.","So far so good. We've been using Yi products for a while, but have had some issues with them lately. We hooked these up today and they are just as easy to setup as the Yi cameras. The video is crisp and the audio is clean. I give them 5 stars and will be ordering more once these have stood the test of time for a bit longer.Update: 12/12/20I've been using these for a little bit now and they are so much better than the Yi cameras I used to have. One of the biggest perks is that they do not require that you subscribe to their cloud service in order to view multiple cameras on the screen. Only draw back to these is that they don't have a Windows app to view cameras. Only android and iPhone. However, you download the Blue Stack emulator for windows and it's like having an Android on your windows desktop. These cameras are perfect! Everything about them is so much better than the Yi.","We got these with the vague idea that we could monitor our kiddo and babysitters while out on date night. But with Covid, date night is a thing of the past. Let's hope I'll need these more in the future.I installed them already and actually I've really enjoyed being able to monitor different rooms in my house from my phone. It's nice that you can see the feed from every camera on one screen, or just do one at a time so you can see more detail. The picture is pretty good, clear enough that you can tell what's going on. Sometimes I use them to see how my daughter and husband are doing when I'm at the grocery store, or just to see which room my daughter is in and whether she's making a mess, but that's about it so far. Hoping to get more use out of them in the covid-free future. Anyway, for the price, you really can't beat these.","My husband and I just moved to a much larger city than we are accustomed to and bought this for our own practice of mind when our teenager is home alone. I didn’t expect much since the product was so cheap but let me tell you I was blown away with what I received! The picture quality is much better than expected, the sound quality with speaking through them is great, and the night vision works like a dream! I was expecting them to have cords from reading the reviews and those are the only downside! They are a little short but super easy to hide and extensions aren’t expensive to purchase!

After all, you get what you pay for right? Not here….you get way more than you pay for. This drone packs feature that others don’t have at twice the price. The X300 comes with 2 batteries; the battery seems to go much longer than other drones. I think I got around 50 minutes of flying (25 minute per battery). Charge time is 1-2 hours per battery depending on the wattage of your plug. The remote is fantastic that comes with it. You can use it with or without your smart phone as the remote has an attachment arm that cradles your smart device for full screen action mode. The drone hovers at whatever height you set it to and you can take your hands off the control and it will sit stationary at the height the last input you gave it. So if you end up in a panic pilot situation, just let your thumbs off the joystick and it will stop in space. A feature that saves you from avoiding crashes and damage. On windy days, the trim is easy to adjust as well. So if you want to hover and the drone is blowing downwind, just push in the joystick and fly it against the wind for a second and you’re hovering in one spot. It’s that simple to tune it in any conditions. The input and responsiveness are spot on as well. Many drones in this price point will take a second or two to react to inputs instantly making the X300 an incredibly fun flying experience. One of the greatest features is a single button “return to earth feature.” Just hit the button once and the X300 drone descends to earth and pauses millimeters above the ground before a gentle touchdown. I highly recommend this as a trainer drone to stepping into more expensive models when you want to progress into more advanced features which come at a high price tag. Fly this for a couple of weeks and you’ll be glad you have the experience and confidence I gained immediately from my maiden flight. I plan to step up the SYMA X500 that a friend is flying now that I understand the basics of flight control. This will always be in my quiver for flying fun and for teaching new pilots the exciting world of remote drone flying. You won’t find a better drone in that “under $100 price point.”","Disclaimer: I own a DJI Mavic Pro, and started out with a Holy Stone quadcopter. I've flown smaller ones like the DJI Spark, which is similar in size. I would say that for the price, this is a five-star drone. You get a lot for $80.Pros:Small manageable size - the drone is large enough to make it feel like a nice machine, but small enough, especially when folded, to port around, which is nice because it lends itself to easy travel. You can also easily launch it and land it from and on your hand.Robust and reasonably crash proof - The blade guards seemed kind of flimsy, and didn’t stay on well, so I flew without them. The drone handled test crashes well. The propellers held up well, with only some minor scrapes after hitting the ground and nearby trees. The copter simply hit the ground and the arms folded in on impact.Quiet - The drone has a relatively quiet sound, and isn't too loud. I could talk to those next to me while flying without having to raise my voice while the copter was only a few feet away.Auto-flip function - This is fun. When executed, the drone flips in your specified direction, rolling quickly left, right, forward or backward and returning to hovering once completed. The flip function does not work once the battery drops below a certain percentage.LED lights for battery and connectivity - These are easy to see when on the ground and display info about the battery when charging or low, and connectivity when first powered on. The rear lights are green, and the ones in the front are red, but they can be hard to see in daylight once it gets more than about 30 feet away.Good range. I flew the drone about 70 or 80 feet away laterally without any problems, and about 40 feet up before coming down for fear of wind gusts. It worked fine, with no noticeable latency.Headless Mode - Great function for learning pilots, especially for a drone like this that has no camera feed. However, the instructions are quite confusing on how to engage this and it took me a solid 5 minutes of fiddling with the controls to get it to work. To get this to work, take off, hold the button at the top left of the controller until it starts beeping, and then push the stick forward. The forward-facing direction will remain that relative forward until this function is disengaged.Tuning - This was easy to do, and I liked the tactility of the joystick buttons. I found it worked well.Camera usability- The quality is good, and it is fun to use. However, I’m kind of in the middle on this, which is why the camera is in both the pros and cons. It does provide an accurate view of what the drone sees, and I didn’t have almost any lag. The picture resolution was nice. It’s not super easy to use, but I was able to figure out most of the controls while flying.Battery: This had a nice battery life, with about 22 minutes of battery life to 1.5 hours charging time. I didn’t stream video, which I would imagine uses a bit more battery, bt for my medium intensity flight, I was very happy with the flight time, especially considering that they give you two batteries, which could give you about 45 minutes of flight time.Cons:Unstable/Jerky Camera - Because the camera is hard-mounted to the drone body, the video is very twitchy and jerky as the drone flies around and tilts, particularly when descending. The video became very shaky. I found myself more inclined to use the photo option over the video though, because of how unstable it was. I also found the field of view to be frustratingly narrow, and wanted a more upwards view from the drone.Instructions aren't very clear - I found myself struggling to engage Headless mode, as well as set up the camera, one of the main selling points with this drone. I’ve found this is a common issue with Syma instructions, and it just makes the products a lot harder to use. There are occasional typos, and the layout is confusing.","This is a great drone to fly around in the backyard. The assembly is quick and easy (even without the instructions) and flight is smooth and controlled.Only tip I would give is.... use outside only.When I was putting the drone together, I started the engines and the drone flew around my living room like a drunken sparrow. People jumping and dodging and running for cover.....it was awesome.....I mean......bad.Buy this drone and have many hours of fun (it includes 2 batteries).",,"The SYMA X300 foldable Drone is very friendly to use, I called the tech support for the installation and he was very helpful.

Let me tell you I am one pleased grandma! I'm a newbie at flying drones. Right out of the package its a sleek looking drone. You will need to put on the blades and blade guards. The hardest part about that was holding those tiny little screws, lol. Batteries on reciever and drone charged, drone registered. Yes you have to register the drone with the FAA. Did it online, took 10 minutes and $5.00 and I had my numbers. Easy peasy. After following the calibration instructions the first flight went exceptionally well. The HS100 is responsive and very easy to fly. The follow me feature was a hoot. Almost like have a pet flying around following you.lol. And the RTH feature works very well. The drone comes to you very quickly stops near you and lands. Very cool indeed. The biggest reason my husband chose this drone was the camera. I have a small drone and the video is choppy at its best. Let me tell you what, the HS100's camera takes good pictures and decent video. I can actually use my VR headset with this drone and there's no choppiness! I absolutely LOVE the HS100. I have not found anything I don't like about this drone. Good quality drone that won't break the bank.","I’ve been in the RC flying Hobby for 40+ years. I have avoided Helicopters/Drones because they are notoriously known to be hard to setup, maintain and fly. The HS100 is an amazing EXCEPTION. Assembly, Setup and Flying is unbelievably EASY. The HS100 has many features that are in much more expensive drones. If you want to get into Helicopters and Drones this is the product to buy. The RTH (Return to Home) and Auto Takeoff and Land features get you into the air and back down on the ground very quickly, with little risk of crashing. The camera and SD Card worked better than I expected. The HS100 price is just right. Not too expensive for all the features you get and NOT so inexpensive that it is feature lacking. The HS100 is feature abundant!Some Recommendations:Read the instructions carefully and a number of times before doing anything.Inventory the parts carefully before assembling the Drone.(I couldn't find some washers which were stuck down deep inside the box which I finally found).Make sure everything is fully charged, HS100, Transmitter and your Cell Phone.Insure your WiFi is turned on in your cell phone.You can fly the drone without a cell phone, but using one gives you a lots of extra status information so you get the HS100 flying quickly.Install the propeller guards. Some people think they may not look that great. They work and it beats replacing props in the event of an oops.A Good Routine:Have a spotter with you on your first few flights.Check and recheck everything before your first flight.Make a Check List. The instruction manual has a very good first flight check list (Good Starting Point).DON’T fly if you see something wrong, FIX IT First!Buy an extra battery. 12 minutes is about average flying time.Some people complain that it's too short. Believe me, you have to concentrate on flying any RC model, 12 minutes is a long time.After flying, take a break, think about what happened and what you want to improve on.Take notes. Holy Stone provides a notebook (great idea). All good pilots use log books.Recharge the batteries then fly again (Drone & Transmitter).If you fly at a park with no power, you can get an inexpensive charger that runs off a 12v car outlet.Wether you fly full size aircraft or models, the rule is check and recheck to minimize something not setup correctly, thus avoiding the chance of a crash.When you are learning how to fly, the less distractions the better. Try to fly your first flight on a zero wind day (either early morning or in the evening when the wind is calm). The HS100 is very light, and very stable, so wind (if strong enough) can make the drone drift if you are not under GPS control.Remember: The HS100 has the auto controls so you can take off and land with almost no experience.However, if you want to start flying your drone far away and/or navigating around objects, you have to learn that the controls reverse as you change direction.When the Drone is flying away from you: the Left control turns the drone Left; the Right control turns the drone Right; This is from your view point to the drone.When the Drone is flying towards you Left control turns the drone to your Right, the Right control turns the drone to your Left. This is from your viewpoint to the drone.A real good thing to do is find a friend that has an RC flight Simulator so you can get the hang of flying an RC model if you never have flown one before. Simulators are not necessary, but they can help you master the controls without having to think about it. The more instinctively you can control the drone the less chance of a crash. Some hobby shops now offer using a Simulator for a few hours at a time. The more you practice, the better you will get at flying. No magic here, just practice!Once I got the hang of flying the HS100, I did a roof inspection on my house and my neighbors house which is a good use for Drones.Sorry for being so long winded. I wish I had someone giving me some tips so I could have avoided some of my oops. I hope my review will get people excited about flying and help them get into flying the HS100. The HS100 is an EXCELLENT product and a heck of a lot of FUN to fly!",,3981,2,https://www.amazon.com/Holy-Stone-Quadcopter-Adjustable-Intelligent/dp/B074YYVXQH/ref=sr_1_23?keywords=flying+ring+security+camera+drone&qid=1640229027&sr=8-23

(see video)The controller is easy to operate without taking your eyes off the quad. The display is very informative and clear so with a quick glance you know which of the 4 speed modes you are in, whether or not you are taking video.Your smartphone easy fits in the controller. I own an LG G4 and I had no problems.Four AA batteries are required and not included, but they are easy to insert with no need for a screwdriver.The battery: The HS110D only comes with one battery and is good for 10-15 minutes.As a newbie, you need a a wide-open space with grass or some other soft surface. It doesn't handle wind very well, so be careful. This is expected as it is a smaller drone.Make sure you snap the guards ALL the way in. It also includes two extra guards as well as a replacement for each propellor and replacement landing gear. The addition of landing gear to this design makes safe landings much easier than other quadcopters that have no landing gear.The card is easily removable, and Holy Stone included an adapter to plug it into your computer for transferring your videos to your computer.Customer service: My boyfriend had to contact Holy Stone for help with his first quad, but I can say their customer service is exceptional. They will go above and beyond to help you with any problems to make sure you are happy with your purchase.The only negatives to the HS110D: A second battery would be nice to have and watch out for wind!","The HS110D is an amazing camera drone. The app is completely different than the one I have for my other drone (HS160). It is so much better. The app for the HS110D is very clean an refined. Not to mention that there is a fairly accurate battery indicator inside of the app. When you are flying during the daytime and can’t see the lights on the drone, you will know when you have low battery. There is also a flip mode which is pretty cool for doing tricks, but seeing as this is mainly a camera drone I don’t see myself using that feature too much. The flip mode also serves a useful purpose as well as just for entertainment. Because the drone will not do flips when it is low battery, if you want to know when the drone is low battery you can just attempt a flip and the drone will not do it. The actual drone itself is pretty big, especially in comparison to some of the other Holy Stone drones that I own. It has three speed settings which is very useful because once you start flying the drone farther and farther away from you, it is difficult to determine the speed of the wind where the drone is. With multiple speed modes you can easily just kick up the speed to three and fight through the wind. The drone is strong enough that it will not be swept by the wind if you have it going fast enough. The camera on this drone (720p) is also really cool. I like the fact that it has the option to use the app and save the videos and photos directly to your phone, or save them to the included 4GB TF/microSD card. This is really useful since the drone app functions via wifi so since the wifi range is shorter than the transmitter range, you can fly it farther than the wifi and still capture excellent videos. The drone is also very stable. I really like the way it hovers in place. This is really useful because sometimes trying to take a shot of your family or something in front of a overlook is difficult. I’ve found that I can just fly the drone up a few feet and it will stay in place. Then, I just put the remote down as it takes the picture. The large indicator lights on the bottom are very useful, since they tell you multiple things. They tell you if the drone is connected to the transmitter, if the drone is on low battery, if the drone is in headless mode, and if the drone is flying without problems. The remote is amazing, simply one of the best drone remotes I have ever used. The small LED screen at the bottom with indicator lights is so useful as it tells you the status of your drone. For example, it tells you what speed you are on, whether or not you are in headless mode, if you are in flip mode, if the drone is connected. The controls and remote itself are very ergonomically designed which is essential for flying a drone. You don’t want to be worrying about the pain in your hand when you should be paying attention to the drone! Put simply, the remote is amazing. It is a very responsive drone and overall really great. I would totally recommend to a friend, especially at the price point.",,"Don't let the size or the price fool you. This drone is a blast! I have many different quadcopters from toy grade to professional grade. This is ""fun grade"". Appears to be well made and sturdy. Only have a few flights so far but this has exceeded my expectations by far.Video is clear and latency is almost non-existent. There are compression artifacts visible on saved videos but not really objectionable for fun/hobby use. It's certainly good enough for fun FPV flying.Drone was super stable and I had to remind myself that there was no GPS on this one. Popped it up in a hover and it just stayed there. Climbed to 30-40 meters and it just stayed there. Altitude hold worked perfectly. Just what you need for amateur aerial videos without having to constantly manage altitude.Flight time to low battery warning is about 10 minutes. Battery can be charged while in the aircraft with included micro-USB cable.The Holy Stone app for smartphone worked perfectly and takes only seconds to setup and start flying FPV.Everything was simple to understand and use. Very pleased with this purchase.About the only ""con"" I can think of is that the instruction manual was a little hard to find as it was hidden under the drone packaging in the box. When I found it, I found another little surprise gift of pocket notebook with pad, post-it notes and pen that was included.",,16268,2,https://www.amazon.com/Holy-Stone-Wide-Angle-Quadcopter-Altitude/dp/B078WKT1HL/ref=sr_1_26?keywords=flying+ring+security+camera+drone&qid=1640229027&sr=8-26

For both beginners or advanced drone pilots.,Great starter Hd Camera drone!,Good for beginers,,"The HS110G from Holy Stone came with a nice zipper carrying case with all the accessories needed, including 2 batteries and extra props. Startup was the same as the other drones, you have to pair the remote, calibrate the gyro, then register GPS signal. The initialization of this drone is probably the fastest I've seen yet, I was able to take off within 2 minutes of popping in the battery cartridge.With GPS locked in, the drone will maintain its location within roughly a square meter area, no matter the wind directions. I can't even deal with drones that don't have GPS anymore, it is a must-have feature. The camera mounted underneath is removable, but no adjustable positioning, the camera only points straight forward, but is wide-angle enough to catch almost any view.After a mix-up and a collision with a garden fence, the drone seemed to struggle maintaining balance during the next flight. I was concerned but then did a recalibration of the gyro and it performed much better, so it's important to remember to recalibrate during any hard landing or crash.Return to home seemed to behave differently, as most other drones rise up high to avoid obstacles, then navigate to home position, then drop down. This one maintained its current altitude, then slowly navigated and lowered to the starting point. This one has a unique button that can do an emergency power kill mid-flight. I didn't try it, but supposedly it will shut down the props and the unit just free-falls, perhaps a good safety-net with some of the reports of GPS flaking out in similar drone models and losing control of the drone.All in all this was a fun drone to play with and a good starter drone for the beginner!","I have a couple drones and other RC products. The Holy Stone HS110G stands out as one of the best I have flown. If you are interested in buying a drone or upgrading, please read this review. I will cover all the highlights of this drone. First, like some of the best products made, the packaging usually reflects the quality of the product. The HS110G comes in a perfect designed and well padded case for storage and transport. I actually have never seen a well designed case for an inexpensive product like this. It protects the drone, and is easy to keep things stored. I have considerable experience in the plastics industry. The HS110G drone is made from very durable quality plastic that can take an impact without breaking. The fit and finish is comparable to drones costing many times more. It is obviously engineered by a team that designs state of the art aesthetics with the best materials and functions. Both the controller and drone are robust. The controller has a great feel with a quality weight, not a cheap toy. So, how does it perform? I set it up first indoors. The instructions are clear and written with great visuals. I took extra care indoors. If this is your first drone, just tether the landing gear with string and a weight if you want to learn to hover and the controls. If outside just follow instructions and fly it. Easy! I took it outside with winds around 5 mpg with gusts, and flew it around the yard.Great Fun & Wow, stable and speeds adjusting from low to fast, for beginner to advanced. I really totally impressed. I went up to max saltitude and watched the sunsets and the next day sunrise. Very cool. I took a few images and videos. The camera resolution outperforms my other drones. Crisp and clear photo and video. Great to capture stunning vacation shots you could not get without a drone. I tested the follow me feature, auto take off and land, everything worked great. A real test is to see if a drone comes home if something unexpected happens. I sent the drone at high altitude towards the woods. It disappeared at great distance. I actually thought I lost it. A minute or so later it came right back and landed. I was totally amazed. So, if you want a high quality drone that is affordable, easy and fun to fly with a camera and all the needed features, the Holy Stone HS110G is the one to buy. For yourself, a loved one, or to give as a gift. You will be totally pleased. I hope this helps.

I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't. None. Not a single thing.It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways. I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed. Nope.I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house. Nope. There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not. They are not location aware in any way. The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording. Nope!The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours. Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room. I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on. This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%. This is with all the 'battery saving options' on. This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording. So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing. I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality. The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.***UPDATE***Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera. You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then. Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't. Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera. The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support. Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.***ANOTHER UPDATE***From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"". This will be a great update and should have been available on launch. I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.***ONE MORE UPDATE***Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days. It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration. With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set. They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away. For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off. You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc. Or any combination. The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can. This is a great improvement. They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5. This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras. I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.***LAST UPDATE***Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I've had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now. All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night. Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn't bad. I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it's pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation. They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you're thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them.","Before I start my revised review, let me state that there's been a lot of news lately about people hacking into Ring cameras, but this only happens when someone installs a new camera and doesn't update the default username and password (or has an extremely weak password which is easy for a hacker to guess). This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions.Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product.Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all.Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement.A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring.Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised.***UPDATE***Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices.Ring has now updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new wireless battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well.Observations.Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool.I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a few months before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent.I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once.Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete.I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic.Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.","Had the camera up and running in less than ten minutes. Excellent quality picture. Hooking up to the solar panel when installing, this way battery is always charged. Received mounting hardware, camera has been installed.",Installed 2 of these outside my house in about 20 minutes. Mounted one above my garage and the other near my front door. The video quality is pretty good. Not facial recognition software good but good enough for a good description of people if needed. I used the mounts that came will the camera and scanned the QR code for setup. Not sure why people couldn't set up zones. It is part of the setup unless you skip over the steps. I do agree with most reviews that the notifications are spotty. Took my trash out and the one by the garage only recorded me going to the side of the house and the one by the front door only recorded me coming back. A neighbor walked by this morning and it started recording after they walked by and were down the street. Pic attached. Went outside again and the both cameras picked me up as I would have expected. I will adjust the camera and reset the zones to see if that helps. They are my first Ring cameras so there may be fine tuning on my part that is needed. Will update this as the days go by.Windows 10 app logs me in but says I don't have any cameras set up. Tried on a PC and 2 laptops. Please fix!!Phone apps are pretty good so far. (Samsung note 9)Updating to 5 Stars.....After adjusting my zones and motion settings I was able to get the results I needed. At one point the wind blew leaves across my driveway and my sensor went off. After fine tuning I see no issues with the camera and its performance. It is by far better than other cameras I have purchase over the years and after comparing subscriptions from other companies $10 a month or $100 is a deal.,Don’t let any negative reviews influence your decision to buy these cameras. The negative reviews are from people who have not read the instructions or just have no idea how a security camera works. I monitor 16 security cameras where I work so I have a lot of experience with them. I bought the Ring Stick up camera and the solar charger for it as well. They both work great. I bought two more a week later. Now a month later I have no issues with battery power loss of any kind. Just set your zones to cover what you want. Don’t put motion sensor on full or you will catch bugs and falling leaves. I set my sensitivity in the middle. The image quality day and night is pretty good. You can also look at your cameras from a computer as well as your phone. You don’t need an Alexa to use these. The microphone works well too. Overall I would highly recommend these if you just read and understand the instructions and how they work which is very simple and easy.MD in SC 1-1-21,35984,1,https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Stick-Up-Cam-Battery-HD-security-camera-with-two-way-talk-Works-with-Alexa-/dp/B07Q6ZZFLS/ref=sr_1_25?keywords=flying+ring+security+camera+drone&qid=1640229027&sr=8-25

Good price and quality!,Excellent Drone!  Love the camera and video quality!,"Great drone, great price.",I real drone not a toy- but easy to operate in begginer mode,"The HS 700E is at the top of the market in this price point. It is built solid and fly's very well. You will need to register with FAA via the drone zone due to it being over 250 grams. It comes with two sets of quick change propellers, that's right, no screws here, two batteries, controller and a soft case with foam insert for all the above to keep them safe. You can fly this via GPS with with or without a phone or tablet. If you want to fly first person view and use all the additional features via the Ophelia Go app you will need a phone or tablet that is capable of connecting to the drones 5G wi-Fi network. The controller connects to the drone via 2.4 ghz. 400 feet high is the limit in the USA and you will have no issue reaching that. In my testing I can get out about 500 to 600 feet distant at 400 ft altitude before losing video connection, your phone may be different. Its definitely far enough to get some great still shots or 4k video. The drone accepts up to a 128gb Micro SD card. I have a hard time getting the sd card out of the slot without using tweezers due to it laying flat against the body surface but not a big issue. With GPS locked the drone holds position very well even in 15mph wind and the Electronic Stabilization does a pretty good job of keeping the shake to a minimum. Without a camera gimble you will see the horizon tilt if the drone is tilted by the wind. Picture quality is pretty darn good at this price point. You can control the cameras up and down motion from the remote control but I wish it moved a little slower and precisely. It has a return to home feature that worked every time I tried it. This is a great feature if you lose connection with the drone. Pre-flight set your RTH altitude to get over the highest object in your area, and up and back it will come. Like I said this drone is solid. It doesn't have the foldable arms that break when you crash. I pushed it a few times and hit some metal poles. I dented a few props but the drone is unscathed.There are many more features I'm not going to cover here but overall I'm happy with this. ***I would not recommend this for a beginner especially a child or teen due to its complexity and weight. This could hurt someone if it fell out the sky or if the props were driven into someone. IF your an adult you certainly could work your way through the instructions, calibrating the compass, as well as getting info from several Holystone Facebook groups. If not I highly recommend starting with a toy drone such as the Holystone HS190 with prop guards( or similar HS models) on so you can learn the basic controls of up/down, forward/backward, left/right, and the confusing for beginners, Axis left/right. It will save you from a lot of heartache.Don't expect this to perform like the thousand dollar drones out there and you will be very pleased. Its a great platform to learn from and another hit from Holystone.",,,,,556,138,https://www.amazon.com/Holy-Stone-Quadcopter-Transmission-Brushless/dp/B085HGMW9D/ref=sr_1_59_sspa?keywords=flying+ring+security+camera+drone&qid=1640229027&sr=8-59-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExNk9YUllHN0JTMFhMJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDgyNDE0M0YzM1c2UEtUQ0IxVyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDM3OTA3MUk2OERHQk9JVEFVNSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2J0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

Some are just toys for playing with indoors, but I do have another more expensive drone that is GPS enabled and that I have a lot of fun with outside. However, that drone only has a flight time of about 10 minutes, I believe due to the weight, it's very heavy for a drone. If you’re just getting into drones, I think this is a great budget beginner drone. You won’t have the range of a DJI Mini, which this drone is very similar to, but you can have the same experience up to a limited range for more than 1/3 of the price.First, when you open the package, you’ll notice a great carrying case that fits everything, including the drone, controller, two batteries, chargers and spare props. All my other drones are in the original boxes they came in or lying around loose. This case is just another great feature of this drone.The batteries on this drone last about 20 minutes each. They’re lightweight and have a much better-charging cable than previous drones. Unlike most that use the troublesome micro USB port, these use a usb cable that attaches to the battery solidly and easily. I personally hate micro USBs, as they seem to fit poorly and wear out over time. The Controller still uses the micro USB, but this isn’t charged near as often as the batteries.One thing to note on the batteries. There is a red cap that covers the battery connection on the drone. You should keep this. This piece allows you to store a battery in the drone without the electrical connection being made. Electronic equipment should never be stored with batteries connected, as it can damage both the battery and the equipment.This HS175D isn't near as heavy as my HS270. This drone is very compact and only weighs about 216 grams. I’ve also noticed this drone obtains GPS signal faster than my other drones and with 20+ minutes of flight time, I’m completely happy with that. The app that you use on the phone will walk you thru setup and preparation for flight making it quick and easy.The drone’s camera has a single axis gimble, allowing you to rotate it 90 degrees, from straight ahead to straight down. So, while you lose some ability to move in 3 directions like you would with a drone like the DJI Mini 2, you gain rigidity that protects the camera in the event of a crash. The app doesn’t have a lot of camera control for things like exposure, but it does work well for pictures and video.Other than the camera, the other difference between a high-end drone like the DJI Mini 2 is the connection between the camera and drone. Not to get too technical because both use Wi-Fi signals, but the DJI Mini 2 uses Occusync, which gives you a range of up to 11k yards (6+ miles), whereas this drone uses Wi-Fi on a 5Ghz channel, which has a longer range than say a 2.4Ghz signal, but it is limited and doesn’t like interference from solid objects. If you were operating in maximum conditions (no interference at all from other Wi-Fi signals and no physical interference, you might expect a range of about 650 yards at best. I think a more practical limit would be about 350 yards.When operating outdoors, you should keep a clear line of sight with your drone, or you may lose connection, and you won't be able to navigate with the camera. The range of the controller is better and not subject to the same limitations, so you'll still be able to control the drone, you just won't have the camera.",,,907,215,https://www.amazon.com/Holy-Stone-Drone-Camera-Adults/dp/B08VNW67MF/ref=sr_1_55_sspa?keywords=flying+ring+security+camera+drone&qid=1640229027&sr=8-55-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExNk9YUllHN0JTMFhMJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDgyNDE0M0YzM1c2UEtUQ0IxVyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDY5ODA0RVNLUDZTUkg2VzM3JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYnRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

Great drone",,"I was having a blast learning to fly this drone. It is easy to learn, control, trim, shoot video etc. Today I thought I'd take it for a short flight. Fired it up, calibrated it, checked for GPS mode and took off. Set it to climb and go forward ......beautiful. It leveled off and gave me the ""max height"" announcement. 30 seconds later I tried to turn it, tried to stop it and it just kept going straight. Eventually the wifi signal was too weak to return video but I could see the distance continuing to increase...800.....900..... I believe 1188 was the last distance reading. I thought ""not to worry, it should return home in GPS mode"" once it senses a loss of signal. Wrong. It appears to be gone. This happened about 90 minutes ago and I'm just sick as it was a gift from my wife. I'm hoping to get a replacement but am not very hopeful. Will update if seller gets back to me. 1 starUPDATE: Seller has been silent.UPDATE: Received response from ""Hellen"" the seller offering 50% refund or a replacement drone. I have requested a replacement, have added a star & will wait for it to arrive to let you know in a further update. 2 starsUPDATE: Seller has asked for a 5 star review before sending a replacement which is something I cannot do. However, I am upgrading my review to 3 stars as a token of good will and on the basis that a review of my email indicates the seller attempted to reach me a total of six times prior to my reading their offer. (Spam folder) This seems to indicate diligence on their part. At present I am optimistic and I will be sure to let you know how it goes.UPDATE: New Drone arrived about 15 minutes ago! Package looks like it has been opened previously but contents appear to be in new condition. Waiting for the batteries to charge & will update as soon as I have a couple test flights completed.

They are quick to respond on any questions I had!**HELPFUL TIPS **You want to put your DVR as close to the middle of the all the cameras as you can get it since it’s wireless the longer it is the less signal you might get (they have an extra long range antenna included if needed )Also like any night vision cameras make sure there is no light source pointing at cameras (there is image I included to show you night vision won’t work that good if there is light source pointing at it)The higher internet speed you hav the better signal you have!If this review helped you like it so others can see thanks! 😉","I've read a lot of bad reviews about this little system. Probably most of them were from folks who might not have properly set theirs up. As for me, it worked perfectly right out of the box. Nice, sharp images, both day and night. For the price of this unit, there's no complaints here. I opted for one with no HDD so I could install my own. From past experience I've learned that shipping items with a hard drive might be damaged from rough treatment along the way. I installed a 1TB SSD and it worked beautifully. Added an additional 4 cameras also. Packaging was outstanding. It was all packed as a new computer would be. Very strong and tight. I would purchase again and this seller goes high on my list.","Installation was simple. The DVR detected all cameras with no issues. The WiFi signal level wasn't all that impressive, but I did not experience any 'drop off' of cameras as seen in some other reviews. I may have to add an antenna extender to the furthest camera, but that doen't concern me that much. One feature that really stood was how easy it was to connect to a cell phone or other mobile device. Simply install the ZOSI Smart Viewer on your device, then scan the QR code on the DVR. That's it! No mucking around with port or NAT settings. No drops of ports or forwarding issues. It automatically does all of the work for you!

It is so small, you can literally put this camera anywhere and it won't be seen that easily. What i like most about this camera is it stays connected to wifi, not like some of them out there. Another good thing about this camera is when it's dark, you don't see the traditional red infrared lights in the front of the camera which even makes it more discreet. It offers micro sd card and cloud service. I use the micro sd feature and it works very well. It does run on battery for about an hour but can stay plugged in indefinitely. If you like small discreet cameras like this one all i can say is get one, you won't regret it.",,"This camera is a very tiny wifi based camera that will have a variety of use cases. I believe that it is important to know what it is and can do in order to know if it will work for you. Image quality and other basic features are fine. You can configure motion based recordings if you have storage installed as well.What this camera is not - It is not an IP cam accessible outside the app. This means that it is not possible to use it with 3rd party applications.What this camera is - It is a well designed piece of hardware that opens up some interesting use cases. For example, the mounting system is magnetic which means you can simply stick it to any surface that a magnet would normally stick to and easily retrieve it later without leaving any marks. It does come with a little self stick mount for surfaces that are not magnetic as well.Note that while the Android app functions as promised, there are a few rough edges with the current version. There are multiple ways of connecting to the camera, but the wifi method requires ignoring the onscreen instructions a little bit. The following steps are currently the correct instructions for adding via wifi:1) Reset the camera to make sure other connection types are removed by inserting a paper clip into the reset button for approximately 5 seconds. After releasing the button allow around 60 seconds for a full restart.2) In the app, select ""Add Camera"" -> WIFI Connection. Immediately select ""I heard the beep"". Note that this model (mine is the X5) does not have a speaker so there will be no beep.3) Select your 2.4Ghz wifi connection. The camera does not support 5Ghz, but your phone will see it listed.4) Point the camera at the QR code displayed on the app. While you are doing this watch the blue power light. Since there is no beep, once the blue light flashes, press Next.5) The app should confirm the connection and you should have access to your camera.",,128,78,https://www.amazon.com/Ebarsenc-Wireless-Security-Surveillance-Detection/dp/B09DGLSCMM/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hidden+outdoor+security+cameras&qid=1640230209&sr=8-1

It has been totally re-engineered. Take it from someone who owns all the different cameras Blink had to offer since day one and had to get on a waiting list to get the very first one. So, I should know what iam talking about. This new camera no longer has the push down and pull system to open the back to install batteries. It has a large screw that you simply unscrew with a included tool to open the back of the camera which is really nice. Once you open the back and install the included batteries scan the small QR code inside the camera threw the blink app it will scan to find the camera once that is done it will automatically do a firmware update. After that you are ready to install your new blink camera. Also noticed the sound is much louder and more clear then the other cameras. This is good if two people are talking in a low voice you can hear what they are saying. Has brighter clearer night vision. Nice clear voice communication with two way talk. Alot stronger wifi signal to sink module and from sink module to camera. Sharp, clear, bright, and colorful HD vision during the day. I noticed before I wrote this review that some people only gave this camera 2 or 3 stars. Like the guy who is complaining about software issues. Well if you follow the directions you would not have that problem. Let the camera finish its firmware update. Duh ! Also, if you have been a Blink customer for a while and want to add this camera to your current system. You do not have to pay for cloud storage you are grandfathered in. After you add this camera to your existing system it will actually tell you this ! The front of the camera has a all new face with a very smooth and shinny surface iam sure to help combat the weather and give it a more high tec look. Their is no longer a switch inside the camera to turn on or off the blue recording light located on the front of the camera. It's is all done threw the app which is really nice as well. They really did a good job in re-engineering this camera and listened to customer complaints about their past cameras and went threw and fixed every issue. I would definitely buy this camera again ! UPDATE : 09-25-20 After using this camera for a couple of days. And as other reviewers have noted that this camera only has a 25 foot motion trigger ! Anything further than 25 feet it will NOT record when motion is present. So if you need a camera get the Blink XT2 for the further range. This camera will only be good for specific areas like door or window that are within the 20 to 25 foot range from the camera.","It's super easy. Works great. Setup was simple. It works exactly as advertised. What I didn't know for sure is that the batteries are just high quality AA batteries. So when they die, you can get some rechargeable ones and just rotate them through the thing. I'm going to order a couple more. They are pretty great. *Edit-A nice person took the time to let me know it's best not to replace w/ traditional AA batteries.","So far everything is as advertised. Setup was a breeze and the image quality is great - especially when set to “best.” I really appreciate the custom activity zones that you can set, as well as the ability the turn off the led light.In terms of improvement, the included mount is pretty basic. For better or worse the mount snaps into the back of the camera module. This makes installing it relatively easy, but also means anyone could detach it with a firm pull. I’ve noticed that there are upgraded mounts that you buy, but haven’t had a chance to fully check those out yet.Lastly, I noticed another reviewer mentioned subscription pricing, but it’s a bit misleading. Yes, there is cloud storage that you can pay for, but there are multiple levels, including a free plan, as well as a basic plan for $3/month. Also, the paid plans don’t start until 2021. More importantly, What this camera has, that the XT2 doesn’t, is local storage. If you’re big on privacy, and don't want to store videos on the cloud, you can attach a USB drive to the blink module and save your videos there (see photo which shows the usb drive). There’s no fee for saving your videos locally - you can still get alerts and watch your video feed live for free.",What an awesome product...total install took 25 minutes. I put 3 camera’s up outside to monitor my summer home. One of the camera’s I places on a pole in the yard pointing at the roof so I can monitor snow fall and snow melt roof system. The app was friendly. I shared the app with my wife and she was up and running in 2 minutes with minimal effort.

Initializing the cameras was fairly easy, although one wouldn't detect the QR code right away, but was fine after a factory reset.Additionally, consider buying directly from the Arlo website. I didn't realize until after I bought them that Arlo offers 1 year of protection against the theft of your cameras if you don't purchase them through a third party like Amazon. That piece of mind would have been worth it to me.I was surprised by the included mounting hardware. I expected to find 3 of the small magnetic mounts, which are attached to the wall with just one screw and to the camera with a magnet. I didn't think that sounded very secure, so I ordered 3 of Arlo's pivoting screw mounts. It turned out that the box of cameras contained 1 smaller pivoting screw mount already, though, so I am returning one of the ones I bought.",I have purchased three Arlo Pro 4 cameras. They connected to my WiFi network with ease. They promptly notify me when motion is detected. I've been extremely pleased with my purchases & will likely purchase another one.,"There was a robbery at gunpoint in the middle of the day on our street. The neighbors camera caught a lot of video that the police officers could use to catch and prosecute the guy. This is my first outside security camera I have ever had and I absolutely love it! I like that you can pause the notifications it send you for different periods of time. I also like that you can look at your videos and use a filter for it to only show you videos (in your history) of animals. In the app, you can also pause videos (or not) and zoom in while reviewing videos. I made a suggestion to the technology support that it would be nice to have the ability to select which zones (that you have set up) will trigger the camera. I asked him, “What’s the sense in setting up zones if you can’t pick and choose which zone(s) you want to monitor for a certain period of time?” (like, monitoring/triggering only zone 1 at night and monitoring all zones during the day) I had to set up my zones so that the tree branches would not trigger the camera when they blew in the wind. The only problem now is that the shadows of the tree branches on my driveway often trigger the camera. Overall, this is a great camera for the price and if I were to buy another one, it would be an Arlo.","The camera comes securely packaged and ready to operate after a quick battery charge. I did have a bit of trouble getting the owner's manual to download. It went fine on my iPad, but when I tried to get a backup copy to my laptop, I received an error number that then took me to a 'tech chat' option. Sadly, that was a connection to some scammers (in my opinion) who tried to sell me some very expensive and unnecessary security. They told untruths and pressured me a lot. Arlo needs to know this and the bad impression of the Arlo company they conveyed. The camera itself, though is fine and gives clear images. Just a warning here for folks who might run into the same situation.",,1383,359,https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Pro-Spotlight-Camera-Wire-Free/dp/B092RSNGTY/ref=sr_1_12?keywords=hidden+outdoor+security+cameras&qid=1640230209&sr=8-12

First off, the camera itself feels nicely made and doesn't feel cheap. It includes everything you need in the box, microSD card included. It is very easy to setup and start using. You must charge the battery manually before first use. This took quite a few hours, but it's to be expected. Make sure you charge the battery externally from the camera. This pack includes their security lock box and cable. These are very well made and make tampering with the device a lot more difficult. If someone really wanted it, they would need some special tools to get to it.Once the battery is charged, you're good to complete the setup. The app walks you through everything and the app itself is very user friendly. Because this camera works over LTE networks, there is a subscription plan you must have to use it, There is a 7 day Elite package trial which includes unlimited photos and up to 40 HD photos. When motion is detected the camera sends a low quality image to your phone - typically takes about 4 to 5 seconds to receive it. The quality of this image is low for most standards, but you can still make out what is going on. I have attached some samples of the lower quality images to this review. If you wish to see the image in high resolution, you have to request it. It will send the HD photo when the next communication is with the camera (so you won't get the HD photo right away). I have also attached a few samples of the HD photos, as well.The camera lens itself on this camera is not bad for what it is. It's not a very wide angle lens, so be aware. The camera quality on the HD photos is pretty good and the night vision works just fine.My camera has been mounted for about a week from the writing of this review and it has been at 100% battery ever since. The solar panel does a great job keeping the camera charged and active. It has been through rain, snow, frost, and even some warmer temperatures as well and had no issues operating in those conditions.All things considered, a camera like this is not for everyone. It is great if you own property and can't get a Wi-Fi signal there with other cameras. It is a little expensive if you ask me and then you do have to buy a monthly subscription to keep it active. You of course can retrieve all HD photos from the SD card if you choose, but that would require you to go to the camera's location to get them - defeating the purpose of having a setup like this. Keep in mind this camera does photos only - no videos. Even though I think it's a little expensive, I gave it 5 stars because it does work as described and it does do the job well. It all depends on the user and the user's needs. If you need something that you can just set and forget about, this is it!","I have a cabin up in the mountains where I don’t get Wi-Fi (a true retreat from the world!). Then again, I’m not always up there, so having this security camera set up offers some peace of mind. It is a solidly constructed piece of tech, to be sure. It also has a decent, hefty weight to it, so I don’t feel as though it’ll get damaged easily out in the middle of nowhere.The pictures come across crisp and clean. The solar battery has held up so far, and keeps it charged without anything extra to date. I did have to give it the initial charge to get it going, but haven’t had any issues since. I do wish I could check in on demand, but then again, I would probably be checking it out far too often for no reason! The pictures are sent to me when motion detection occurs, and that’s what is really needed. I like that it has cheap plans for the LTE provision. Even the night vision is not bad!","I picked this up for a house we had put an offer on. The house was multiple acres and I wanted to put it out near the front of the property where there was no power. Unfortunately the deal on the house fell through but the camera is still great.Despite not having an actual use for it at my current house I did test it out. The camera is basically a ""set and forget"" device as it seems to keep itself charged in the daytimes and last through the nights even on nights with lots of rain. IT hasn't died yet even with some overcast days so it must not use that much power compared to what its little solar panel makes.The LTE plans from the company are a bit steep but supposedly I can use another Sim card depending on the carrier. One day I may find this out if I do actually find another house like the one I originally picked this for.",,,23,3,https://www.amazon.com/Cellular-Security-Solar-Powered-Surveillance-Virtually/dp/B08WCFQJV9/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=hidden+outdoor+security+cameras&qid=1640230209&sr=8-13

So far I’m quite impressed. But I’ll update this review later on.,Great customer service!,Superb Wireless Cameras,"These cameras already caught someone trying to come onto my property, and the alarm scared them away! Funny thing is, I didn’t even know they had an alarm!!You can set the security feature to home or away, the former will not sound an alarm if you walk in front of the camera and set off the motion detection, whereas the latter will sound a high-pitched alarm to ward off anyone encroaching on your property that shouldn’t be.Excellent camera clarity for this price point. The battery life is phenomenal. I don’t think they will really last the full 365 days, but it’ll be at least 6-8 months, which is better than my 2-3 weeks that the Arlo cameras would typically last.Get these, you won’t regret it!","First, I have been a customer of Eufy for a few years now. Started with their robo-vac and have several other items from them. My personal experience, they have had GREAT customer service through the years! So when we recently had an issue at our house and started my security camera research journey, Eufy was of course on my list.After about 2 weeks worth of research and weighing the pros/cons of wired vs wireless, it came down to the EufyCam 2 and Arlo Pro. After reading several reviews and watching Youtube, I decided on EufyCam 2. I'll start with my only complaint: there should be a charging cable for EACH camera. It doesn't cost much to produce those small charging cables, especially when your parent company is Anker. I had to dig through and find cables about the house to charge all the cameras at the same time. Other than that...I love these cameras!The setup was VERY easy. It took all of 10 minutes, maybe, to do 5 total cameras (I bought an additional one along with this 4-pack). The only issue I had and haven't really messed with yet to fix was adding the cameras to HomeKit. I tried a few times and it would not connect. Not a big deal since I'm not fully integrated into the HomeKit ecosystem so no knock on that.Each camera came with it's own hardware and 2 different mounting options. I went with the screw in option since it would take some time for someone to steal it. Though, I did set the anti-theft option on which emits a siren when unscrewed. I really loved that they included 2 mounting stickers also to help you with drilling placement. This was nice since I was able to just stick it where I wanted to drill and it hides behind the mounting system. So no need to mark with a pencil etc.Once installed and have been using them for 2 weeks, I can say that I am really happy that I went with Eufy. The picture quality is great, day or night. In the app, I would start with the highest sensitivity and work your way down to your liking. The app works flawlessly for me so far. I get quick notifications, the play back is pretty instant and I have not had any issues with the cameras connecting, yet. It does run off of wifi so you can't expect this, or any wireless camera, to be perfect. I will add a wifi-6 mesh system in the next few months to help but again, it's wireless cameras so don't set high standards.In conclusion, if you're looking for great, 1080p recording, FREE self monitoring, wireless system that you can move wherever you want, I would look no further. Based on years of experience, Eufy has phenomenal customer service so rest assured that if you have an issue, it will be resolved. Not to forget, these little cameras look great around your house too. Hope this helps someone out there :)*I'll update this review as the time passes and any good/bad issues or thoughts come up*Pros:WirelessEasy installHomekit integrationUser Friendly AppCustomer ServiceBuild qualityPicture qualityResponsive appPrice (just my opinion)Cons:Would prefer a charging cable per camera","So far I am pretty impressed with these cameras. I purchased this kit as well as 2 additional add on cameras. I upgraded from an Arlo 5 camera system. I’m definitely not comparing these two systems because my arlos were the first generation cameras.But these Eufy cameras are working out well for me. I like the design of the camera, makes them a little more conspicuous. I had a little connectivity problem with one camera but I just repositioned it; my router and base station is on the complete opposite side of the house, so to be expected. All the other camera had zero connectivity issues. The notification delay is only a couple seconds. My arlos were at least 5-7 seconds.The time it takes for the camera to livestream on my phone is only about 3-5 seconds. Which is way faster than any Arlo system.Most importantly is that there aren't storage/ subscription fees, which is exactly why I’ll be ditching my RING doorbell real soon. Arlo allows you to have 5 cams max before there’s a fee. Not with Eufy.","EDIT: Customer service reached out to me and resolved the issue by kindly making up the price difference as a refund. I'm changing my review to five stars because the Eufy customer service is excellent and the cameras are quite good. I found the setup to be quite easy.OLD:Deal of the day went on sale right after purchasing, eufy customer service refused to price match and indicated I should instead take all the cameras down and return them then rebuy at the cheaper price. Ecological waste and a pain in the butt to the customer but the product works so there's that....","I used to have a wired security camera system and after 7 years it stopped working on me. I gave these cameras a try because 1) This is the same company that made Anker products and 2)I saw plenty of good reviews on Youtube. After one week of usage, I am very pleased with these cameras! There are plenty of ways to adjust the settings such as motion detection, battery/power management, linking it to it other cameras... The ample of settings features is a big plus. The Eufy app has plenty of features, yet it is seamless and easy to use. The only thing is that I wish the battery would last longer. I've had it for 1 week now and a camera is already at 92%. Granted, I used and tested that camera frequently and rigorously. Also, the mount that it comes with is not the greatest. I weren't able to tilt and turn the camera the way I wanted to.Pros:1) Great to use app2) Plenty of settings to please users3) Sleek and stylish4) Completely Wireless5) Good motion detection (if camera is between 7-10 ft high)6) Good night visionCons:1) Mount can be improved (more angles and tilting)2) Better screws/anchors? Especially for drilling into cement/bricks?3) ExpensiveOverall very good product.

It is easy to set up and use. The picture quality is good (HD quality or a little better). Support by email is good. However, upon ""motion detection"" the receipt of the notification email with pictures posted to my Vosker account may arrive within 30 seconds or several hours. I find this troubling considering this is a LTE (AT&T, Verizon) based security camera. I have 5x5 signal reception (strongest). This issue may be a problem with the volume of cellular traffic between the Vosker servers and my email account. I would expect Vosker to monitor the traffic and adjust the network and routing. Vosker management is free to respond to my comment. For a top quality security camera like the V200 this should not happen.","We are building a house out in the country that is over an hour drive one way from our house. We wanted to be able to keep an eye on the construction process to know when it would be worth our time to drive up to the site and back. From my research, I determined the best type of camera was one that had solar charging capabilities and also cellular built-in in order to send me photos when there was activity. So I bought this camera. I played around with it for over a month at my home in order to get a sense of how the camera worked and which settings were the best for me. The camera is super easy to activate and you get one month free of the elite plan, which is unlimited photos. I ended up opting to continue this plan after the one month free trial period. For $20 a month I can get as many photos as I want sent to me and 40 photos upgraded to high DEF if requested. Once I had a good feel of how the camera and the associated app worked, we drove up to the construction site and found a tree that pointed toward the site that we felt had a good point of view. I’m glad I played around with this at home first so I didn’t have to fool around with it when we were setting it up. I love the VOSKER app and set the camera to send me photos every two hours. This camera is working wonderfully and since it’s been installed it has maintain 100% battery power through the solar panel. It helps that we have a cell tower on a mountain above our build side which gives a 5 x 5 signal. The night vision took a photo of a couple deer walking around the construction site at 1 AM from 50 feet away in complete darkness. We had a person who came to the site and I thought that he worked for our builder but wasn’t sure from the standard definition photos sent so I requested a high def photo and determined that this was the guy I thought it was. The camera is doing everything we hoped it would and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I am thinking that maybe some of the one star reviews came at a time when VOSKER was doing a software upgrade that caused people issues. That is partly the reason why I wanted to do a review. I couldn’t be more thrilled with my purchase.",I love this camera and phone app!! I use it as my primary driveway camera system. It never fails to alert me of visitors when I am at home or away. I will be buying another one for my other home.,I use the camera to see who comes and goes on my drive way.the reaction time is a little slow on the v 200.if the vehicle is driving a little too fast you miss the plate#.The other issue is the GPS location feature should only be accessed from the phone app.Alot of people use game cameras and if their robbed they take the camera to.So far I'm very happy with the results,"I own a number of these and they are really decent outdoor cameras.

PLEASE READ,Better Than Average For Its Size,,,,"This is a tiny and affordable little camera, and I have to say it takes pretty impressive video! I learned a lot of helpful info just by reading other people's reviews so I wanted to be sure to leave my own review. It does take sound and video, it is pretty easy to use if you have real instructions, and it is easy to view your photos and video by plugging right into your laptop etc or pulling memory card to put into card reader.1) You need your own memory card. (This is probably obvious if you buy cameras much but I didn't realize and had to wait for my additional memory card order. I bought a 32 GB TF memory card as another review recommended TF card and I wasn't sure what to get. Works perfectly!) It doesn't work without it.2) Search ""SQ11 Mini Camera"" on YouTube and skip reading the included directions. They're extremely confusing and seem more targeted for trouble shooting if you already know how to use the camera. The gist of it is - turn on with power button, click mode button, and then power button to begin recording video. There are two video resolution settings and also a photo mode, as well as night vision. It's much simpler just to watch a YouTube video to sort how to change each of these settings etc than trying to explain it in writing.Sidenote:I have yet to figure out how to use while charging, it seems to only allow me to shoot while it is unplugged. I have seen some other reviews mention it's possible so I'm probably missing it, considering it hadn't occurred to me to buy a separate memory card it's very possible.I haven't had anything interesting to video so I'll have to hold a video review for when I do!","Let me start off by saying I'm not tech savy.It's small, making it discrete. It's lightweight, but didn't break when I dropped it. Not fragile. There's an odd rainbow sticker on it. If you're trying to hide it, then why would you have a bright sticker on it? I don't want attention drawn to the device. I removed it. It was very easy to do & didn't damage the camera.The instructions are a bit wordy & confusing. You definitely won't be able to memorize the instructions, but that's okay because I want to ""set it & forget it"" for 100 minutes (that's the run time on the camera at full charge). It was difficult to figure out so keep the instructions in a safe place or better yet...take a picture of the instructions & keep it on your phone.It comes with a TF card (micro SD). I found it easier to read it from my computer with a micro SD reader rather than using the cord & camera that is included.Overall, I like this camera. The motion detection & low light worked most of the time, & the quality is better than average. I really like the wide angle lense option.The image & stabilization were great. The camera held on the clip well. When I went to pinch the clip...the camera went flying and landed on my wood floors.

Open your box and check contents2. Set aside your instruction book for reference later3. Plug in your new cam to charge itNext1. Using a laptop or cell phone, open your wireless network lista. With a laptop or tablet, open your control panel and go to Network settingsb. Click on “list available networks” and look for the wireless device as listed in your webcam instructions2. Log on to your new webcam3. Download the viewing app listed in the instruction book4. Start the app.5. Click on “add a webcam” and add the name and address found on your webcam6. Once your webcam is found, change the network from the factory setting to the network being used where the camera will be located.7. Once located and shown in the app, you can then change the name of the cam and password.8. Enjoy your new webcam!","I was skeptical given some of the other review. Maybe those were for earlier versions. The instructions are as complete as the product's functionality. I found them quite clear in plain English. Maybe a little Chinenglish, but they must have had someone go over it and render the instructions pretty clear. The flow of the instructions are actually well laid out. As other reviewers have noted, do be so overly zealous to put this through its paces without reading the instructions. While the camera seems intuitive, there is a lot of good direction in the instructions - - use them!The images is very clear and I recommend using the 1080 resolution. Shutter speed is fixed at 30fps. Even at night, the camera produces pretty clear images in very low light (and that's without the night vision on). The IR lights are truly invisible to the human eye and are quite decent. They enable the camera to see clearly about 10 feet. If you get this, plan to keep it plugged into a wall charger all the time, or if you want it as a body cam, then plug it into a rechargeable power bank. In cold weather, using this as a body cam gave me about 15 minutes of battery life. Like ALL other IR cameras, you cannot use the IR lights to see through windows at night. It's like standing in front of your bathroom mirror with the door closed and lights off at night and then shinning a super bright flashlight into the mirror and then trying to see your reflection - -this will never work. For that to work, you'd need IR lights outside the window.I plan to attach this to a helmet and record skiing videos, but the limited shutter speed will likely produce ho-hum videos compared to the high-speed of an iPhone or GoPro. If I fall and trash this, well I'm only out $50 - - a lot better than being out $400. Oh, and this is way lighter than a GoPro. We'll see. The magnetic holder is nice and there are multiple options. The camera has a magnet behind the back plate. If you want to mount the camera to the ceiling or drywall, they include a small metal (iron) disk that you velcro or glue to a non-metalic surface. then the camera can be placed and easily removed from the disk. But, battery life is about 60-90 minutes, you still need near-by power.There are two WiFi modes 1.) WiFi directly to your phone which is the mode you have when you receive it or after you press the reset. This is great for using the device as a dash cam in a car, in a hotel, or out in field away from routers. You use this mode to connect your phone directly to the camera when you are within range. When connected directly to camera with phone, you can switch the camera to WiFi mode 2.) which means you log the camera into a local WiFi network. This allows you to see and control the camera from anywhere in the world with a cell phone (no laptop software to access it). In either mode, the camera is burning electricity to run a WiFi network meaning that the battery can only hold out for about 90 minutes max.You have basically two ways to capture and store video 1.) Directly to a phone's memory BUT the phone has to be actively watching (or connected via WiFI mode 1 or 2) to the camera. 2.) Directly to a microSD card. If you plan to use this as a security camera, it could alert you to motion of an intruder, but if they spot the camera, all they need to do is take it and you will not have any video (e.g. no cloud storage option). Now, if you happen to log into the camera because you got an alert on your phone, you can begin recording video to your phone. In that case, having the camera taken still leaves you with those security images on your phone. I must say, the motion detection on this is awesome - - way better than my Arlo camera's. It does not use passive IR, it detects changes in the background. On the highest sensitivity, it goes off when my neighbors dog comes into view about 75-100 meters away. It picks up an individual walking on the sidewalk about 100 meters away and cars going down the street about 150 meters away. It has 7 levels of sensitivity setting and can also be disabled. You can also schedule when you want it to be motion sensitive. Lots of options for security including the alert interval and recording duration.I'm impressed enough with this camera that I plan to buy one for my son's dorm room as they've had a rash of thefts in the school. The frontal area of the camera is about that of a silver dollar (US). It might be pretty easy to disguise/hide. I plan to buy 1 or two more, since they are affordable, to monitor the back room behind a complex aquarium system. I want to monitor liquid levels in several containers as well as some instruments when I'm away from the system on long trips.","Very nice mini camera that provides various ways to use. I downloaded the free app that has simple setup instructions for connecting the mini camera to your WI-fi and store videos on your phone or tablet. Videos can also be stored on the micro SD card (that you supply). You can monitor multiple cameras on the phone app. The mode button allows you to toggle between continuous videos and motion detected.The camera is powered by a rechargeable battery or by directly connecting to an outlet via the USB connector that is provided.The back of the camera is magnetic and can be placed on most metal objects or you can use the magnetic pedestal. The other end of the pedestal has an adhesive backing. Also, provided is a short (5 inch) flexible USB connector that can be used along with a USB adapter. There is, also, an iron disk with an adhesive backing for another alternative for camera placement.For WiFi setup, download the P2PLiveCam app to your phone or tablet. The back of the camera has a QR Code for easy setup.The camera is 1080p with a wide angle lens, with motion detection and night vision.This is a great mini camera for the price. I highly recommend it.","So, this is a personal hideable discreet camera. It comes with 2 usb cables (one short and one longer) to attach to your pc as well as plug into your phone charger to power up the camera battery. It comes with a magnetic disk and an adjustable stand. One side of the disk has an adhesive so you can either stick it to the charger or stick it to the base. I wasn't clear exactly where I was supposed to place it. They also provided a washer that can be placed between the stand and the camera, but, I didn't quite understand why. The instructions were very easy to follow and very on point. If you mess something up, go back and read through the instructions and start over. They have it pretty well written to make it easy for us to understand. It can be set to connect with your WiFi so you can watch live video or record from anywhere using the app on your phone. I wish there was a way to adjust the tone/hue on the video as mine was showing a bit pinkish. There are several tools to use with the video which makes it nice. It can be set to M(Motion) or L(Loop recording) so it can be constantly recording if you choose to do so. It doesn't come with an SD card, though. I wish they had included a packing list so that you know what all you have received and what to do with each piece. Otherwise, great camera!","I bought the camera for security for my car and it worked so well that a couple of days later bought a second one. Lots of good features handy magnetic mount and good pictures. Heavy rain negatively effected the resolution to the point the pictures were useless but just plane dark was no problem, the night pictures were good. I don't believe any camera would have worked in the heavy rain that we got. Although it is not an outdoor camera I made a little shelter out of a black plastic cup and could still use the magnetic mount, powered from the car battery through the USB plug. The onboard battery probably doesn't have a lot of capacity, I didn't test the endurance but I suspect a couple of hours anyway.The support from the manufacturer was great, stellar in fact. Very helpful and very prompt to reply.There are three recording modes always on, record as movement is sensed, or record on a schedule. The control of the camera is through my Android phone, it can be controlled directly as long as you are within range, then the camera is set up and left to work on it's own, or if a WiFi connection is available to the camera you can view the image being recorded and control the camera from anywhere you have cell service and internet available. Later I will use them to monitor the house when we're out. I'm pleased with the camera's and will move them to a house security roll later. They are easy to hide and notify you if movement is sensed if you want (in addition to recording the event).And I would like to mention again that the technical support was great! I highly recommend the camera.",4803,406,https://www.amazon.com/AREBI-Camcorder-Activated-A10-Plus/dp/B07GB2T125/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=hidden+outdoor+security+cameras&qid=1640230209&sr=8-2

This product is IP66 rated, which means that it is protected against multi-directional high-pressure water jets. The camera has 130 degree wide angle FOV and a night vision range of 33’.Integration. The camera was easily integrated into my current Dzees app and took only a couple minutes to configure and setup.Installation. The installation was also easy. I am personally not a fan of the pedestal mount. Previous Dzees cameras provided two mounting options. A pedestal mount and a magnetic mount. They appear to have moved away from the magnetic mounts which I really enjoyed for easy of setup and take down for charging.Quality. The resolution and quality of the video and photos are excellent and something I have come to expect from this manufacturer. You can live stream up to 1080P and get crisp images and video.Night Vision. The camera offers dual sourced white light color night vision. Which honestly, in my opinion, is not night vision if a light has to come on to provide a color video. But the standard IR night vision is sharp and has good quality definition. While it can max out the range at 33’. I found that you still get good quality up to about 28’.Rechargeable. This product comes equipped with an internal Lithium-Ion battery that can power the camera from 2-4 months depending on the features active.Features. This camera offers a lot of features.2-Way AudioSpotlightAlarmNight VisionReal-Time StreamingWirelessThe app offers flexibility and is highly configurable. From triggers to recording time settings to frequency and resolution settings. This camera and app package offers solid features that I have come to depend on as a deterrent and for security.Extra (Paid) Features. The app also offers some additional features that you have to buy a subscription for.AI AnalysisActivity ZoneThe subscriptions range from $3 - 32 dollars depending on the plan.One of the nice features about the AI Analysis is that it will analysis when what it is detecting is Person, Pet, Package or Vehicle and alert you appropriately.But the Activity Zone is the real piece that I wish was part of the app without having to pay for it. It allows you to mark specific areas to notify you. I fine this extremely handy. For example, I have a camera overlooking my driveway and I have a flag out almost all the time. The flag triggers the movement alerts all the time. So I have to turn off motion detection and notifications or it will drain the battery much faster. With Activity Zones I can set it up so that the flag is not in my detection area. That way it does not trigger any motion and thus I can keep motion detection on and still have the security I want from this camera to detect anything moving that is not in the area of my flag moving.You also get cloud storage with the paid subscription. But I much prefer the SD Cards for a couple reasons. I control my own recordings and I still have the ability to record if the power is tampered with or goes out as it is not dependent on the internet to store data somewhere else. Just something to keep in mind.As mentioned, the manufacturer used to offer a magnetic mount which I am a huge fan of. That is unfortunate for me but it is still an excellent camera system.The manufacturer offers a 3-Year Warranty on this product IF you register it online.I appreciate you taking the time to read this. I received this product in exchange for an honest review. All in all, this is another quality camera from a manufacturer I have come to trust for my security. This camera offers flexibility and security with multiple features from notifications to spotlighting to an audio alarm and more. This camera is an excellent addition to my security that I use daily and trust with my family’s safety. Hope this information was helpful. [5 Stars]This product is made in China.","A very good security camera. Easy to follow instructions. Excellent camera clarity and field of vision. I like that I can add my own sd card so I can store notifications/recordings without having to pay extra for cloud storage. I also like that I can share the camera with members of my family so they can receive notifications as well. I am using this camera in tandem with a doorbell camera from another company. I am actually disappointed in my doorbell camera because it does a very poor job of providing clear pictures at nighttime. Nighttime viewing on the Dzees security camera puts the well known brand name doorbell camera to shame.You can add a package that includes cloud recording storage with intelligent notification and activity zone for as little as $3 per month. If you are using a sd card to store recordings then I personally don’t see the value in adding the cloud recording. The value comes from the intelligent notification which allows the camera to distinguish between a person, animal or vehicle. And Activity Zone allows you to set a particular area in the cameras view to send you notifications.","I purchased a camera previously from this company and have been looking to add more to my house. When I found out that they had a new camera coming out I couldn't wait to get it. Ordered it on Sunday and on Monday it arrived! Got it set up easily with the app that we already had installed for the other camera we own. Synced up quickly with no issues.For fun we placed it under our Christmas Tree with low light and could see very clearly as our pets moved about the living room.Because this camera is outdoor it mounts with a main screw into the back, previous models they have have a magnetic ball mount option that is not available with this camera. The mount comes with everything you need and securely stays when installed properly. The mounting package also comes with drywall anchors if you decide to mount it inside like we will be doing.Important thing to note is that you need an SD card in order for it to record when motion is detected. This is nothing new for cameras like this. Unless you plan on going with a subscription based security system you will always need a SD card nowadays. That is one reason I love doing security my way, getting a 64gb SD card is really cheap and goes a long way. I'm always able to access the camera and the past history if needed.Overall we are once again really happy with our purchase. Dzees is on our list of products to watch for whenever they come out with new cameras. They are never the most expensive but also are never the cheapest. They do well outside in conditions, especially where I am in NY, it gets 90+ in the summer and below zero in the winter. So if it can withstand the wide range of weather I have I'm sure it candle just about anywhere.","This is my third Dzees outdoor camera. My first 2 are older model with magnetic mount. I bought this new model because of satisfaction with my previous purchases and great Dzees customer service.The screw mounting of new model needs more time to take down to charge battery, but it does provide more flexible monitor angle.I just stayed with VicoHome app which has no problem to handle both old and new model. The DzeesHome app has almost identical UI and features comparing to VicoHome, however VicoHome has battery percentage in main setting but DzeesHome app needs to go one step deeper to see battery %. The app has scheduled sleep function for older model, but not for this newer model. This is not critical but definitely nice to have feature, hope the newer model will bring back this feature with future firmware/app upgrade.Picture quality is good, both cloud and SD card footages are clear and easy to review. The viewing angle is about the same, and the newer model seems having better colored image/video.Battery life seems a little bit better than older model, it’s still over 90% after one week, but that could be different amount of motion detected.Overall, it’s a nice wire-free indoor/outdoor camera.",,95,81,https://www.amazon.com/Dzees-Wireless-Spotlight-Rechargeable-Detection/dp/B09GJN2KCY/ref=sr_1_11?keywords=home+security+cameras&qid=1640228950&sr=8-11

I installed these on a rental house where Im having tenant issues. For that purpose they work. They are inexpensive and I had access to my own hard disks.The Good:Camera quality is surprisingly good in both resolution and physical durability. They do not feel cheap and light. Hopefully time will tell how waterproof they are. The seller seems to have good reviews on backing up the warranty though so again we'll see how it all turns out. Its also nice the system can go up to 8 channels, so there is room to add more. The resolution is very good as well and it gives the choice of standard or high res when viewing the app depending on how fast you want the buffer to run depending on your connection. High res is extremely nice.The Bad:Software just sucks. Its a PITA to get working. Ive hooked up numerous systems, even my own SWANN system (which is very nice when you get it up and running) but this one just does NOT want to cooperate. First it makes you create a random account for password retrieval, which is odd because there is no reason to ever retrieve a password since logging on the system requires the ""LOCAL"" account password. For that you can simply reset the system. Being that this is a VERY foreign (Chinese) system, it sort of makes you wonder. Secondly getting the system just to start working with the app was insanely difficult and the instructions are HORRIBLE. I will explain below in my tips for setting up.Also the android app (which I use) is pretty bad. It works on my phone (pixel 2), its works on my tenants phone (samsung) but is not compatible with my pixel C? Also it does require some odd permissions. Go in and turn off all the access in android that the app doesnt need like phone, microphone and any others. Im going to try one by one turning them all off until it just doesnt work. I dont like it wants local storage access (which might be for playback), location or camera either.I would like to install this on my pixel c tablet but it is not compatible. Also On the samsung phone you can get a 4 window view but for some reason on my pixel 2 Im only able to view one camera at a time. Have NOT figured this out.Now for some tips on setting up which I plan on possibly making a video for so others dont get frustrated:No matter HOW MANY times I tried to set this up using the ip/domain settings it would not take. I personally prefer that method for trouble shooting and control. No matter what ports I forwarded in the router and brain unit it just WOULD NOT work. I decided to try the QR scan method. That got me no where for 2 different days at about an hour each. I FINALLY figured out when scanning the QR the app was placing about 20 random invisible digits after the QR serial. Once I noticed that I removed those and entered the LOCAL password and it finally connected. Again you set up a random account when you install the app but thats all its for, its very suspicious honestly.Once the app was setup and connected though I got nothing but black screens on everything, all four cameras black. I then realized in the back I had connected the 4 cameras to slot 5-8 and not 1-4. Why this mattered to the unit is beyond me. Why the app just blacked out 5-8 even though it showed connected is strange. I placed the cameras on 1-4 and all of a sudden the app worked. On the actual unit all the cameras were viewing fine but the app is just really picky.Tech support is ONLY in China apparently but when emailing through amazon I did get some form of support back from someone who emailed back some image requests. Be SURE to blot out any personal IP info if you do send this tech support images.I next have to figure out how to utilize the record and playback plus setup an email account for image forwarding.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so the tips are !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!use LOCAL pass to login, NOT account pass!!!Make SURE cameras are in the port in order or it will NOT work!!!be SURE the app is not putting empty spaces after the QR serial when scanning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Fix the app and you have a VERY solid affordable camera systemUpdate - 5/31/19I had to get a replacement system as the one I had continuously locked up and rebooted. It would also not keep the correct time, and this was an issue since installation but I figured it was a glitch and just memorized the difference. Also on every lock up it would reset the time if I changed it.Anyway getting a replacement was easy but upon install I was again having trouble. I just couldnt get the thing to work with the app. Apparently theres a new app called ZosiSmart in the android store and though its the same DVR (I think anyway), I need to use the new app because the serials have changed. It gave me a little trouble and took a couple DVR reboots but it finally caught the signal and connected. Seems to work fine, thought the new app appears to catch and run a bit slower than the old. Either way, I have my camera system back up and running on my units and let me tell you, thank god I did this as it got me out of a couple jams in just the one year it was up. Im able to position the systems cameras to see all 3 houses and their parking, plus watch the street (which I already told the police in the area I have the system in case they ever need footage. I work very well with the department in my area and its very well reciprocated. If you own any rentals or a business its a really good idea to build a working relationship with whatever law enforcement covers your neighborhoods.I want to especially thank Emma from ZOSI, who helped me through the process via email.","This zosi security system is awesome! At 79.99 it gives great picture quality during the day and at night. Setup was simple by just running the wires and finding where your cameras will go. It didn't come w a hard drive but I had one laying around and used that. I just opened the box and plugged it into the provided SATA cables. I did run in to a few problems during setup but they were solved with a little thought. 1. The DVR system comes press to a lower resolution for a HDMI cable, so if u have a 1080 p or better tv, then you better find a 720 p tv to plug the HDMI cable into so you can see the screen to change the resolution.2. The cameras come w 2 adjustments. The first is obvious for up and down or side to side but the second is the nearest screw to the camera itself. Unscrew this almost all the way out to rotate the camera in any direction then screw it back in to use as a set screw.","Will update if there are any changes; however, it was easy to set up and good picture quality for 720p. Wish I got a 180 deg. cameras but they work for the purpose I purchased it for. Night vision is good (don't really have much to compare it to). The android and PC apps work but can be a little glitchy from time to time (ch. 2 sometimes does not load but comes up eventually). DVR function works well.I have included pictures of both the android app and PC app (picture quality is much better directly from DVR and on playback)","Bought this wired system for my free standing garage, because we don't have dedicated wifi. Did a temporary test setup in my home since I was skeptical of the quality at such a low price. Didn't want to put in the effort to do the final install to find out it was a bust. Installed the $35 500 GB Western Digital hard drive that I purchased separately, hooked the DVR up to an old lcd tv via vga, hooked up cameras, powered it up, followed instructions to format the hard drive, set it to record and watched it work. Took 30 minutes and it has been running for a couple of days with no issues. I've been able to easily review the recorded content. Camera Day/night feature works great and transitions smoothly as light levels change. I'm now satisfied it really is a great deal and will do final install in the garage next week. Several friends have indicated an interest in purchasing a system for their homes.","Are you serious ? for this price point. I bought one of these to install at my mother in laws house. She does not want anything fancy, so i saw this and thought i was check out the quality.3 years back i installed a QSEE system, 4 camera's, DVR with 500GB HD. That was $400, and honestly i see very little difference between the quality of the 2 systems, in actual fact, i think this one is giving better daytime quality than the QSEE.Nighttime quality seems good, i would say facial recognition at 25 feet.Put 7200RPM HD i had laying around (one of many) in, formatted it, recording in seconds.As a bonus, when it put it all back in the box, it all fit perfect !! i mean, who does that ?",3343,488,https://www.amazon.com/ZOSI-8-Channel-Security-Weatherproof-Surveillance/dp/B00VUVIH9Y/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=home+security+cameras&qid=1640228950&sr=8-15

Especially if you're a single woman. The camera is affordable and the video is clear also easy to use.

It has 2 different models, Day and Night. It will change automatically.

I can track what my dogs are doing in other rooms at night, and I can see what my dogs are doing at any time. I like it very much, as of now I highly recommend it. I am very satisfied with this purchase on Amazon.","I'm always looking for a remote camera to look at my home when I'm working in the office. This camera satisfies all my requirements such as playback, night vision, and audio talking with my two kittens. It's glad to see them stay safe and play around even I can't stay with them. What I like most is its price! It includes two cameras at a cheap price, with which I can only buy one from other sellers.

GOOD SYSTEM,Excellent System,Opinion from a network data technician,"I absolutely love this system. I purchased it through Amazon for my home, wanting something similar to my business cameras, but in a smaller price range. I had looked to update my cameras at my bar and was quoted over $3000, so when I bought the Zosi system, I was prepared to be underwhelmed. Amazing clarity and the night cameras were 100 times better than my ""commercial"" system at work! Install was very simple (running the wires for the cameras was the most time consuming) and setting it up for web viewing was a snap.Then I had a problem. The DVR kept freezing after a couple of hours. I thought ""well of course, look what I paid for it"". I contacted service at service@zositech.com and didn't bother to hold my breath. I have had plenty of experience with Comcast and Verizon and wasn't exactly hopeful.Here's where it gets REALLY good! I had an answer, an apology, an offer for a rebate for my inconvenience, and a genuine fix WITHIN MINUTES! I was completely shocked! They had an update for the DVR, super simple instructions, and not one problem since then. They've checked back several times to be sure I'm completely satisfied and even offered to send out a new DVR, but not necessary, it's been running fine since the update!I've included some pictures of my $$$ system at work compared to the crystal clear view from Zosi. I'll update later with the night view (NO light, incredible view!) because I'm so happy with the system and more importantly, the service.I would be confident replacing my work system with Zosi because I know this company is prepared to stand behind their product. (And the PRICE! I still can't believe the PRICE!)If you've been sitting on the fence, pull the trigger!",,Had this camera setup for a few months now. Worked fine for a while until I hooked my internet up to it now it continually freezes randomly and I have to reset the system. I tried installing an update they sent me and still no luck so now they're sending me a new dvr to see if that works. Hopefully this takes care of the problem. When the system is working though I like it. Good picture and I like being able to view them from the app on my iPhone. Customer service has been pretty good about responding to me and now they're sending me a new dvr so I'm happy with that. UPDATE: the new dvr system has been working well now and hasn’t froze once yet (knock on wood) lol. The new dvr they sent me was definitely an updated one. The looks of the dvr itself is the same but the operating system is definitely an updated version and it works perfectly so far. I’m very happy now with my system and want to thank Anran for helping me out. 5 stars for sure for the product and you helping me out 👍,"The install was pretty straight forward for me. Most anyone should be able to get this set up. For me, the toughest part was figuring out where and how to run the cables. The two coils of 100 ft. and 60 ft. were more than enough for my set up. I did have a problem with one of the cameras not working (see photo). I switched cameras and lines to test it out, with the same results. I was convinced that the camera was defective.That brings me to the customer service. With no phone number listed on their web site, I was forced to email. No response until the following day. So, I went back and forth a couple of times with little to no results. Finally, I contacted the company by way of FB messenger. Again, no response until late yesterday evening. Whoever was at the other end ran me through some testing and sending them photos they requested and to my amazement, we got it working.Come to find out, their support people are in China and that would explain the slow (by my estimation) response. Some of their spelling and wording tipped me off. Once I realized all that, it was all good! The rep that I was conversing with actually knew what they were talking about. Apparently, sometimes a camera has difficulty finding the system, whatever that means.All in all, we're up and running and the night vision is absolutely incredible. It looks almost like daytime. I also have the app set up on my phone and it was a piece of cake getting that going. Just remember that there is a significant lag time with their customer service. Once I understood that, things worked out well.UPDATE: The one camera did have a bug but the customer service response was incredible and a new camera was on it's way within a couple days. I have since installed the new camera and it works great. Based on the customer service response I have upgraded from 4 starts to a full 5 stars.","Just had the system a few days and it’s crudely setup inside for now. Wanted to let it run for a week or so and check the heat of the nvr and the functions of the camera before fully installing it.That being said the quality seems very good, nothing feels cheap. There were no damaged pins on the nvr or the cameras.I do structured network cabling for a global network data company so I’m a good bit above the average user and would recommend this camera system.Being what my line of work is the only thing I am going to change is the cabling that came with the cameras. Typically data cable is 4 pairs and 1 pair is send, 1 pair is receive, 1 pair is Poe and one pair is rarely used.The cables that with it would work without issue but being what I know I’m going to be using panduit cat6 cabling with rj45 connectors.I will update this after fully installing the systemoutside on the house and giving it some more time.Update: haven’t fully installed the system due to winter time weather.It ran excellent inside and did not get very hot at all. All the features and functions work as they should.Want to clarify the above information on the cabling that came with the system. It is very very cheap cable, it will work fine but it’s an odd cable. It only has 2 pairs in it and feels like old style but new telephone cable. I use data cable for voice lines on non VOIP systems so it will work fine. I just prefer to use new cat 6 cable to remove any choke points in the sending and receiving of video information.",2101,361,https://www.amazon.com/ZOSI-Security-Surveillance-Customizable-Detection/dp/B00NBT1W9A/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=home+security+cameras&qid=1640228950&sr=8-10

I was very impressed with the picture quality and ease of the setup. I have a system at my home and it's a professional quality and name brand and does not have the quality pictures as this Hiseeu system. I posted pictures I took from his monitor. These pictures are without a wifi hookup, just from the outside transmission from the cameras to the main unit. Before I installed this system I tested it at my hose to make sure it worked properly and it passed with flying colors. My home is about 3800 sq. feet and of course the cameras on the first level worked fine as being the closest, and to test it further I placed two other cameras as far as I could on the lower level and closed all the doors. Again all cameras produced sharp detailed pictures. I am not a professional installer, however I did install my 16 camera system and am very glad I suggested the Hiseeu system","I bought the DVR with 4 wifi cameras and I really liked the quality of the product, the excellent support provided by johnny and the support provided.

Like all, I was VERY VERY skeptical about this product, just due to the low price in relative to all the others on Amazon and retail store. But thanks to all those that gave this product a positive review, I took a chance and ordered the 8 camera set from here Amazon. First of all, I have been researching this home camera system for about 4 months, reading from the cheapest to the most expensive, almost everyone's review counted, by far this is the best price with the most positive review ratio. So to install, like most have said the instruction was a bit light and not very in depth, almost seem as the writer assumed we have done this before, but can't lower the rating base on their writing skill. the camera was easy to install. I live in a 3000 sq ft single story home, and the control box and power box is located in the corner study room about 7' drop below the ceiling, the 60' cable was just enough to the furthest location, but shy of 15' short of the furthers corner, not a big deal (I have spliced one and added 30' extra length, didn't notice quality difference). the cable and connector quality is GREAT, I have test it in relative to Coax, at 60', its just the same. Night vision, its way more than I was expecting, the only issue, not the fault of this product, is the red LED for night vision attracts bugs and they love hovering infront of the camera at night. Day time, Awsome. The controling and HD box, very easy to use, and YES its a bit slow to respond to command using mouse, but don't compare it to your computer speed. I have added an A/V modulator and integrate it to my current cable system, assigned the camera to Channel 2 , so now I can watch my 8 camera anywhere in the house at any time. I have also went to FRY's electronics and compare, the same 60' cable that came with the camera ran for $24.99 ea x8, that's $199.92 just in cable retail price. Couple of sugestion for those that are installing it. The camera comes assemble, so you have to take it apart for installation, very easy, just untwist the bottom and top cover and the camera will come loose, don't tighten until you have gotten the perfect angle, and don't worry about adjusting until you have setup the app, so you can stand outside your house and watch the app as you adjust the angle. I'm not sure about the screws that comes with the package, I sugest to go to HD or Lowes and get some stainless steel screws, its very cheap, couple of bucks and you won't ever have to worry about it rusting, especially its mouted outside. Also its probably a good idea to get a simple 30 minutes standby UPS to the system, so that when you loose power, ti wouldn't keep rebooting due to bad weather, at least a surge protector. Lastly, depending on your TV, the quality of the video will vary, I have test it with the old SD tv - poor quality, HD-TV good quality, Computer monitor-best quality. If you see Snow on just one camera, you have a loose connection on that camera, if snow on all, its just your video out connection is loose. Good luck DIY.","This is for the 8 POE camera - 2TB system. I wanted a system that was easy to install and not wanting to run separate power lines for the cameras. POE is definitely the way to go. This is overall a good and easy system, and I am very happy with my purchase. Here are some Pros and Cons that come to mind:Pros:- The color picture quality is really good and crisp, especially in daylight. At night / low light the camera automatically turns on the built-in infrared lights - the picture is black and white but is also very clear within the beam spread of the IR lights, which does have a fairly good range to them.- System comes with 8 ethernet cables so you don't even have to buy those.- Ends of cameras where the ethernet cable attaches to is weather proof plus has led lights to show active power being supplied and video data being sent.- Able to block areas of movement so your hard drive is not being filled with video of a tree swaying or a ceiling fan rotating.- You can choose between standard resolution or HD for each individual camera. Standard is really good as is, HD makes it really sharp. However I found that when watching the video feed in real time there is a couple second delay in what you are watching to what is actually happening at that moment when the camera is set to HD. Standard resolution does not have this issue. My home network is very high speed so I know it's not network related lag.Cons:These are minor but were unexpected:- The ethernet cables supplied did not seem to be all the same length. A couple of shorter ones were found when running the cables through the attic. Instead of swapping for one that was longer I just bought a coupler and a 10 foot cable from home depot and finished the run.- There is a rubber-like ring inside the camera mount assembly that the camera sits against for a solid no-movement fit. I found that if I needed the camera pointed at an extreme angle in relation to where the base was mounted I had to cut about a 1/4"" section out of it to allow the cable coming out of the back of the camera to clear this ring without being crushed when you tighten everything up.- In regards to mounting the cameras - they are rock solid when mounted but you are dealing with 3 loose separate pieces (after you mount the base piece to the wall) that have to be fitted together, aligned, and held in place with one hand while then trying to screw down the 3 screws to hold everything with the other hand. This was a pain and a challenge when on a ladder but otherwise doable. If you are missing fingers or have other hand dexterity issues this might be a problem. The plus side is that the camera is nice and tight inside the housing assembly when you're done and is not going to shift at all whatsoever.Other Notes:- Only screw in one screw just enough to hold the assembly from separating in order to fine tune pointing the camera. Otherwise you will NOT be able to shift the camera position due to it being that tight inside the housing assembly.- Use the app (for android) ""Zosi Smart"". Other Zosi apps will not work. Also use this app when pointing the cameras to where you want - makes this part very easy. For PC use the program AVSS. Lots of other Zosi apps / programs out there but these are the only 2 that worked for me for this system.Really Good Customer Support After Installation:I had one camera fail about a month after I installed the system, no video being sent. I worked directly with Zosi customer support via email. I suspect they are out of China, however this was not an issue at all - They were VERY responsive, usually less than 24 hours reply to an email. I worked with Bill, he was very courteous and attentive to the issue. The emails he sent had a lot of good guidance provided. He had me try several different things to ensure it was a bad camera and not a bad cable or port on the main unit, or a setup configuration issue. This back and forth via email was showing me that they were on this and actively trying to resolve the issue. In the end we determined it was the camera itself that had failed and they are shipping me out a replacement. Bill was great and Zosi does support you after the purchase, which is REALLY important.","I bought this system about 5 years ago. During that time, I am on my 2nd DVR from them. The first one stopped working after the first 3 months. I contacted customer support, which is located in Japan so in order to communicate to them, it had to be via email and they responded when I was sleeping because of the time variance. So every question I had, I had to ask and then wait until the next day to answer and this went on for over a week before they finally sent me another DVR. During that time, the DVR went ""offline"" (got the Zosi start up screen) several times, frozen on that screen. Again, had to communicate via email for several days before they finally sent me an upgrade which I had to upload to a thumb drive. That didn't work and again, had to email them several times to get help with that as it wasn't working. Also, getting the system to work with the app to view the cameras remotely was very antiquated and troublesome to get to work. I am very tech savy so it wasn't because I had no clue what I was doing. Fast forward to 2020, and the DVR has stopped working again. I tried to contact support, this time via Facebook messenger and they asked for my order ID right away. I provided it and it was the last I heard of them. I sent several text messages, AND emails with no answer from them whatsoever. I should have listened to the other reviews I read before I bought this.UPDATE: Zosi contacted me and gave me step by step instructions to upgrade the system and was all done via Facebook messenger. The system is back up and running!","Okay, so I've had this for a few weeks now and finally got it installed quite a bit of work running all these cables and hanging cameras Bought this to keep an eye on things outside. Not a problem when I'm not at home, but when I'm at home thing makes so much noise I can hardly stand to keep it turned on. Picture quality is so so, but it does work for what I wanted to do. I would not recommend this to anyone if they're all this noisy I would not have another one and would not recommend anyone else buy it either!

I did not use nor would I plan to use the monitoring service so I have no comment on that feature. The following are my observations:THE GOOD -- Easy to Install. I have installed professional wireless alarm system and for those you need a engineering degree to understand. The Simplisafe is as simple as it needs to be to install for any average non technical homeowner. There are textual and voice prompts that help guide you though the simple procedures. -- Easy to add sensors. Each sensor has a button that when pushed will then pair it with the system then you name it using the key pad. Its that easy. - Easy to name sensors. When naming sensors you can choose from a standard list of names in the keypad menu or create you own unique name using the keypad. -- The sensor devices come ready with self adhesive backing to attach anywhere it is convenient. -- Good Sensor Gap: The sensors to magnet have a inch or so gap before triggering. This is good because it helps prevent false alarms due to window or door rattling during windy days or other events that could shake the house. -- Keypad is easy to use. It has on screen instructions with 4 control buttons on each screen edge that allow you to easily navigate for installation or when operating the alarm. -- Not complicated at all. Just enough user configuration. When Away, just set the time you want to allow to leave before the alarm activates. When Home set it for 0 seconds so that the alarm will immediately activate. -- Smart alarm configuration; For Home the motion detectors are automatically deactivate so you dont need to do anything. -- Opening Warning and Bypass: the alarm will warn you that a window or door is open when you try to alarm it. It will bypass those if you continue to arm the alarm. -- Excellent Long Range!: I placed the keypad and a door sensor about 75ft away from the base station with 4 walls and 1 floor in between and the Simplisafe detected the sensor being opened as well as the keypad was communicating with the base station. -- The system will give you warning when the batteries need to be replaced. -- Attractive Looking: The devices from the Base Station to the window and door sensors are attractively designed in a off-white color that will most decors. -- Several additional sensors are available at as reasonable price: Key fob to arm, disarm, or panic; Smoke, CO, water, temp, glass break, sirens, cameras and freeze. For example an additional window sensor is $15. -- A nice touch is that the system is provided with a yard sign and stake and 2 window stickers, but far to few stickers. -- Reliable!: Update: After 12 weeks of operating the system there have been no false alarms or unexplained behavior. -- Sirens are loud: In addition to what came with the kit, I purchased and installed 2 sirens on the outside of the house. Being battery powered they are surprisingly very loud. The sirens definitely got the attention of the neighbors......a good thing! -- The Key Fobs are great! In addition to what came with the kit I purchased 2 key fobs. You can set or deactivate the alarm with the key fob. Also there is a panic button at the top of the key fob. Its slightly recessed but a finger nail will easily push in the button. -- No Monitoring service required! One can use this alarm without a monitoring service. The alarm will warn you it is not monitored on each activation but that's only the most minor of annoyancesTHE COULD BE IMPROVED: - The Base Station siren is not very loud. The volume of the Base Station is adjustable but even its loudest is not loud enough. While you may hear it when in the same room or small apartment, it will be difficult to hear across the house. In this test an elderly who normally wears hearing aids did not wake up when the Base Station siren went off in the next room. It will really be necessary to add the additional sirens for practical home use. -- No garage door sensor. Garage doors move a lot in the wind and the small Simplisafe door and window sensor magnet and switch do not allow for enough movement to prevent false alarms during a storm or other door movement. This could have been simply solved by providing terminals to the door sensors to allow a larger magnet/switch configuration to be wired to it in lieu of the Simplisafe switch/magnet. - No Heat Sensor. The garage is one of the important rooms to detect fire. Smoke alarms in the garage are a bad idea as they will have false alarms from driving a vehicle in the garage. The alarm industry will put a heat or fire sensor in the garage to eliminate false alarms but Simplisafe does not offer one.Update: I have since installed 9 additional sensors, 2 key-fobs and 2 external sirens. All very easy to pair and setup. Im impressed with the simplicity to install the alarm. The sirens and key-fobs work great and after 6 weeks of continuous use the entire alarm system has had no false alarms or unexplained behavior. Further a very non technical elderly couple who are using the alarm are able to install new sensors and configure the alarm on their own. A testament to how easy the alarm is to configure.UPDATE: During a recent Santa Ana window event a Simplisafe standard sensor mounted on a garage door has worked well even through the storm event. This is due to the large gap allowed by the sensor to magnet mentioned previously before the switch is activated.Conclusion:A well thought through system for the non technical do it yourself installer but fall a little short of a professional system due to is lack of fire/heat sensor and ID of specific open sensor warnings before arming.","I am in love with this system. It was so easy to set up. Literally took less than 30 minutes to get everything set up and installed. We upgraded to the $24.99 a month live monitoring, but a $14.95 live monitoring is also available or you can opt to not use live monitoring. For our needs, we preferred the $24.99 monitoring so that's what we went with, but it's far from being a requirement. The hub has a battery backup option and a cellular backup, so if someone were to try to break in when the power goes out or were to cut your lines you'd still be secured for up to 24 hours. We have a very large 5 bedroom home and the hub has no problem reaching all areas of the home even though we put it by the front door. It still reaches the opposite end and all corners of the house. The setup is extremely easy as is operation. It also came with a yard sign and window stickers, which are an additional benefit and an added deterrent. We were paying ADT over $70 a month. For $24.99 we get the same level of protection with this company and the equipment is just as good if not better. Highly recommend.","Simplisafe is very easy to set up. My Son set it up in about 20 minutes. It works great and has a nice clear picture, easy to arm and unarm. The only thing I was disapointed in was it will not concet to my phone. I have an older smart phone android. It coneccted to my sons new android phone and to my daughter-in-laws iPhone just fine. It is a good thing they live with me. I guess I will have to buy a new phone.","VERY IMPRESSED!! I WAS SO SCARED LAST NIGHT...MY ALARM WENT OFF AT 1:25 A.M...

Great video quality. Easy to setup.,"I bought this system a couple months ago. I originally bought two other systems that arrived with problems, and I had to send them back for a refund. After doing a little more research, I bought this system for my small business. I unpacked the unit and tested it out at home before taking it to the business for installation. Before installation, I chose to purchase a new wifi router, which was quite an upgrade from what was already there, installed wifi extenders where the wifi signals were weak and tested the system and all cameras to be sure everything was working properly and recording. Once I was comfortable with the system, setting it up and installing it in the business was easy. The unit is installed on the second floor, and the cameras on the first floor, all the way to the back of the building, still work with no issues. I did not have to use the extended antennas that came in the box. I did have some questions for the company. The phone number and email are posted here at the bottom of the product description on Amazon, so finding contact information is easy. I chose to email the company, and within 24 hours or less I received a response. I needed assistance getting the system to display on a computer screen. Tech support sent a link to download the software along with instructions on how to set it up. I clicked on the link, downloaded the software, followed the install instructions, and all cameras popped up on our computer screen. The 3TB hard drive gives my business 30 days of recording, which is better than we expected. We have all 8 cameras set to record continuously 24/7. This is a great buy for the money.",I have been in the alarm industry for over 40 years but getting your company to install cameras (even at cost) is ridiculously expensive. I purchased these cameras just prior to our completing a remodel on our home and just started the installation. It was incredibly easy with essentially just plug and play set up. The pictures during the day (and night) are crystal clear and playback is extremely simple. The best issue is that I had some issues with the distance for the wireless reaching and have had incredibly quick response to each and every request for assistance. The system is simple but when there is an issue is is nice to have instant responses to your inquires for help. 5 star customer service and five star system. Really user friendly at all levels and I would recommend to anyone!,"I ordered the security system February 1, 2019 but just installed in on April 13th.

After 6 weeks of use the Battery bar still shows full !!!,"Best buy, value for money, it has everything",Perfect wireless camera,Tough little gem of a camera.,It's pretty good.,"This camera is absolutely wonderful! From when I first opened the box I was very impressed with the packaging and the high quality of materials used to make this product. I could see that much thought and consideration was put into the design. The software installation was a breeze! Once I downloaded the app and turned on the camera, the app immediately recognized the camera and just a few simple steps later my camera was ready to work. I was also very happy to see that I had a few options for mounting the camera and what really made my day was that I was able to mount the camera without having to drill any permanent holes in the walls. (there is also the option to mount it via a screw and hanging it). Once the mount is secure on the wall, attaching the camera to it with the built-in magnet is easy and ball design allows you to adjust the camera angle or remove the camera at any given time.Immediately after I completed the setup and installation, I get real-time notifications when there is any motion detection. As long as I have a stable connection on my phone, I have the option to use the intercom function to speak to whoever is at my door. What I really like about the notification function is that I can go back and view screenshots as well as video. The quality of the picture and video is very good and the night vision function works incredibly well. I attached a picture to this review of my two dogs in a completely blacked out room.The waterproof design is also nice to have although it was not a necessity for me now, it may come in handy some day.I have used the camera indoors at times to check in on my dogs and now mostly use it for the front and rear entry to my house.Now what really surprised me most with this camera is the battery life. I was very skeptic to the claims made in the listing but now after nearly 6 weeks of daily usage and the battery indicator shows full bars! Well, color me impressed!!!Overall it is great for me to be able to see who is at my door, whether I am home or not.One thing I would like to add and I hope the seller can see this comment is that the font on the instruction manual is very very small. I recommend enlarging the font so that it can be easily read by old timers like me.","I recently planned to go out of country for few days and wanted to have a camera to keep an eye on my house while I am away. Once the product was received, my daughter could do the set up in just few minutes using my phone. I installed this in the front porch using the included stickers. Magnetic attachment is super easy to bring in for charging. I didn't want any wiring and any hard installation in the wall. So the set up was really easy. Location of the device is about 40ft from the router. I charged it to 100% though it came pre charged. Picture quality is super clear. Night vision is perfect. Monitored the view from different country for days and the camera still was 100% charged. Very happy with the purchase. Motion activation is perfect, sends a message to my phone. I haven't used the SD card option yet.",,"I know the saying you get what you paid for, and I found this camera to be a great value. The price and reviews were what sold me. My experience is as follows.......First fast delivery with prime. Received and installed 5/7/2019 ...Then my device was fully charged and undamaged when received. Simple directions. Great pics and night vision, easy installation. Motion detection works well as well as the person to person intercom. The camera is also (in my opinion) of good quality, heavy duty. I would say that especially after I dropped twice with clumsy hands (not on purpose) in stalling memory card. Maybe 4’.5” above floor. As far as the app, it works fine , I do wish that you could send videos or pics to email since it is connected to my internet with out taking memory card out... but this is not a deal breaker. I will be going on trip and will test long distance receiving of notifications. One of the neighbors’ kids set it off and I was notified pretty quick. I show that the camera is running at 52% internet signal because of installation distance from router, and still get impressive results. I read somewhere that the battery will or could last to upwards to 120 days in standby operation, .... after trip I plan on making another purchase... I may or may not get a router signal booster, but I am very happy with my decision and experience with this camera. I will post and update on battery performance later when I have to charge again but we all know that the amount of time on live feeds and motion detection will need to be taken into an account... P.S. I will post pics soon.","Surprisingly, this is a pretty good quality camera. I like that it alerts you when theres any movement detected. It recorded and take pictures when theres movement. With that being said you can put an SD card in to save your pictures and videos but theres also a cloud where you can choose to pay monthly or yearly. So you have options to either choose SD or a Cloud monthly/yearly subscription.UPDATE on battery life: I received this item on june 6th but I didnt put it up until june 10th and right now is july 6th. So the battery is at 18% as of right now. So if you use the camera as often as I did(every time theres a notifications due to high sensitivity movements) of course it'll take up the battery. It did however notify me that its 18% and it needs to be charged or it will automatically shut off. Still not bad. Planning on buying another to rotate while the other one is charging. Picture quality is pretty good.On another note, there's a solar for this camera that can be charged without having to take it down to plug in to charge. Less worries about the battery being low and it'll continously charge throughout the day.",13997,2,https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Rechargeable-Detection-Waterproof-compatible/dp/B07PM2NBGT/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=indoor+outdoor+security+cameras&qid=1640228885&sr=8-10

Great video quality. Easy to setup.,"I bought this system a couple months ago. I originally bought two other systems that arrived with problems, and I had to send them back for a refund. After doing a little more research, I bought this system for my small business. I unpacked the unit and tested it out at home before taking it to the business for installation. Before installation, I chose to purchase a new wifi router, which was quite an upgrade from what was already there, installed wifi extenders where the wifi signals were weak and tested the system and all cameras to be sure everything was working properly and recording. Once I was comfortable with the system, setting it up and installing it in the business was easy. The unit is installed on the second floor, and the cameras on the first floor, all the way to the back of the building, still work with no issues. I did not have to use the extended antennas that came in the box. I did have some questions for the company. The phone number and email are posted here at the bottom of the product description on Amazon, so finding contact information is easy. I chose to email the company, and within 24 hours or less I received a response. I needed assistance getting the system to display on a computer screen. Tech support sent a link to download the software along with instructions on how to set it up. I clicked on the link, downloaded the software, followed the install instructions, and all cameras popped up on our computer screen. The 3TB hard drive gives my business 30 days of recording, which is better than we expected. We have all 8 cameras set to record continuously 24/7. This is a great buy for the money.",I have been in the alarm industry for over 40 years but getting your company to install cameras (even at cost) is ridiculously expensive. I purchased these cameras just prior to our completing a remodel on our home and just started the installation. It was incredibly easy with essentially just plug and play set up. The pictures during the day (and night) are crystal clear and playback is extremely simple. The best issue is that I had some issues with the distance for the wireless reaching and have had incredibly quick response to each and every request for assistance. The system is simple but when there is an issue is is nice to have instant responses to your inquires for help. 5 star customer service and five star system. Really user friendly at all levels and I would recommend to anyone!,"I ordered the security system February 1, 2019 but just installed in on April 13th. The system is a Hiseeu with 8 1080P cameras and a 3TB hard drive. The system worked flawlessly right of the box. The video is sharp with great color The night time vision of these cameras is fantastic. This is a very nice system at a good p;rice. I had one question that was answered via email very promptly. If you are looking for a great system at a great price I would highly recommend this one.Jim Davis","Very easy to get up and running.

I am not a “techy” person but I found it very easy to use and set up. Once receiving you must download the app Adorcam and the app walks you through what to do on your phone using QR code’s you just scan with your camera to make things easier. You do need to make sure to buy an SD card, they recommend SanDisk 64 with this or it will only take pictures rather than being able to record video (although you can still watch video live in the app and it will take pictures of any events). I also like that you can set how sensitive you want it to be to motion on a continuum from very sensitive to average sensitivity, to low sensitivity or anywhere in between. It does say you need 2.4G HZ internet connection (not 5G HZ) so that is something to note. Overall I found the product very user friendly and easy to set up and so far it has been working great. Would recommend! If I encounter any issues later on I will update this review.","This is my first camera, so I was really excited when it came. I read everything and followed all the instructions. I had to download an app as well. But back to the camera, every time some is on my porch, my camera lets me know, I go check and I can speak to that person right from the kitchen from my phone, I see them real clean. It picks up all the sounds from outside, so I hear birds chirping and dogs barking. I like it a lot. It’s easy to install. I would buy another for the back yard later, cause the price is great. I also like that I can see when it’s time to charge it from my phone on the app, the battery last for awhile. I charged it the night before putting it up and checked it three days later and it was on like 98% so I really thought that was a plus. The night vision, and picture quality is great. It didn’t take me long to figure it out, it’s so easy to use.","This little camera right here has been absolutely phenomenal!! I purchased it right before going on a road trip (as you can see by all my luggage in the pics) and so I got it in time to install it, which took less than 5 minutes, and the wifi set up only about 2-3 minutes. I left my little neighbors the house keys and in charge of taking care of my dogs, so this was the perfect camera to keep an eye on things while I was away. Little did I know (due to my lack of reading) all the extra perks that come with this baby!The visual is amazing. Full on clarity and quality, not just in full color, but also in the grayscale night vision mode. I was able to keep an eye every now and then on how my dogs were doing and that the girls were doing the job I agreed to pay them $10 an hour to do. Well, I couldn’t just see, I could also hear, and from the sound of it, everything went great! Very clear sound and immediate response time, even when I was over 600 miles away and my then current location’s internet sucked. I could hear the girls had doubts about something, and as I look at the feedback on my phone, I see a little microphone button in the middle. Well, little did I know I could just press that little sucker and actually talk to them in real time, too! And the sound was so clear and no lag in time. I was able to clear up their questions in the moment and everything went smoothly.It was lovely to see that every time the camera detected movement, it recorded, and the playback is always available free of charge! I just installed one of my mini SD cards with 128gb and so I get to keep a record of everything. Also, I get notifications on my phone every time there’s motion detected, and you have the option of silencing those notifications in up to 12 hour increments. What I enjoyed the most is that I never got notifications for my dogs moving around their cages, because those are minimal movements. However I did get notifications for when they walked in the house, throughout the time they were there, and when they left. This worked out perfectly! The recording were done in 10 second increments so it was very accurate. Since I was paying them by the hour, I was able to go back to my recordings day by day, add up the time based on the motions and recordings, and pay them what they were owed down to the exact dollar! This was beautiful! They were happy campers, as was I!!Lastly, I absolutely love that it can be wireless! Of course, I keep it plugged in at all times using an extra extension cord to reach my outlet, but if I wanted it more discreet I can also use it wirelessly. The only thing I can’t vouch for is how long the battery will last per charge, but that won’t be necessary for me anyway. This way I can keep a proper and continuous surveillance of my entryway without any missing dates or times.I have zero reservations regarding this camera. It is absolutely phenomenal, amazing picture and sound quality, proper motion detection, excellent and crisp night vision, and a wonderful app to keep it all together for future playbacks. It breaks things down for you to a great extent. It even tells me when my recordings are due to Motion, due to a Human in the room, or due to PIR, which I can only assume means Pets In Room, but I could be wrong. I can share my recordings, and I can also share my camera as a whole with other family members if they just download the app. This Alkivision camera is definitely the one! Trust me when I say I was taken aback by its performance considering the price point, but when I say it’s better than my name brand products, I mean it! Just don’t hesitate and buy it; You won’t regret it!UPDATE: So a few months ago I accidentally knocked the power USB-C cable and because it was hooked, the force broke the cable and so i was left with no power source. Or so I thought. I had forgotten that technically this camera is supposed to also run on battery, and while before I couldn’t attest to its greatness, now I can certainly tell you that on a full charge, this camera can last you a whopping WHOLE MONTH solely on battery power. I was amazed!! I did have to end up buying a new cable later on, but this was much after the battery had eventually run out after a whole month of no physical connection to a plug.",I love this camera. The picture quality is amazing. There is aa app that you download on the phone and can hear sound from the camera as well as speak through the camera as well. If you do not have an SD card it will still capture photos of the area. I have this at my front door and REALLY am happy that I have it there. i don't have to go to the door not knowing who is there. This camera is great. It has even survived the storms and still going. The battery. life is terrific. It took less than 20 minutes to install and it was super easy.,"The camera was really easy to set up and came charged!It’s super easy to setup… the accompanying app is user-friendly. You can change the sensitive of the motion detection so you don’t get alerted by bugs or leaves and It includes a calendar with snapshots of every movement with options to share or download each picture (which could be videos if I put in a SD card), so if anything does happen, you’ll have the photo of the event.the main page of the app gives an easy way to name the device and add multiple devices — or share the single camera alerts with multiple people in the home. You can even turn alerts off when your home and there is a help page with a live chat I tested out… customer service replied within 2 min and answered my questions.The picture quality is impressive, even the night vision considering there is very little light where i need it.I’m happy I went for the mid-price range and got a camera with lots of settings… totally worth the money.",618,388,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Waterproof-Rechargeable-Surveillance-Detection/dp/B092YVSL2Q/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=indoor+outdoor+security+cameras&qid=1640228885&sr=8-13

I have used 6 in my system to date. The Camera Software has display settings for 8 camera windows, 6, 4, and so on.Third, the Cameras housing, adjustment arm and base are 'cast metal' (not plastic) very well made. I specifically chose ones with good 'hoods' as several of my units would be hit by the sun and typically would bleach out the image.Forth, the camera's field of view is very good and clarity range is as far as it shows. There is no flutter in the images after 4 months installed. The automatic 'white balance' is the best I have seen on NUMEROUS systems including Commercial versions. This comes into play when it goes B/W for night vision. On that note, there is a 'electric eye' on the front that actually switches the Camera mode too which does NOT rely on software to make that determination and uses decades old established 'eye' tech for delay - i.e. doesn't switch back & forth and does not get effected by passing headlights etc. This is the BEST manner in my opinion and you can actually HEAR the switch when you cover the eye with your finger!Fifth, the NIGHT VISION of the camera is exceptional for a non-commercial unit. It uses THREE ""infra-red illuminator"" LEDs (shown in picture) that are very strong (bottom ""led"" is actually the electric eye). The 65 feet is correctly advertised. However there is a hotspot because the LEDs are not shining 'spread out' as far as camera's field of view. This is an issue with ALL infra-red Iluminators as the Infra-red light is such a small band of light energy - that's why your TV remote does not work from a distance or if you don't point it at the TV when your batteries are low. If you need to see further or wider, you will need to invest in separate ACTUAL Infra-Red Iluminators and place them as needed. Note that I have overlapping cameras and each 'see' the others Infra-Red spots.Sixth, Make a CAMERA MAP and plot locations as well as which camera goes where. The system comes FULLY SET UP however, having done this before, I plugged in the entire system on a table, started it up and determined which cameras were 1-8 and LABELED them. Then made sure to put them in the order I wanted them DISPLAYED so when turned it all on, it was only the matter of alignment. I have three in one location alone giving over 180 degree coverage. Those are 150ft away from the base unit and still have a SOLID 3 of 4 bars wifi.Last, I did not need any internet connections (etc.) so have no input there.PS. the noise is typical of just a Hard Drive head indexing and is not loud but it will transfers through its cabinet to a hard surface and becomes a 'sounding board' making it out to be louder than it actually is, which you can fix by putting some soft 'feet' on it. The intermittent indexing does make sleeping around it a little funny. The best step would be to offer SSD when the prices come down as they are noiseless and have a better longevity in a constant ""write"" hard derive scenario such as this.","So, let's review, right?Well, when I bought it, of course the price was right, but I was worried that It was on the cheap side, and that it might reflect in the quality. The answer is NO. This was well worth the value. After 2 years, still working just fine.Now, Let's talk about it.Basically, it's pretty easy. Unwrap everything. Grab a network cable, a power strip, and a HDMI or VGA monitor.Once you have those things, plug it all in. DVR to the network, power and HDMI/VGa and a mouse (included but crap), and the cameras all in to the power strip. Turn it all on at once.When everything is on, the cameras should already show up on the screen in a grid. You have to set a password (make it easy, no keyboard). Then walk through the Wizard. Set the time, give it an IP or DHCP (easy instructions included)**. When it says ONLINE, you are done. You can tweak it anyway you want, but honestly, that's about it.There's also a QR code that it displays to download the app for mobile access, and there is one that connects the DVR to your phone. I dowloaded the iPhone app, then clicked 'add DVR' then pointed my phone to the QR code... and in about 5 seconds, the phone showed my cameras.** If you have a router that supports uPNP, use it. It will make things easier.The reason I am posting a review now is because of a recent issue I had. I came home one night to find the DVR had been stuck in a reboot. It would load the startup screen, then reboot. After an EMAIL to their SUPPORT, I was given some options to reset a setting, reboot, and try again. This didn't work, so they sent me a new firmware. That corrected the problem, and I was back online.In many cases, a company would simply tell me that 2 years was over-warranty. I really appreciated that they were able to provide support.I should mention, they do not speak fluent english, so there was a little assumption and muddling I had to go through to understand some of the instructions, but overall. Very impressed.","I ordered this system last year and to my shame it sat in the box till now. I've had a lot of time to do my pet projects and this was one of them. So finally I got it out and after reading reviews of how wireless camera systems were difficult to setup I was dreading the fight. However, no fighting needed. I hooked it up to the tv and plugged it into 120VAC. I plugged in the cameras to 120VAC in different parts of my house in window locations. I then turned on my tv and switched to the HDMI port of the Control Unit of the system. Once again to my surprise I saw my screen divided into squares for each camera powered up. I didn't fight with it at all! Apparently the system is automatically keyed to recognize its cameras and any extra cameras you try connect to the system must be wired. It is still early in my installation and I am trying things out yet. I ran an ethernet cable to the Control Unit and will be trying out accessing from my phone and computer. It looks like you can manually access it over the internet if you know the IP Address and ports of cameras or you can download the software app and use the software to access cameras and schedule recording. I would recommend this system.","I purchased this system recently for my property,At first I was a little hesitant buying a system off Amazon, but then did my due diligence research on the system and Hiseeu as well as tried asking some pre-sale questions to their support to see how efficient support really was. (They did a great job of answering questions)I have been pleasantly surprised with the system as a whole.Setup was very easy as the cameras come preloaded to match the system. (I encourage a new buyer to setup all of the cameras and system in one room first before installing them, This will allow you to identify camera 1 thru 8; although the cameras can be easily reassigned)Once setup, the Admin Menu is pretty easy to understand and work with, so no difficulties there. The viewing “Phone App’ works well, with sharp images that I can now view when I’m away from the house.All in All, I recently had a 900.00 System that I used, and I have found the Hiseeu system is practically the same and for 1\2 the money,I will say though, that I will come back after a month of operation and either update this review or add a new one so I can comment on the stability and connectivity of the System.Note to Potential Buyers:Read the Product description, Hiseeu offers an additional 8% off if you email them for a code before the sale, To me; that was the final item that had me land on them for a product.",228,53,https://www.amazon.com/HisEEu-Wireless-Security-Surveillance-Pre-Install/dp/B0757FLCRZ/ref=sr_1_11?keywords=indoor+outdoor+security+cameras&qid=1640228885&sr=8-11

Worth buying!,Not bad at all,"Great cameras, at a great price.","This is my 12th security camera install. I have always liked the Zosi brand so when my home needed a upgrade I went with Zosi. To be honest I ordered 2 of the 8 channel 720P DVR + 8 camera setups, just for the 16 cameras. It was just as cheap to order the complete set as opposed to ordering just the cameras separate. I will keep the 2 DVRs for a future jobs.I was disappointed when I opened the box for the dome cameras and saw they where ""PLASTIC"" housings. I almost sent back both systems right there. Zosi in the past has always used aluminum housings on their dome cameras. Plastic will eventually fade and become brittle with UV exposure. I was also disappointed that two of the bullet cameras had stripped screws as I will be contacting the seller directly to get remedied (Seller has been known to have great customer service) I am sure they will work with me to fix the problem.I was pleased with the quality of the 720P vs my old 800 and 1000 TVL cameras. The setup was easy as expected, plug and play and you are done. I was originally worried as I run my cameras through OdiySurveil baluns (See pic) as it makes it easier to run 2 network cables then 8 separate Siamese's (I would highly recommend for any security install, you still need power but easier then ""home running"" each camera feed) Overall I would order the products again. Thanks Zozi!!!!!******************UPDATE***********************Zosi customer service is outstanding, I had 2 bullet cameras that must have been a bad batch and Zosi was quick to remedy the problem and sent me 4 new 1080P cameras to replace the 720P. I have been a life long Zosi fan and this outstanding customer service seals the deal for all my future security camera install needs. Thanks Zosi for being so understanding and just plain awesome!",I bought this about 7 months ago. I had an issue with 2 cameras and reached out to Dealer through amazon. Kelly Chan contacted me and shipped out 2 replacements right away. I understand some stuff is just bad and not the companies fault. I had an issues with my DVR locking up and e-mailed Kelly Chan directly and she had a new DVR shipped to me in about 1 week. I have not had any more Issues and this company's customer service is top notch. The system does what I need it to. setting it up for motion detection is a little tricky but their website has videos to help you through it. Kelly Chan is on my A list for customer service. Job well done.,"Ok. Packaging was nice. The bullet cameras have a metal housing which looks and feels durable. The white blended in nicely with my house (which is also white). The setup was relatively easy. Took a little long to figure out the remote viewing but wasn't too hard. The day quality is really good, Super clearI did have a little issue with some of the dome cameras but Zosi customer service contacted me and was very accommodating . I was able to keep the camera system and they fixed the issue.Definitely worth buying and if you have any issues, Customer service is great (Responsive and accommodating).",considered only going 4 star but i really do like them for the price and they feel like a heavier/sturdier better built camera. added some realistic shots as to what it actually looks like from my DVR,"Most excellent cameras. I got these to expand my system to 8 cams. Well these new Zosi cams are so much better than my Swann cams I am replacing all the Swann cams with these. Wider angle view, much better colour popping out at you. It's a big difference. Given, the Swann cams are about 5 years old. The Swann DVR crapped out so I bought a Zosi unit to replace it. the Swann never really worked right from the beginning. It had major false motion detection problems, making it useless for alerting you via email. It would send tons of false email alerts with pics of an empty yard. Even with the unit zeroed in to small grid areas, tons of false alerts. So it was turned off for alerts. Back to the Zosi unit. So far everything has worked perfectly. With the additional cams it is even better than I've ever had here. Big kudos for Zosi.

I have had CCTV cameras in my house for years. I've been using Swann wired cameras for the most part with mixed emotions. But running new wires to upgrade the system just didn't excite me.I had been looking at NEST cams since I have the smart Thermostats and Smoke/Carbon-monoxide detectors for a while, but the price is ridiculous! Plus your only option with them is cloud service (an additional cost). Then I spoke with a neighbor who sent me a screen shot from his YI camera. I must say, the quality was pretty impressive.So I bought a four pack for $119.00 with moderate expectations. Let me tell you I'm super impressed with the picture quality of these cameras. Set up is quick and easy. When I purchased them I had no idea they had audio as well. The audio quality is incredible, plus it's a two way speaker. Purchased 32 GB SD cards for all of them so I didn't need to use cloud storage and it's been working great! I have them set to record all motion and I usually have about 7 days of history on each camera.Day and night vision are both spectacular IMO. I have attached several photos so you can see the quality both day and night. Side note, I have a couple ""indoor cams"" mounted outside. To do this I purchased a rubber sleeve/cover from Amazon to make the drop cam weather resistant for outdoor application. It's been through rain, sleet and snow with out issue so far. Link to cover: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FD5XHMP/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1A couple cons, the power cable is sooooooo short. I had to purchased longer cables for a couple of my installs. No biggie, they are only a few dollars here on Amazon. The app for iOS is very functional, but it has no multi camera view which would be a nice option.","So I have been using the Yi 1080p indoor camera system for 2 weeks now and I LOVE IT! The camera's are crystal clear during the day and are just as sharp in night mode. The added features of being able to hide any ""lights"" such as the blue power light and the typical red IR lights for night vision makes ""hiding"" these cameras a breeze. The playback function works great and give you the time in hours, minutes & seconds. The 2 way talk feature works great and has 2 modes, 1 is a push to talk feature where when you press the button you cannot hear what the person on the camera is saying and the 2nd is a continuous talk where you and the person on the camera can talk back and forth without pressing any buttons (love this feature) the 32gig on board storage is also a great bonus. Like I said I have been using the cameras for about 2 weeks and have barely used 3 gigs of space. (for an idea of the amount of traffic, it's just me, my wife and our 2 pets) so the cameras don't get a ton of action during the week. But are always recording on any motion. (I do not subscribe to the cloud storage as for I haven't seen a need) Anytime you get an alert it will store it on the app and you can upload it to your mobile device and share it with others. The initial motion detection clip is only 6 seconds, but if you wait till the end of the 6 seconds you will get an option to ""view entire motion"" which will bring up that camera, rewind to when it first detected the motion and play it back until there is no longer any motion, GREAT feature. All of the features seem to work as expected, you can set times for your camera to alert you when it detects motion and zones so that your dog walking around doesn't keep triggering the alerts. I can say the motion detection is VERY sensitive. You can set the setting to low, medium or high but really I can't tell a difference low to high. I have one camera facing out of my front window and it picks up shadows, car lights, leaves blowing, etc. Not a big deal, but on a windy day I can get a ton of alerts. The app works great, you can set a PIN or use your fingerprint to log into the cameras so in the event your phone is stolen, unless they have your PIN or fingerprint they will not be able to pull up your cameras. Connecting them was very simple and took less than 5 minutes per camera. Plug them in, scan the UR code and they will automatically connect to the network your phone is connected to. The packaging was very nice, didn't feel cheap. All cameras were individually wrapped along with all of the accessories. Comes with instruction booklet for assistance with installing/setup. The camera (black part) can be removed from the white base and mounted in different areas. They also sell (separately) wall mounts for the cameras. (cheap, like $10-$15 for a 4 pack) or you can stand them up anywhere you like (they have a round rubber grip on the bottom to help keep them from sliding around. All 4 cameras come with a USB cord and power brick. The USB cord is about 10-12 feet long so you should be able to place these cameras wherever you'd like. OK so I hope this rant...I mean review was helpful. If you're anything like me, I read all the reviews on a product before I make a purchase. Thanks for reading!***(I am not affiliated with Yi or any of there products, this was simple a consumer review, please purchase these at your own risk)***","I purchased the Yi 4 pk. 1080 Indoor security cameras. I was skeptical but am so glad I took the chance. I placed them in various windows facing outside as it’s outside I want to observe. They work perfectly during the day and, where the outside area is lit, at night. If the area is not lit, there is a reflection on the glass from the IR light, but they ARE designed to be indoor cameras. They work very well indoors, day and night, as intended. I have observed some sketchy people that have rung my doorbell when I’m not home (I have a camera in the window next to door), along with the neighbor’s cat, a family of raccoons, an opossum and numerous squirrels. I had an issue where they stopped alerting me of activity (which I see some others have had, also) and contacted Yi customer service. They promptly replied to my request and worked with me to make sure all my phone settings were correct. Turned out, the problem was with my phone settings, battery saver shutting down the app, NOT with the cameras or their app. I especially love that I can insert my own sd cards to save & view past events and not have to pay for ‘cloud’ subscription. I don’t know of another security camera that offers this. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase! In fact, I ordered another set of 4. If you are still in doubt, look up some reviews and comparisons of the Yi cameras on youtube.",,"Best Security Option for a home because:1. Its a one time charge- no monthly subscription- and all of the features of the camera work with the SD card2.

Great quality picture,"Review for: EZETAI Outdoor Security Cameras Wireless, WiFi Battery Solar Camera for Home Security,3.0MP/1296P IP Camera with Siren,2-Way Audio,Night Vision,PIR Motion Detection,IP65 Waterproof,2-Storage OptionsThis solar panel camera works perfectly. The installation was easy, no need for me to do cable management, just drill a couple holes, then screw these things in and wala, they work. Make sure you put it in a place with a good amount of sunlight though (find that place and determining where to put stuff took the longest). The camera quality is pretty great, the night vision, and motion sensing is pretty good too. Overall, pretty amazing product. Connection to the device to my phone was also pretty easy.","I absolutely love that this has a solar panel to charge the battery and have noticed that it charges pretty well even on darker, overcast days. Installation was straightforward and easy enough. Connection and set up weren't too complicated, even for someone tech challenged like me which was really nice. I'm really happy with how the camera performs too, the motion detection setting is really nice, I can customize exactly how sensitive I want it to be. The picture quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, I was actually really surprised and impressed with how good it shows up at night","Ezetai has created a modernistic-looking, lithium battery-powered, full HD surveillance camera for indoor usage. I enjoy the satisfaction of being able to monitor a certain space. It’s equipped with WiFi and motion detection, and allows for remote access from my smartphone! The camera works just as good as it looks, and it looks great!","I love having solar charged technology. This picture is at night time and is pretty darn clear and crisp. There is barely any lag time when I get my notifications.Setting it up within the app was easy. I have my solar panel facing the south where it gets the most sun.

After doing some research I decided I didn’t want to use a cloud based service that would cost me a monthly operating fee. I then looked at the big box stores, but I elected to try the ZOSI DVR wired camera system. Best value and cost by far.I installed the system without any problems. One could just hook it up and it automatically starts recording, or you can use many other useful features. My mom probably could have just plugged it in to record without any reading... if you want other features, some degree of technical abilities is needed.Points to know:1. I created a gmail account just for this and set security on my gmail to low so that the ZOSI dvr was able to use the outgoing mail server without any issues. I could then make settings on the DVR to email me alerts when motion is detected.2. I didn’t use a PC to program, but rather the included mouse. It’s easy. One can then look at a frame and select where in the frame to look for motion and set the sensitivity. This is useful if a frame has trees blowing and cars going by, but you only want an alert if a gate opens.3. I downloaded the ZOSI app for my iPhone and I initially couldn’t get it to work. I emailed their tech support and they were fast and helpful. The manual is not well written and the tech support by email required me to think a bit differently. I sent screen shots and they texted back, “Please use zosi smart app on your phone, your DVR's network is okay, And the e-mail issue, the smtp server is smtp.gmail.com please refer to the below link” I was initially thinking... “don’t they see I did use the ZOSI app? But then I thought to look and there is more than one app... and there is one called, “ZOSI smart” I had ZOSI view. So get the right one! And I quickly said to myself... that’s how I set up the email... but I wrote “google” and not “gmail”. It was easy once I corrected my mistakes. Thank you ZOSI support.4. Lots of options for cameras and DVRs. I have a guest house and a front house. Small city lot, but still further than the 65’ of run for the camera cable. I ended up buying 2 different ZOSI systems. Both are great. The cost is great. The app registers the devices and I can monitor from my iPhone.5. In trying to solve some email issues before contacting their support, I read some posts on setting up port forwarding on your router. Don’t worry... it wasn’t needed. This isn’t as complicated as I was thinking!So in the end, I was able to install 2 systems with 6 cameras and my property is covered! All for much cheaper than a monthly fee based service.","Great system for the price. 1080p cameras and a 1TB DVR for under $200 is pretty good. I have all 4 cameras recording at max resolution and it stores about 30days worth of video before it over writes. Easy installation too.I haven’t been able to get the email alerts to work. The user interface for the iPhone app could use some work. It will freeze sometimes or lock up my 6S phone. Not too often though. I also have the DVR connected to a HD monitor. The user interface is pretty good, it just takes some time to learn how to use all the features.The cameras work well and the night vision is good. If you are covering a large area I would recommend an additional IR flood light for at night.Update..... After about 1 year I had an issue where the DVR would not boot up. I contacted a person named Slina at ZOSI tech support via email and I received a response within a few hours. I was asked to try several things which didn't fix it. I was then asked to send the broken unit back and I received a warranty replacement in about 4 days.I was very impressed with the quick response, level of customer support and the ease of getting a replacement under warranty. My system is now working again and I am a happy customer!","Good set of cameras for Home security. Gives secured 360 view of my home. 30 day recording is a plus. Went with hard wired because wireless camera reception isnt as clear as hard wired. This system also allows me to view my property on my iphone as long as its hooked to the wifi router. Dont let these wack reviews stop you. If you take time to learn this system it can be beneficial. This system helped me stop some kids from hanging out in my yard when we weren’t home. When i showed the video to their mother, she laid into them like Madea.","I like the camera quality, it is clear and very easy to see a close up view. The main reason I like the Zosi is the customer service. I am not very knowledgeable as far as setting up the features, but all I have to do is contact the support people and they are on it. The company has helped me with a replacement when it crashed and when I could not remember the password they sent me the instructions that were really easy to follow and I got into my system. I would recommend this system to anyone.",Very light compared to my previous DVR. Also it is very quiet. Using a mouse to navigate the menu makes it very easy to use. Also the menus are very self explanatory and intuitive. I was able to use my old cameras with the system (saved the cameras the system came with for future use or replacement). The only draw back to doing this is that I do not get sound nor can I speak through the camera for my old cameras did not have this capability but I know that if I install the cameras that came with the kit I would have this capability. The quality of the cameras are plastic and feel a bit cheap when compared to my older ones that are forged metal. The recorder works very well and you can even use your app on your phone to review recordings.,515,108,https://www.amazon.com/ZOSI-Security-Cameras-8-Channel-Recorder/dp/B083DQDWMS/ref=sr_1_7_sspa?keywords=indoor+outdoor+security+cameras&qid=1640228885&sr=8-7-spons&psc=1&smid=A252W7I0ACJHS1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEySFFDUVFHQjNWTVFXJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjU2MzA2MUNMVUMwR0cwUFNVSiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODAzNTA0RE1ERDhNMzFDOUE2JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

They last through snow, wind, rain, and sun. They have amazing low light vision. Clear pictures. And a great setup to last two years on double AAs. And for those who need them to last longer buy the adapter to plug them in. It's stupid how these people come and review these as if they were 5000 dollar security set ups. These are worth it and a great value.",,"We are happy with our blink indoor cameras. It being wireless, light, and battery powered made it easy to install. The motion detection feature allows you to choose sections of the room you want monitored. The night vision is provides good quality captures and we were surprised the battery life is rated for two years. However, please keep in mind that it could change base on how much you use the live view, how often it triggers to record, how long the duration of recording, is set to, and if your wifi signaling is bad.Note: if you have a large area or areas with lots of obstructions (i.e. cement, brick, steel, and aluminum) walls you may want to have a wifi meshed network to extend you wifi network pass these obstructions. We have the Google Nest Wifi system. Also, the blink camera must connect to the sync module via low frequency radio (LFR). Because of this, the camera must be within distance of the sync module. This is separate from your home wifi network. My suggestion is to get another syn-module if you run into issues where your single sync-module cannot cover all camera areas.","The all-new Blink Indoor – wireless, HD security camera appears to be a good product at a reasonable price. I bought a set of three that came with a Sync module. I believe up to 10 devices can be connected wirelessly to the Sync module that communicates using your home wifi. I was able to easily set up the camera using the Blink app on an iPhone. in addition, I was able to link to Alexa using my Amazon Prime account. This helped to view the camera on the Echo View screen using Alexa voice command such as, ""Alexa, show Living Room.""I understand that Lithium AA batteries (supplied with the camera) would last for two years.

Great night vision. I went with hardwired cameras due to their lack of vulnerability to cyber threats. However, the DVR does have an ethernet connection and there is an app you can use to monitor the system. I will continue exploring the cyber vulnerabilities of this system to ensure it does not sell info or footage to a third party. The only gripe I have is that the motion detection is pretty touchy, even at the lowest sensitivity level. One bug flying in front of it and I'll get a notice. I also noticed that if a car drives fast enough in front of my residence, I still get a motion detection notice even though I have removed that area from my camera's detection grid. For the money, I can't complain. Better than paying ADT $40/month to tell me my dog tripped the alarm. Be prepared for a hard day in the attic or crawl space to install, that's the price you pay for hardwired systems.","Our peaceful safe neighborhood has recently become a target for crime. Houses and cars have been broken into almost daily. So we decided to purchase a security system before we were hit. This was our 1st ever security camera purchase. I did not know anything about how to pick one so I did a lot of research and eventually decided on this one. We got the 8camera and 500gb hard drive.It arrived fast and great packaging.Hookup was a bit challenging and time consuming (maybe because this was our 1st) but took a while to get the cords ran. So patience is a plus for all brands I would assume not just this one. But soon that time consuming part was worth it. The picture is crystal clear even in pitch dark. We. Couldn't believe how good it was in night vision. Daytime is just as clear. We have it hooked up to a computer screen that was not being used and its perfect. We have recommended it to everyone . great system, crystal clear pictures and good customer service.Luckily,we have not caught anyone trying to break in our stuff that we have worked hard for many years to get. But if we do we will be ready.Although we have not caught burglars we have caught wildlife on camera. We live in the country/woods type of area and have seen our daily visit from our neighborhood bear as well as raccoon and opposums. I am attaching a pic of the night vision and one of our bear sightings. We only have up 5 of the cameras right now. The pictures are pictures of the screen with my phone but still pretty good quality.","Better than expected! Received it on 5-17-17 hooked it up and the clarity is more than I need. Also love the night vision , also very clear. Was Leary because of the price point but after reading a majority of the feed back I purchased it. Glad I did!","Absolutely worth the money. I’ve had a different swann system and that hard drive fried after one singular storm... this system has gone through several power surges, storms, and a tornado. It’s still kicking. I was able to use those 4 swann cameras with this device for a total of 8, just waiting to find the perfect spot for the last camera. It’s perfect. Easy to set up and use. The app was also easy to set up. Downside is that every time the internet or power goes out you have to reconnect the system to the app, but it is what it is. Not a big deal. I did give the night vision a 4 star because I wish it was just a tad bit clearer. The app has a feature that you can take screen shots and videos of recordings. You can go back almost two weeks. The zoom is incredible. Overall, I’d recommend this to everyone.","I recently got this set-up after attempting a cheaper IP wireless camera. For my needs, the IP camera was a wash and difficult to set up and use. I decided to bite the bullet and spend a little more for this system. I do not regret it one bit! The set up is relatively easy, although wires are almost always a pain. After testing the system, I installed 3 of the 4 cameras. The included cables are more than generous in length. Although the cameras are waterproof, the connections are not, so for the one camera that isn't under the roof line, I did have to get some marine quality heat shrink wrap and a heat gun. All in all, once installed, the system is a breeze to set up. As it has a built in hard drive, it's so much easier than getting a cheaper system that requires an additional hard drive. I like that I can see, playback, and even record segments from my phone. In addition, the included DVR is easy to use and maneuver through.

Recommended hands down!,Excellent camera,Best,"This camera is a huge improvement over the V2. Aside from the wider angle of view (more camera coverage), the night vision is insanely great in color. The fact that this can be used outdoors and can endure the elements makes it perfect.","Update:I use 5 at my house. I like them so much, I installed 2 at my grandmother’s house to keep an eye on her declining health and talk to her. Glad I did! 2 days later she fell and we were able to call 911 for her. I was 90 miles away and able to communicate with the Paramedics and have my parents meet them at the hospital.Original review:Excellent camera and easy to use.I see some reviews complaining about they couldn't get the camera to connect. I had the same issue, but I figured out. These cameras need a 2.4GHz WiFi network with a WPA/WPA2 protocol. Wyze Devices cannot be connected to a 5GHz network. So go into your router settings and change it. Many have the option to run both at the same time, which is what I did.Also, if you're having an issue at the QR code screen, where is says scan with cam. It means the Wyze cam, not your phone camera. Just point your phone at the camera and it will sync.","The image quality is superb. The motion can be separated to detect normal motion or persons which is extremely helpful to minimize false positives. It is tiny, lightweight, easy to install and cheap.The only con so far is a somewhat diminished WiFi range compared to my previous v2 cam; not a whole bunch. However, the fact that this one is weather resistant compensates in my book.Pleased with my camera. Thumbs up for sure.",My wyze cam came in today. Within 3 minutes this tiny camera was up and running. I did already have a wyze account. It had to complete 3 firmware updates. I had to log out of my app and log back in. Once that was done it was set to go. I'm looking forward to seeing the night vision this evening.Remember it will only operate on 2.4,Best camera!

It’s frustrating because most outlets are not near high ceilings or places you would put a camera . So although it lives up to the hype and is truly a GOOD PRODUCT these pictures should be reported for false advertising.","So far so good. We've been using Yi products for a while, but have had some issues with them lately. We hooked these up today and they are just as easy to setup as the Yi cameras. The video is crisp and the audio is clean. I give them 5 stars and will be ordering more once these have stood the test of time for a bit longer.Update: 12/12/20I've been using these for a little bit now and they are so much better than the Yi cameras I used to have. One of the biggest perks is that they do not require that you subscribe to their cloud service in order to view multiple cameras on the screen. Only draw back to these is that they don't have a Windows app to view cameras. Only android and iPhone. However, you download the Blue Stack emulator for windows and it's like having an Android on your windows desktop. These cameras are perfect! Everything about them is so much better than the Yi.","We got these with the vague idea that we could monitor our kiddo and babysitters while out on date night. But with Covid, date night is a thing of the past. Let's hope I'll need these more in the future.I installed them already and actually I've really enjoyed being able to monitor different rooms in my house from my phone. It's nice that you can see the feed from every camera on one screen, or just do one at a time so you can see more detail. The picture is pretty good, clear enough that you can tell what's going on. Sometimes I use them to see how my daughter and husband are doing when I'm at the grocery store, or just to see which room my daughter is in and whether she's making a mess, but that's about it so far. Hoping to get more use out of them in the covid-free future. Anyway, for the price, you really can't beat these.","My husband and I just moved to a much larger city than we are accustomed to and bought this for our own practice of mind when our teenager is home alone. I didn’t expect much since the product was so cheap but let me tell you I was blown away with what I received! The picture quality is much better than expected, the sound quality with speaking through them is great, and the night vision works like a dream! I was expecting them to have cords from reading the reviews and those are the only downside! They are a little short but super easy to hide and extensions aren’t expensive to purchase!

I assigned them static IP addresses in my router so it's easy to access them directly as well with a browser (just look in your router for device called E1 or something like that). When you access them directly via browser you have more control/options than when accessing via the NVR, because the cams have their own internal menus.

I have 4 of the Wyze earlier released cameras and am anxiously awaiting the arrival of their newest camera. Their cameras are small and come with easy to use mounting hardware. I have the cameras set up in traffic areas. When a person enters the area I get an immediate alert on my smart phone. I get a real clear picture of what the camera detected. These cameras have great range and do not loose connection to WIFI like other cameras when on the fringe of a small range from the router. You do need to have cameras in a lit area for night viewing. They do have an add on spot light for one of their cameras and it works just great. I DO NOT use these cameras strictly for a security system. My camera security system is hard wired and works 24/7. IP cameras can alert you to movement, but are only PART of a security system. I would never rely on just IP cameras for security. I hope this helps as Wyze produces some great 'state of the art' technologically advanced IP cameras! You can also use and emulator on your PC and view the cameras from your computer. I hope this helps, I really dislike it when people lacking knowledge about security systems pipe in with misinformation. I installed security cameras in government installations as a subcontractor years ago, and you never loose the basics of a designing a good installation.",Setup was a breeze and the device is scary smart.

This camera seems to go on sale consistently at $34.99 and that's a really good deal when it does..,"KC110Great camera!!! Very simple to set up. Day vision is excellent. Night vision is superior. Pan/tilt is a wonderful feature when you want a full view of the room. It goes up and down, as well as left and right. Zoom is awesome. Audio quality is great. I have nothing negative to say about this camera. The price is unbelievable for the features you receive. The power cord is detachable, unlike their outdoor camera. Kasa app is needed for installation and use. You can set a schedule for record times. You can set zones. You can turn the status LED light off. You can set motion tracking to on where it follows the motion and records. You can adjust the video quality and rotation. You can set it to record video only, video and audio, or not record at all. You can set it to listen for sounds to record. You can set it to record motion that lasts anywhere from 0.1 seconds to 5 seconds. This camera is packed with features! You can even tell Alexa to show it to you on your tv. And she will! It's a little delayed. But it goes through a lot. This camera is highly recommended for anyone looking for these features. I have included a photo with light, and one without for comparison. I'm very impressed.","I just finished ordering a second Kasa indoor camera. The first one is almost a year old now. I mainly use it for monitoring our cat when we travel and to check on the cat sitting service we use.I put a 64G SD card into them, it stores adequate motion detection for my purpose.I usually leave the camera off when we are at home, I don't need videos of us sitting around watching TV.Some people complain the camera makes a loud grinding sound when you pan and tilt the camera. In reality, the camera is very quiet when you move it, but it does have a 2way speaker mic, and that picks up the sound of the motor which sounds loud in your phone's speaker. In person it's very quiet.Another reviewer claims you need to be signed up for cloud service and have your phone on the same wifi system as the camera to use it. That's not true, you can view the camera anywhere in the world as long as the camera is on a WiFi network and your phone has a signal, network or wifi. An SD card stores alerts. 64 gig has been adequate for my needs.To access the SD slot, rotate the camera lens to the top, it's hidden near the base.I'm adding the second camera to watch my cat in another room she likes to hang out in, I'm going to also set it so it has a view of my front door, the pan/tilt/zoom work very well.No need to sign up for cloud storage, in my opinion. If that is something you need, Kasa has it available.I've been very pleased with all of my Kasa devices.For the price, you can't beat the Kasa camera.","I have some other TP Link products and I really like the app so I figured I would try this camera. I was pleasantly surprised at the ease-of-use and the quality of the Video and sound. It has some really interesting features such as the ability to track movement or be set to a ""patrol mode"" where it rotates through various preset views. It can be mounted on the wall and ceiling or just have it sit on a table. The app has the ability to rotate the picture if you mounted on a ceiling. Best of all, I don't have to subscribe to yet another video streaming storage service. I use this occasionally as a security camera, so the free package lets me store Eight hours of video, which is plenty for what I use it for. If you need more storage, you can buy a plan. The camera takes no time at all to put it on the table, plugged it in (It works off standard 5 V USB) And have it up and running. The TP Link app is one of the best smart device apps I have seen. It works amazingly well for the Smart lights then I have and the same app works incredibly well with this camera. I mostly use it for House security if I'm gone, I have also used it to watch my small dog in our backyard. It's fascinating to watch the Camera track her movements around the yard. And if she is doing something she's not supposed to, I just press the microphone button and I can speak through a speaker on the camera.I think this camera is an excellent value. You get a name brand camera with multiple features for a very affordable price Especially with its night vision, I think this is an excellent security product if you feel you need that. Or it can be used as a nursery camera and I'm sure a variety of other uses.",I have a lot of cameras in my house do to having a spectrum childAnd this one so far is one of the best clear picture I went out of town and was calling my daughter she wasn’t picking up I opened the camera saw her in the kitchen pressed the microphone and told her look at your phone I’m calling you and she looked at the camera and went and got the phone loud speaker clear picture wonderful night vision it’s perfect and you could rotate the camera from your phone great camera great price I recommend it,5449,474,https://www.amazon.com/Kasa-Smart-Home-Security-Camera/dp/B08GHX9G5L/ref=sxin_13_ac_d_mf_br?ac_md=1-0-S2FzYSBTbWFydA%3D%3D-ac_d_mf_br_br&cv_ct_cx=indoor+security+camera&keywords=indoor+security+camera&pd_rd_i=B08GHX9G5L&pd_rd_r=d61c41e6-d74a-4355-8c38-6837e24f2f56&pd_rd_w=rIo2r&pd_rd_wg=zzmRE&pf_rd_p=17756b3a-4504-468b-830d-8b5875afd168&pf_rd_r=11MDH9VGECPZAY6F2DYT&psc=1&qid=1640230337&sr=1-1-ed8a42d3-65f1-4884-a3a2-0dd6e83b6876

But a friend convinced me to try the new model, telling me it was so much easier to connect. I loved the old model when it worked...great sound, crisp images even in low light. We use it to keep an eye on our grand baby so we know when he wakes up. But, the old model was so difficult to connect...and disconnected often, generally when I received a message to update the firmware. I had to always plan at least an hour out of my day to get it connected properly as it usually took repeated tries to finally get it established.This model is substantially different than the outdated camera, and wholly exceeded my expectations. Right out of the box it was easy to install. It really is almost a ""plug and play"" device at this point. I plugged it in, and it literally took 30 seconds to establish a firm connection with our home's wifi network. Easy to set up using the QR code provided by the manufacturer. Shortly after establishing the connection, I got the dreaded ""update firmware"" message. I decided to stress the unit even further by trying to update. To my surprise, instead of spending the next hour troubleshooting, within 2 minutes the firmware was updated and the camera back up and running. Tracks motion perfectly, the same great picture and sound. I am so pleased with this purchase! And, an added bonus is that it comes with an SD card, something that was unavailable on the first, outdated model. I will definitely be keeping this one and recommending my daughter to purchase this as a replacement for their camera. Thank you Nooie...you've knocked it out of the park with this one!","This is my third Nooie camera and I love it. All 3 cameras integrate seamlessly into the Nooie app and the quality of the video/pictures are great, including night quality vision. Even without the SD camera, I have the ability to take a screenshot and recording videos directly from the app onto my phone's camera roll. The audio lags a little but otherwise it's a great way to communicate with my cats while I'm not home. Looks very slick too!","I already own the Nooie 1080P so I was excited to so one that has 360 degree movement. My camera is used as a baby monitor so even though the 1080P was placed to see most of the room, I missed being able to pan the room.I received the item very quickly - roughly a day later. I right away loved the packaging, very minimal keeping the waste low. It wasn't packaged with crazy twist ties or excessive bags, very happy!This camera was very easy to install, works exactly like the 1080P. I am happy this one comes with an SD card so I don't need to pay for the monthly subscription to being able to look back on footage.The camera is able to attach to the ceiling which is great for panning the room! How our room is set up though we needed an extension cord to reach and outlet and be in the best position.The app still needs some upgrades but love having access on my phone. The camera pans in the app by touching the screen- a lot like moving around a map on your phone. It keeps it simple and user friendly. Everyone I share screenshots with can't get over the picture quality!Overall, very happy with the camera and the brand.","Wow! We have another Nooie camera that we normally use as a baby monitor that we love - We are 100% replacing it with this! The nighttime and daytime quality are a step above the rest! We love that it has the 360 tracking and that feature has worked seamlessly and as advertised. The sound and motion notifications make it great as a pet cam, security camera and baby camera!The nighttime (black and white) photo I provided is in the middle of the night and it is DARK in that room. The night vision is just WOW!The price is amazing - we have had other security cameras and the quality in this little gem is AMAZING! It takes 5-10 mins to set up and is easy, easy, EASY!

Video quality doesn’t seem to be much better than the cheap wyze cam I replaced with this blink, even after adjusting to “best” quality. Love that it’s wireless and no longer have a 9 foot cable hanging on my wall. App is pretty intuitive. Alexa integration is great. Had an issue with the first cam, customer service was very helpful.","I just want to say for all the people that crap on these cameras, these cameras are amazing. They do the job. They are sturdy. They last through snow, wind, rain, and sun. They have amazing low light vision. Clear pictures. And a great setup to last two years on double AAs. And for those who need them to last longer buy the adapter to plug them in. It's stupid how these people come and review these as if they were 5000 dollar security set ups. These are worth it and a great value.",,"We are happy with our blink indoor cameras. It being wireless, light, and battery powered made it easy to install. The motion detection feature allows you to choose sections of the room you want monitored. The night vision is provides good quality captures and we were surprised the battery life is rated for two years. However, please keep in mind that it could change base on how much you use the live view, how often it triggers to record, how long the duration of recording, is set to, and if your wifi signaling is bad.Note: if you have a large area or areas with lots of obstructions (i.e. cement, brick, steel, and aluminum) walls you may want to have a wifi meshed network to extend you wifi network pass these obstructions. We have the Google Nest Wifi system. Also, the blink camera must connect to the sync module via low frequency radio (LFR). Because of this, the camera must be within distance of the sync module. This is separate from your home wifi network. My suggestion is to get another syn-module if you run into issues where your single sync-module cannot cover all camera areas.","The all-new Blink Indoor – wireless, HD security camera appears to be a good product at a reasonable price. I bought a set of three that came with a Sync module. I believe up to 10 devices can be connected wirelessly to the Sync module that communicates using your home wifi. I was able to easily set up the camera using the Blink app on an iPhone. in addition, I was able to link to Alexa using my Amazon Prime account. This helped to view the camera on the Echo View screen using Alexa voice command such as, ""Alexa, show Living Room.""I understand that Lithium AA batteries (supplied with the camera) would last for two years. Also, there is a USB-C port to power the camera, although no cable or USB charging block is provided.The camera comes with a small mountong bracket and screws for wall or ceiling mounting.15 day trial for storing in the cloud is free and after that the subscription is $3/month per camera or $10/month for all cameras. However, the Sync module has an USB post and a low profile USB thumb drive upto 256 GB may be used to store video clips in MP4 format.My only complaint is that a detailed User's Manual explaining all these should be included instead of finding at Blink support website.",13123,512,https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Indoor-Wireless-Security-Camera-3cam/dp/B07X5FCW3X/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=indoor+security+camera&qid=1640230337&sr=8-5

The set up of the mini was FAR EASIER than the outside cams. I had this thing set up in less than 5 minutes. Picture is good. Sound is LOUD which is what I was looking for.The app however needs some work to support this style of camera. The app works decently for the BlinkXT cameras and functionality, which is motion for most users. As in you get a notification that there is motion, it records, and you watch the recording or live as you please. but it is clunky to get into the Blink Mini for the purpose of continuous viewing which is my intention for this camera, like a baby monitor. Like many other Americans now working from home with a full house of kids, I wanted to use this to assist with keeping an eye on the kids as I worked and record those cute moments. I wanted to use this to visualize a blind spot that I can’t see from the office. I tried mounting it from the ceiling and realized you can’t rotate the video. Mounting on the wall was a little problematic, I couldn’t quite get the right angle needed.Another quirk to the app is if you switch to another app and then come back to the Blink app, you have to hit the play button to resume viewing.All in all, these are minor issues specific to my use of the camera which is why I have it five stars anyway.Hey amazon/Blink, it would be an awesome feature if you’d allow the integration of this camera with Alexa so we can “drop in” and talk through the Echo Dot. Just saying.",I love this lil camera!! Easy to install! Only took 5 min and it works great!! Highly recommend this!!,Great price and product. Connected very easily to my existing Blink system. I am not happy with having to pay for storage after trial ends.,"This is a great little camera monitor. Pros: easy set up, easily managed with your smart phone, clear image quality with motion detection. Can be set up to arm and record at any time. I bought this to use in my master bedroom by my desk where I keep sensitive information.Cons: if you are using it with another Blink product and you arm 24/7 then the other Blink unit also needs to be armed which is an issue because my other unit uses 2 AA batteries. There is no timer on the app to set up a time to arm which would by useful because I sometimes forget to arm at night. It has good night vision quality. It needs to be plugged in so is a problem if you put it in a place (i.e. bedroom closet) if there is no outlet. Because of this, it is difficult to make the camera more hidden (if you are looking for a nanny camera for example).Overall it is easy to use and I would recommend it for a basic home security camera.","SO...I rarely write reviews but was so amazed by this camera I wanted to let others know. I bought the camera after using the Ring indoor camera for twice the price and it made a constant clicking noise with the filter adjustment to light in the room that was a known issue Ring told me and not a defect. I've tried all the other brands out there WYZE, etc and disappointed with all. Then I tried the Blink Mini which I thought was a good price. The setup was a breeze, up and running in 30 seconds. The app is responsive and user friendly. My wifi is sloooow but it still loaded a 1080p HD quality view w hen I accessed it from my mobile app. My favorite feature is the night vision. All my previous cameras just showed a dark room or shadows but this camera shows a clear and crisp picture in pitch black darkness. Very pleased with this and you can't go wrong here.

I have them set up in various locations around the house. The base allows for sharp-angled installations. I have one above my stove and it lays so flat you can't even see it underneath the cupboard. Makes it easy to watch things that are cooking! I also have one facing outside looking through a window. My biggest complaint is that you cannot control the IR light independently from the nightvision mode (black and white). When looking through a window at night, if the IR is turned on it reflects on the window and blocks the view from the outside. I have external IR lights mounted outside so there is no problem with having enough IR light, the problem is that the camera won't go into IR mode (black and white) unless the IR light is on. Not a dealbreaker, I just wish this camera had that functionality because other cameras they sell do.","Let me preface this with Wansview gave these cameras to me to product test for them, however, I’ve purchased Wansview cameras too, so I would probably be giving these a positive review anyway ☺️these cameras allow me to check on my dogs and my house when I’m not home. For example, yesterday I checked on them and saw that someone furry stole butter off the counter. Because I don’t have a cloud subscription I wasn’t able to wind it back and see who (which you can do, but only if you’re either a subscriber or attached to the same WiFi at the time you’re looking).So, I knew what to expect when I got home. The motion alerts are very effective. You can set how and when you’d like motion detected, and at what sensitivity. If you’re connected to your home WiFi, you can even save the video clip if captured, if you’d like. I think the only feature I’d add is noise detection, but that’s just me being extra. For the price these are high quality with many well done features.I attached screenshots of what the camera view looks like in light vs dark.overall a very good experience for the price of all four. I think overall I like their cameras that can move around the room better, but for these not having that feature, their frame of view is still very wide!If you’ve made if this far, you should buy them already.","These four K5 model cameras are surprisingly good. I have had three Wansview IP cameras (an outside fixed W4, and two inside Q5 models that move) and had a few locations that I needed to cover (at 4 different wifi zones at different addresses). All the cameras installed immediately and smoothly, and provide a remarkably large field of view. There is some ""fisheye"" effect in an auditorium that is 80' long, but with good lighting the view is clear and the zoom allows closer inspection. Night view (inside) is ""good enough"" to tell if there is something amiss, but of course, no color. The camera does seem to gather more light than the human eye, so it is actually better than being on-site. Sound is surprisingly good - I can hear and be heard by an associate some distance from the camera. I've had the inside fixed units only a few days, but have found the rotating dome cameras to be quite durable over the last year. Good value. Didn't have to purchase any subscription on their cloud to meet my needs. I don't bother with motion sensor feature and alerts, but found they worked fine with my outside cameras (except for moths at night). I can view all 7 units on my phone and tablets anywhere I have signal. I would sure like to have a link to accomplish this on my PC. I was able to share at least one of the camera views with an associate that also needs to keep tabs at this location. That is a handy feature of the Wansview Cloud App.","I have previously bought other Wansview cameras, both indoor and outdoor models, so I already had their app on my phone which made it easy to setup these K5 cameras. Having been very pleased with my other Wansview cameras for performance and dependability, I decided this four-pack would be great to put on four of my window sills looking through windows to serve as security cameras. Their wide angle view is great for viewing a sizeable area, and I am able to view either short clips of movement via the Wansview cloud or video captured and saved on the optional micro SD cards, giving me a complete recorded view of activity around my house. For the price, I am amazed by how fantastic the monitoring is that I now have. BTW, when my daughter found out I bought this set of cameras, she came over to watch the setup procedure. She was so impressed by how easy setup was and also the quality of the video along with the features on the Wansview app that she plans on getting these same cameras to use with a couple to look out her windows and the others to monitor her cat.","This camera package is a very good deal. I don’t know how to use them with Alexa but there is no need, I can do everything manually from my cellphone. I got these cameras a day before my vacations to Mexico, installing them was very easy, when I was in vacations being able to see what was going on in my house and specially with my cat gave such a peace of mind. These cameras doesn’t pan so you have to place them in a corner they give a very wide vision of the room and the image is very good. Definitely recommend them.Este paquete de camaras es un buen deal. Yo no sé usarlas con Alexa pero no es necesario, todo lo puedo hacer manualmente desde mi celular. Las cámaras llegaron un dia antes de mis vacaciones, fue muy fácil instalarlas, cuando estaba en mis vacaciones y poder ver lo que estaba pasando especialmente con mi gato me dio una super tranquilidad.

Build quality and image quality are excellent.,I swapped a Pro2 for a new Ultra2. It was easy to setup the new camera in the Arlo app. The camera position tool in the app made it easy to position the cameras view. The video quality is very good with some slight chromatic aberrations at high zoom levels at 20+ feet. The detection algorithm is also very good. It recorded a squirrel and correctly flagged it as an animal. Distance to the hub is probably 30-40 feet with one exterior wall in between.,"Unlike my experience with Arlo's wired doorbell and chime, the Ultra 2 cameras work fabulously. The batteries do not last the advertised length of time. Knowing that I ordered two extras and the charger. The main camera battery had to be exchanged every two days and the secondary camera in our carport every five days. I installed a third-party 3 watt solar panel designed for the Arlo for each camera. The solar panels keep both batteries charged at 100 percent. I think it will be a pain to review the recordings on the base station's mini SD card, so there is no question in my mind that customers purchasing the cameras will also need to purchase Arlo's cloud storage service once the free trial period is over. Customers need to have reasonable expectations. I have my camera's set at the best quality settings, but still, don't expect to be able to read license plate numbers, and the ""color"" in nighttime recordings is very marginal.","I purchased the Ultra 2 to replace an aged system. Once you see the video, you'll declare 4k video is the only way to go. I installed the two cameras outdoors myself, and I am far from being a home improvement guy. You'll love it. I also watch my camera feed at night on my Amazon Echo Show. Be mindful there is an update package for the cameras and the base. Do the quick download before installing.

These cameras are wonderful and the price you are paying makes them even BETTER! They have great quality and set up takes no longer than 5 minutes! Upon receiving the cameras (in a timely manner I might add) they were nicely packaged with an instruction manual that made set up easy and quick. The longest set up time was finding where I was going to put them! The adhesive 3m tape worked great as I stuck it to the side of a wall and I haven’t had any problems. The app is the third one down in the App Store (I have pictured the correct one for reference). As you can see in the live shot I included the image is clear and the two way sound works wonderful. I love being able to check in on my dogs all day when at work and being able to speak to them through the camera makes things ten times better! Definitely recommend this product!,"Pros: the picture quality on these is wonderful. I can see everything so clearly, even with the night vision. The microphone works well too. It’s 2-way. The instructions were simple and very clear. I love that this comes with both the micro SD card option and the cloud upload option for recordings.Cons: completely user/reader error... I didn’t read the product description very carefully and thought these were outdoor cameras. They are not. I also thought that “wireless” meant cordless. Not the case. These have to be plugged in to work. Both were not a deal breaker. I found a great use for them indoors and they were easy to install with the plug attached.If you are looking for an inexpensive way to feel secure, check in on animals or have a baby monitor, these are definitely the way to go.","If you're looking for something super simple and affordable for piece of mind this is it. I'm honestly impressed with the image quality for the price. Night vision is pretty amazing. Picture shown of my room is dark but not pitch black, outside pic is pitch black. Alerts work well, annoyingly well, but you can adjust sensitivity or set a schedule etc. Love the fact it comes with two 32gb memory cards so you're ready to go out of the box. Set up was very simple. Literally download the app, plug in camera, pick up camera and scan a barcode that pops up on your phone to sync and you are viewing live. Playback is my only gripe because just the smallest slide will fast forward or rewind by a few minutes. Hard to pin point exact times, not impossible. Might be better to have it just record on movement detection but i just keep it on full time. Speakers work very well, can talk to my dog while he's on my bed. This was a deal breaker lmao. You can also hear from the mic in the camera so you can use as a baby monitor or hear your wife's boyfriend. I know these are indoor but I put one against a window and it worked perfect for daytime but at night there was nothing but glare from the ir light. I just decided to say screw it and mount it outside under the car-port where things don't really get weather damaged. Seems absolutely fine this morning: no dew in the lens or anything and I added pics just to show. Will update review if I totally screwed up but with the price I doubt I'll get too mad either way.Edit: about a week outside under the carport and no noticeable difference or damage whatsoever. Working perfect.. Would not put it somewhere it can get rained on for sure. Will update again after a whileNew pic added at midnight still going strong outside. Keep both cameras on event recording and playback is sooo much better.5 month update! New picture added with timestamp for proof. Outside camera still going strong. Noticed recently it was going offline occasionally and figured out it was the power cord going bad from the weight of the extension cord pulling down on it. Micro usb are used for everything so really not an issue, most people have a thousand of them these days. Bedroom camera still great because theres no pressure on that cord.. Other than that literally no problems other than the occasional alert from curious critters :)",I own 2 Wyze cams and several eufy cams and I like them both but the quality picture on these cameras tops them both. The pictures on these cameras top the Wyze cams and match or maybe exceed the Eufy for quality. Ery pleasantly surprised these cameras.Highly recommend.,"These are great cameras for the money, the setup was super simple, and the app is easy to use and doesn’t glitch out or anything.

Great camera.,Just in time!,I can't say enough good things about this camera and company,"I’m a very big tech junkie and am very intrigued by Ring. I first bought ring doorbell 2 and loved the product and app so I went and purchased the Ring Spot light cam wired. The reason I opted for the wired version was I don’t like messing with batteries, however if I were to buy the battery version I’d buy the second battery pack to eliminate down time. The wired version is nice as your getting constant power. Then camera also starts recording motion faster with the wired version versus the battery version.Setup: super simple follow Ring app instructions and you’ll be up in running in 10 mins or lessInstall: I live in Nevada land of stucco homes so it takes a little longer to drill holes and place anchors. The ring mounting bracket comes with a level built in to make install easy “Pro tip I learned from my door bell” once you have the mounting bracket level I used a thin nail to start and mark my pilot holes for when I had to drill, which made the install even easier. Once you have the holes drilled anchors in installing is a breeze. The most time consuming part well for me as I’m OCD is space the holes for the cable clips. Overall the physical installation took 20 mins do to me being OCC. the cable is paintable to match your house. My stucco is white so it was a non issue.Functionality: in order for Ring,Arlo,Nest ect to work properly will require good WiFi and a good router. All these web based on demand cams require good WiFi if your WiFi or router isn’t up to par you’ll have a bad experience. I run a NetGear Night Hawk Router that I can pick up WiFi halfway down my street so no range extender needed for me. If you have a big house and your router is on the opposite side of the house from your cameras either buy the chime pro extender or better yet by a mesh WiFi like EERO or Orbi or googles mesh routers “you’ll thank me” the better WiFi signal the better your devices will operate.The App: The Ring App is super easy and user friendly and about to get even better here with new updates and usability. The app allows you to manually turn the lights on and off sound the siren create customized motion areas “a feature the battery version doesn’t do” as well as set the motion distance for the lights to come on. While reviewing a motion activity or in live view you have the option to turn the lights on or off as well as sound the siren. The app also keeps you informed of any issues with Rings servers or any downtime or issues with devices. The Ring cloud service is outstanding and it’s very reasonably priced at $3 a month which is cheap. I don’t need 24/7 video I only need motion events so $3 a month is a great value. The motion or activity alerts are fast and show up on your phone quickly. The two way communication is nice and clear to tell would be questionable people to buzz off if not the alarm will scare them away and wake your neighbors.Overall I am very satisfied with my Spotlight cam wired and my ring doorbell and plan to add more ring devices very soon, with the upcoming software updates from ring the experience is going to get even better. Again I can’t reiterate enough you have to have good WiFi and router for this device or any of the competitors devices to work properly. I’m a very very picky person with electronics and can say Ring Spot light cam wired met and exceeded my expectations.The neighborhoods feature within the app is also a great tool to keep you informed of activity or events within your community. Again I highly recommend this product",,"I have 4 ring Floodlight cameras in use at another property. I really like them so I was excited to see the new Spotlight camera added to the ring lineup. I tried the ring Stick Up Cam Solar prior to ordering the Spotlight and I ultimately returned it due to being spoiled by the better build quality and overall camera quality of the Floodlight Cam. I included photos to show the field of view comparison between the two. While they aren’t installed in the exact same location, you can see just how much better the Spotlight Cam looks. As expected, the light output is greater on the Floodlight Cam but the Spotlight Cam does a good job of lighting up the immediate area around the unit. After installing and using my first Spotlight camera, I promptly ordered a second and installed it as soon as it came in. Both have been operating as expected. The camera video quality is great, the field of view is awesome. I have already influenced at least one friend to buy a wired Spotlight Cam and he is just as happy with it. I do wish that ring would add some more customization to their iOS app. It would be great to be able to reorder the cameras in any order you want vs left to right based on order of set up. It would also be nice to know if the motion detector triggered the lights or if the lights are on for extended periods without having to open the app. I found that after losing power at one property while not there that the lights stayed on after power was restored. I just happened to notice they were on when I was in the app and had to manually turn them off. HomeKit compatibility would rock too! Anyway, the Spotlight Cam is great! Way to go Ring!",,,9137,1,https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Spotlight-Cam-Wired-Plugged/dp/B0756P26HL/ref=sr_1_22_sspa?keywords=indoor+security+camera&qid=1640230337&sr=8-22-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExSFlSUkY0TERUREdDJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTY0ODU4MzZCQVk5M0xXMDdMSiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDY5MTcxMlZWRjdQSDBJTE9OMSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2J0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

Highly recommended","I am having a new house built and decided to pre-wire for a POE camera system. I ordered this one for that purpose, and was able to test it out in my current house without permanently installing it (yet).Having only had experience with simple cameras like my doorbell cam and a little Blink camera, I am really impressed with this system - it is a serious tool for security and surveillance.Setup is straightforward and the documentation provided makes it simple. The hardest part will be to run the cables through your house, but I'm having that done by pros while my house is being built. POE means it is powered and connected via standard network cables with only and RJ45 connector needed. There are other options (standard switches plus barrel-connector power, or your own POE switch), but it's easiest just to run them back to the main NVR unit. Once physically connected and powered up, there's a simple wizard that you go through to set it up. You will need to provide a computer monitor, but that's about it.The picture quality is impressive in just about any kind of light. I love that it lets you have extremely granular control of event detection (people, vehicle, etc.), motion detection (multiple zones per camera, sensitivity levels, etc.), system settings, storage, and backup. You can also activate a loud audible alarm and warning lights to scare off would-be criminals.Playback is really cool, with colors showing various kinds of activities, the ability to zoom, freeze, take stills, slow mo, date/time zoom, etc. I am still learning how to use it, but in any case it would be really helpful from a forensics perspective.The Android app worked pretty well for me on a Samsung Note 9, despite the low ratings on the Google Play store. It worked fine even over a decent 4g connection for both live view and viewing recorded data in the past. You don't have the granularity of control using the app that you do directly controlling the NVR, but I believe for any day-to-day use of the system, the app is more than adequate.I wish the interface didn't you make log in as frequently as it does, or used a simple PIN or something, but that's a minor issue and actually increases the security of the system a bit.I did not test the door/window sensor or the motion sensor, especially since I use a different alarm system currently, but I might find some creative uses for these in the new house. You get 2 sensors (good for a front and back door), as well as the motion detector - enough for decent home security if you don't have a separate alarm system. These components seem to work with the mobile app, but doesn't directly integrate to the local NVR system as far as I can tell from the docs.I can't wait to get this installed in my new house and use it in a real production environment. This is not a cheap system, but you get a lot for the money. If you are a ""power user"" who likes to control and tweak things, or you just don't want to mess around with charging batteries on a fleet of cameras, I would definitely recommend this system.","Okay, I have had the chance to play around with a few security systems here and there, looking for the best install. This one, so far, has them all beat! This system is solidly built and super well designed. It is easy to set up, but it does take time, especially if you want to properly install all the cabling in hard to reach or “invisible” to see locations.Setting up the app is super intuitive, and I haven’t even begun to play with all the bells and whistles it comes with! Images are sharp, although you get a little grainier at night (which is common), but not as grainy as I have seen some cameras produce. The 2-ay sound works great. I even love the alarm system that you can set off to scare away intruders! Very solid system and worth a look.","When I built my house five years ago, I pre-wired for a four camera system (different brand) and so far I've been fairly pleased with it.Ever since moving in, I've wanted to expand that system, but that meant purchasing a newer 8 camera, NVR and up to four additional cameras.When this camera system became available, I figured that instead of expanding with more cameras, I would just replace the old system (with it's older technology) and I could re-use the old monitor along with some of the cables. Well my old monitor has worked good for four cameras, but I decided that it would have been way too small for eight.Plus, the old camera cables are not compatible with the new cameras.So, instead of replacing the old system, I then decided to install a second camera system, and I'm so glad that I chose that route.I will soon have two, stand-alone security camera systems, with a total of 12 cameras. Plus the new monitor is hanging in the location that I had wished my old one would have been.It'll be a few more weeks before I have this new Lorex system completely installed, but so far I'm really impressed with the equipment.Every single item inside of the box has a look of quality (way better than my old system) and other than having to install the cables, this should be a fairly simple and easy project.I will be using all eight of the new cameras, connected to a 27 inch monitor, and also using the ""smart"" feature to view each camera on my cell phone.The installation instructions are outstanding, and so well written, that following the step by step process should be a breeze.Although it's still too early for me to comment about camera clarity, night vision, etc. what I've experienced so far has been impressive.","Well worth the cost.

This camera is better than all of them. Great picture and options.This camera is very well built and most importantly, the mount. The mount is very secure and feels beefy. Once tightened, this camera doesn't move unlike the others i have.This camera integrates with Alexa and is easy to setup. As usual, create an account and link it.Multiple resolutions to choose from. You can choose from 1280x720 (720) all the way up to 2688x1520 (4mp).This camera offers cloud storage with motion detection. It allows you to the motion detection area.For the price this camera hands down is worth the price.Please understand before you buy, this camera needs a Poe switch to be powered up. As cheap as these are this is no a deal breaker. Amazon has plenty nicely priced poe switches to choose from.Let me also add, this is a well built camera and mount. Bigger than I thought but not huge.","I didn't know anything about purchasing or installing a camera like this but I knew I wanted a hardwired camera so I would not have to mess with recharging or batteries. I researched cameras on Amazon and YouTube and learned about a PoE camera (power over ethernet). It was so easy to install with just running a coax cable ( used cat 6) from the camera to an additional item I needed, a PoE switch that I purchased on Amazon and a short coax cable to go from the switch to my router. That's it. I also purchased a 256gb SD card for continuous recording.I used the Amcrest Pro View software on my iphone and tablet and the Amcrest Surveillance on my desktop (both versions are free). In hindsight it was super easy to install but at the time it was a learning experience. I probably spent two hours installing the camera and hooking it up and another 3-4 hours getting to know the software. The Amcrest quick start guide and the website both contain a lot of information.The wide angle lens is a huge plus in my situation, I would not have been happy with just a narrow view. Running the higher resolution gives a fantastic view. Using the SD card for recording means I don't need a cloud service but I can still view the camera remotely.Overall I could not be happier with the camera and would recommend it for easy installation and great view.","With all wireless options that are offered today, it is good to always have a hardwired camera; but even better if only an Ethernet Cable is needed, higher speeds, independent of interference and issues with water in the antennas.This POE enabled camera is super easy to set up, the APPs (cloud and ViewPro) are easy to use and follow without much need of configuration, but if needed there are tons of features you can configure to have a very professional setup or just a simple home security camera system.Even it has a great angle view, when in dark environments the images are not perfect from far, but is very good in short distance, so from the price point of view is 100% worth it. I like a lot that you can switch quality modes since not all the time you will need the higher data bandwidth consumption of an HD video. What I would love to have from Amcrest is to have an app compatible with Fire TV, that way you can have a full view of your cameras not only on the computer or smartphone but on your TV as well. Attached 2 pictures of the camera view.NOTE: I'm using the POE Switch from Amcrest and as well super simple to use, I will need to dig more into it, since I want to try the length of all 4 ports used with cameras at the same time, expecting to be able to run up to 100ft each.","The price and quality of this camera makes it a good deal compared to more expensive brands. You are going to get a higher resolution for a better price. The setup of this camera is straight forward: Plug it in, run the app to find the camera, add in to the app, and view. You can hook this up to a NVR or just a regular switch to view Live Video.The App for mobile devices is practically the same you will see across other brands, but seems a bit better, is easy to use, and setup. Follow the instructions Amcrest provides with the camera andSetup took no more than 30 mins to have live viewing on your phone and/or Computer. I tested the Power-over-Ethernet (POE) and the Power directly to the camera if your switch doesn’t have POE, both worked great.I have the Camera hooked up to a Network Video Recorder (not Amcrest brand) and it works great, which is a big plus if you are looking at switching brands. Great to see that Amcrest is ONIVF compliant.Only Con is the IR light is not the best for a large outdoor areas at night, if you are trying to illuminate a large area in dark hours try to find a model with more than 98ft IR Distance. Amcrest has models with 131 ft. and 164 ft. IR distancesPros: Price, image quality, ease of setup, ONIVF, need to buy Ethernet cableCons: IR isn’t the best, Amcrest watermark on video.","I have set up over 20 Amcrest installations, and about 10 installations of other types. I prefer the Amcrest for picture quality, build, and durability. I have included some pictures taken with the UltraHD 5MP Outdoor POE Camera 2592 x 1944p during both day and night, in an environment that showcases the camera's quality. Both the day and night footage is exceptional.These camera support native POE, with the ability to get power using a wall-wart. They include necessary hardware to water-protect the cat5 cable. The Camera case and base are made of cast metal, and has a single Allen bolt that allows easy positioning of the camera. Once the bolt is tightened, the camera will not move, even in 40mph winds. (no vibration) The NIGHT Floodlight does not have a red glow, like my older ""Vandal Proof"" Amcrest; so it is invisible at night unless you know where to look. The lens and the light share a common optic, but the lens is against the glass which removes ghosting caused by internal reflection. Also, the wavelength of this light does not seem to attract insects. As the picture shows, the Night vision almost looks like far infra-red. Both pictures were taken from a screenshot of the video, night time, was taken in the rain.The Crispness of the video shows a solid 25fps to my NVR, and it also supports backup recording on the camera itself. This camera does not need the special Amcrest plugin to access making it much nicer then their older offerings.Motion Detection is also pretty standard, it is very sensitive which can be a pain in the butt, but if you are utilizing a NVR, you can set up zones, and adjust your own sensitivity. The camera may also have a way to set up zones, I did not check.Amcrest provides an app which allows you to view your camera on Android and Iphone at no extra cost. You will need to poke a hole through your firewall unless you use their cloud service. (Which I do not)I will be purchasing more of these cameras in the future as I believe their price and performance is unparalleled.",508,128,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-Security-Waterproof-5-Megapixel-IP5M-B1186EW-28MM/dp/B08K1M34ZQ/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=ip+security+cameras&qid=1640229951&sr=8-16

Overall, the installation process is fairly easy, but it can take time depending how you want to mount your cables. For me, I had to go up into the attic, which was the only cumbersome part about it.All you need is a PoE switch and some Ethernet cables. I'd recommend buying the cable that comes in roles, without the connector (R45) piece. Otherwise, you're going to be drilling 1/2'' holes in whatever you decide to put the cable through. This was my first time installing wired cameras, and they turned out amazing. The trade-off with much higher image quality pays off - even though installing is a bit more time consuming. With Wifi cameras, it's easy installation, but the headaches are far much greater with connection, resolution, and pay-based cloud storage. With these Reolinks, all you really need is an SD card & Poe Switch. The SD card allows you to erase, store, and transfer files through a computer or off your phone (FOR FREE).The only negative thing I encountered was with one camera. The little ball joint that allows you to maneuver the camera broke off a piece of the sleeve. I contacter Reolink, and they're supposed to be sending me a replacement.Main thing, do not overlook these cameras. At a 2K resolution, this is all you really need. Great night vision too!","I don't know where to start, but overall I'm impressed by these cameras.Pros:Wide FOVGreat night visionGood Motion Detection settingsAmazing picture quality in daytimeMany apps or programs for different platforms with lots of settings from motion settings to white balance, etc.Cons:Confusing sensitivity settings, had to refer to a article to determine my settingsNight vision has a ""Casper"" effect where it washes out a person's face with built in IR. With LIFX+ Bulbs it fixes this.Does not include POE injectorsOverall setup was straightforward and getting the SD card formatted was easy. I would recommend getting LIFX+ Lights as an alternative Infrared Light Source to stop the ""Casper"" effect and keep bugs away from the camera and building webs in front of the camera lense.I don't know if it's my setup but the Windows Program disconnects from the cameras periodically and reconnects but if you leave unattended you might have to reopen the program. Like I said I think it's my setup and nothing to do with the program.This is an unpaid and honest review, I will update if I have any further issues. 5/29/19",Easy to install.Great instructions.Exceed expectations for the moneyI added 2 5mp cameras,"How the prices of IP cameras have fallen over the last several years. I remember buying 720p IP cameras for over $150 back in the day, and now we have this Reolink 5MP (which is slightly larger resolution than 2K) for $50. Craziness! Don't hesitate buying this excellent camera. I have 2 of these, and 5 of the previous 4MP versions, connected to a Synology NAS running Surveillance Station and the results are nothing less than perfect. 2K resolution at 30fps all across the board, clear and precise daytime footage, and decent night time IR (even better with an IR blaster, as are most cameras). The Reolink web UI is simple and easy to use, and the ability to do DDNS natively is nice for those who don't use a NAS or computer with their cameras.One note for Synology users: Synology does officially support the 4MP RLC-410 model, but with this 5MP version you have to adjust a few settings. Specifically, the low bandwidth stream in SS does not match the camera's native settings at 4MP, so the camera has to be set up at 5MP to enable that second stream. I prefer the aspect ratio of 4MP, so I just disabled the low bandwidth stream altogether, and then the camera activated properly in SS. Synology might patch this in a future SS update, but for now the fix is quite simple.Bottom line, the RLC-410 is an excellent camera and Reolink remains the brand to beat in the value IP segment.",I bought these wanting to be able to monitor activity at a remote location. They were easy to install and have been working great. I get notifications of any activity in their field of view. Picture quality is good and the SD card seems to hold plenty of activity clips. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for an in-expensive camera solution without having a monthly subscription. Price was very reasonable.,1467,165,https://www.amazon.com/Reolink-Surveillance-Security-Detection-RLC-410-5MP/dp/B07DFKTKGG/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=ip+security+cameras&qid=1640229951&sr=8-19

Both of those systems had big issues, like losing all cameras for no reason, losing one camera that required daily reset and reconfiguration, etc. Not so with the Lorex. This is a great looking system and super easy to install. The app is much better too and gives me fast easy access to cameras remotely. One thing I noticed was the 4K cameras produce a much better picture than the Reo system did, but both are suppose to be the same picture quality. The Lorex six camera system cost about the same as the Reo four camera system, so to me it's actually a better value for the money. Also, I really like the added white LEDs on the camera that turn on to warn a person who enters the sensor area that yes, there's a camera and yes, you're already recorded on the system, so ""Smile!""","Instillation was fairly simple and required no calls to tech support, Major plus in my opinion. Picture quality is excellent and the night vision works very well. I’m still exploring software setup options and tweaking settings to meet my needs. The Lorex Home mobile app functions well and is a nice feature to have. If this new unit works as good as my previous still working 12 year old DVR did it’s a 5 star for sure. Main reason for upgrading was improved picture quality and the NVR POE cameras capabilities.One recommendation for Lorex would be to included a couple 100 or maybe 150 ft cables for the cameras. I found that the included 60ft cables were adequate for 4 out of the 6 camera runs, and would probably meet most home owners needs. In my case the runs were between 20 and 150ft. Although this is not a deal breaker and cables can be easily made or purchased for longer runs, it would of been nice.","These are incredible cameras the best I ever had, Night Vision Works flawlessly facial recognition vehicle recognition all the bells and whistles.","Very happy with this system pros great quality picture, night video is good quality.

My Amcrest NVR usually doesn’t play nicely with other cameras but with some minor tweaking I got this camera up and running and hasn’t had any issues. (I’ve tested other cameras that would crash the remote app or just straight up not work).A few of the major things I like about this camera vs the Amcrest cameras I have is that I didn’t have to install any third party software to login, configure, and view the cameras. To me that’s huge since I’m always weary of that. Secondly since my day job is in IT I always worry about products “phoning home” and I have been running the cameras almost two weeks and so far they have not reached out to anything that would be an issue. (I’ve seen other cameras reach out directly to IPs from other countries and you can block out all internet by changing the DNS servers as well)I’m not using this at highest resolution but I did test it some and had no issues. Personally I prefer to run my cameras at 30 frames a second so I’m limiting it to 1080p like my other cameras. The sensor does its best working in dark and light areas as seen in my pictures. I did like they had designed plenty of adjustments where I could dial in how I wanted my exposure to be. For me I wanted the garage exposed the best if could be since I have another camera on the driveway.Long story short if your looking for a decent feature camera that will work with NVRs this is a great camera to use. It’s roughly half the cost of an Amcrest camera with the same resolution and I plan to buy a few of these for my in-laws for their exterior cameras once they move into their house.",,"Test System:• IP Camera: Anpviz Dome model IPC-D250G (2.8mm version)• NVR: Synology DS1618+ running DSM 6.2.1-23824 Update 4 and Synology’s Surveillance Station version 8.2.3-5828• Power: Supplied via single port PoE Injector 48 Volt 15 WattFirst unboxing impressions:• Well packed• Substantial metal base and solid construction• Manual and software included in the box.

I purchased 2 additional Firstrend 1080P cameras to fully cover the outside of my home for $65 each. Firstrend also recommended a Wifi Signal Booster 2.4 Ghz 4W 802.11 Signal Extender for $30.99 to extend the range on the antenna that I was having problems with intermittent signal coverage.The paperwork initially provided was too little and very confusing. I had a few calls with Daisy and she was wonderful, helped greatly, and was very pleasant. Recently, Daisy sent me a newly published User Manual (User Manual Of Firstrend Wireless Camera System-888-806-1588.pdf) which is written in much better English, covered more topics, and solved the overall issue that so many buyers complained about in earlier reviews.The hardware seems to be made really well and sturdy. I had an issue with the antenna connection on one of the cameras and Daisy replaced the camera quickly and the new unit worked great. I read in the original instructions that you needed to tighten the antenna down tight – just don’t tighten it too tightly or you may strip the treads - this may have been partly my fault do to the way the instructions were written.The picture quality is very good in both the day and at night. The power cord on the camera is roughly 9’ in length and depending on placement getting electrical outlets to the cameras can be challenging depending on your experience level. If you use a booster to improve the Wifi signal, the cord on the booster is only a little over 3’ so when I ran electric to for those units I put in a double box with an exterior bubble cover. I also used the same 2-gang weatherproof box when I put 2 cameras in close proximity to each other. Firstrend advises to put cameras at least 5’ from each other.Make sure that the cameras are all connected and working before you install them outside on your house. Adding a camera or two isn’t difficult as long as you have the channels on the NVR to support them. Daisy indicated that the 2 Terabyte hard drive in the NVR that I purchased would record up to 8 Channels/Cameras for 2 weeks automatically and then overwrite the disk starting from the oldest files.Wifi connectivity is absolutely critical. It took me awhile to get workable locations determined on a couple of cameras so that signal issue was consistently strong. What I found was that moving the camera to the end of a gutter or on the other camera to the top of a 7’ fence away from the house itself provided a strong signal without a booster. A good strong signal was obtained on the other camera that would go on and off at times by using the recommended booster.I've attached a few photos that I took during the installation. The TV screen shot shows a typical view while monitoring the cameras and was taken at night while it was raining.Bottom line – I didn’t find it extremely simple to install but if you take your time and do it right it is not a difficult system to install and you will have a first class camera system that will protect you and your home which is what all purchasers are striving for. I strongly recommend this product.","So this is my first security system. When you first start looking for your system, you looking for all the bells and whistles: I want to be able to see all area's of my house, I want to record it, I want to zoom in and talk through it and have them be able to talk back..... Well at least that's what I wanted. I work from home, in the basement and wanted to know what was going outside of my dungeon while I work. Do I really need to get up to check who's at the door? Why is the house quiet, are the kids dead? But what system would work best for me? I have wanted one for years but never followed through because I did not want to run video cords from each camera all the way to the basement, Heeeeell no. So Wireless, yes please! All they need is power plugged into a normal outlet and then they wirelessly send the video to the NVR (DVR) unit where it is being recorded....at my house, no need to be spending money every month to rent some company's cloud somewhere. No monthly fee! But which one? There were at least 5 different brands that I still had on the table at this point. I went with Firstrend in the end because of all the great review about their customer service. And yes you should use email, as yes you are talking to someone across the world, and yes there is a delay of a day or 2.... BUT, It's worth it! Daisy will work with you to make it right! I had a tall order seeing as how my NVR was going to be receiving signals from a basement over a 2,500sq house in the suburbs of Ohio. Some cameras worked great right out of the box. Some cameras worked great sometimes but would lose the signal after a few hours and then I would have to unplug them and plug them back in to make them work again. and 1 camera was just a dud and could not get further than the room I had the NVR in. But, Firstrend Customer Service to the rescue! We tried a few different troubleshooting options, and after those possibilities were removed I was sent 2 wireless boosters to apply to the cameras losing the signal, and a replacement for the camera that was a dud. No forms, no hassle, just what was your amazon order number, what address to send them to, done, express mail, Return anything, naw, don't worry about it! YES! Thank you for making this easy! and in the end I have a working system that I am happy with. I would suggest getting the 4 camera system to try it out and you can always acquire more cameras later. There is Motion Sensing tech on the cameras but I have not found the sweet spot on the sensitivity scale to make it text my phone for kids running with sticks at each other in he driveway but ignore differences in tree shadows, however I think that might be a difficult task for any system. The NVR interface and the App interface are decent, not great, not crap, but I'm happy with it. My next step is to try and share the app to my wife's phone so we both have access, but I know there is some trick to it, as the company is trying to protect you from hackers. But it can be done. I also thought I would like the scheduled recordings for some of the time and then just motion alerts for the rest of the time, but so far I have just stayed with Record everything all the time and no alerts. Sure, it won't protect me from invading clowns spun out on bath salts as they trigger the motion sensor, but better than being texted every 5 mins that the flies/mosquitos are always checking out the camera's built in red light for night vision. Product, I would give 3-4 starts; but man that customer service making it easy for me to make sure everything actually works and no risk? 5 big a$$ stars!","I'm updating this review today Jan 28, 2020:I've had the system installed and working fine since Oct 2018I wrote the review below soon after we got her up and running without problems.Last month we had some sort of power glitch or unprotected power spike (as noted on the recorded time-stamp of video feed.) Both exterior cameras went on the fritz.Since the unit is just a bit outside out of its 12-month warranty and after a short email exchange with the manufacturer’s representative (Neal) requesting a couple of steps to get the two cameras back online, they, Firstrend have been gracious enough to offer sending me two (2) more exterior cameras which we were not able to repair and get back online.My 15-month experience with this product and the help of their rep. Neal still justifies me giving them 5 stars!Their email help is quick and efficient and their out-of-warranty product support is what's to be expected from a successful company!FIRST REVIEW: ""This review is for the n1080P Wireless Security Camera System, Firstrend 8CH Wireless NVR System with 4pcs 1080P Security IP Camera and 2TB Hard Drive Pre-Installed, 65ft Night Vision and Easy Remote Monitoring. Got it set up in about 5 hours (running extra ethernet cable 65 feet to garage and hanging 5 cameras) and the screen views are excellent! Do spend the few extra bucks and get the 1080p system. Motion sensitivity program algorithms need some work though. Too sensitive, even at the lowest settings. Workaround is to record only during motion activation at select periods of time and eliminate the continual recording (if you don't want to overrun old recordings on your drive or if your drive is not big enough or absent and you only want to get notifications either by email or text) You can record both continually and when motion-activated and then separate files into two folders for easier viewing later or you can record either continually only or motion detection only. One big plus is that all cameras record even though only one camera was motion activated. And they only record for 30 seconds after motion activation, not hours, sucking up your hard drive space. This parameter of recoding time is not adjustable. 1080p picture quality of viewing live shots and recorded shots is EXCELLENT, whether it's on your iPhone or your Windows machine!Daisy, in their service group, is wonderful! She was able to resolve the major two hiccups during the set-up, syncing of extra 5th camera (deleting and adding a new ip address of new camera that didn't come with the new 4 camera system, a simple procedure since everything is menu-driven) and why a black and white picture when should be 1080p color (default of system during low light/night conditions in area where camera was surveilling.) The color came back during daylight :)","So far very pleased with this purchase. Had a situation with ""Motion"" setup. Left Email, less than 24hrs later received a response from Daisy.She addressed all my concerns and supplied me with step by step assistance in getting ""Motion"" feature working. Thank you Daisy.It took me time looking at reviews before I decided on this unit. The clarity of video and playback is very good and now with Motion detection working this is a Great system for my security needs.I hope Firstrend continues its A+ customer service if and when needed by anyone.Love the wireless feature (no ""home run"" cabling needed, but could also be used with Ethernet connection) just power outlet to power cameras.Included with this unit is a mouse, short Ethernet router cable, all necessary hardware to mount cameras with a mounting template, covers for non used camera cable ends, drill for mounting, wrench for adjusting cameras and instruction manual.","This is a nice piece of kit. It is easy to set up, including on your phone. There is a wee bit of a learning curve, and I keep learning things about it, but you can get off the ground and operating quickly.Picture quality is quite good, including in the black and white night vision mode.Figuring out how to save the video and some of the powers of the system are a little confusing. Mastering mouse clicks helps, the system likes slow deliberate mouse clicks! Quick clicks frequently don't work.It will stream to a phone, it will send alerts to the phone. You cannot play back video on the phone without the cloud account (has a monthly fee).You can control the alarms for each camera independently (BIG yay!). Haven't fiddled with it, but it appears you can select sensitivity areas visually on each camera as well. This could be hugely helpful for our front camera that sees cars on the road.A helpful accessory/necessity is power extension cords for the DC cord that goes to each camera. This helps you plug in the camera charger inside somewhere and run a small DC power cord out to where the camera is mounted.All in all, we are quite pleased with this system.",1028,497,https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Security-Firstrend-Pre-Installed-Monitoring/dp/B077HX9K3P/ref=sr_1_17_sspa?keywords=ip+security+cameras&qid=1640229951&sr=8-17-spons&psc=1&smid=A20NSOTRW8VH9A&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExSUoyWEJIS0ZPUk1GJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNDA1NTE1M084SzBPWUQ5T1MxWSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDMyMDQwM0paVE00WkxSTEZVViZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to get it up and running as easily as I did.BACKGROUND: I was not eager to get into the expense and complexity of a security system but my wife was convinced that we should have one. We did our homework. The long-term contracts and expense of commercial systems were out. We would need to purchase and install a system ourselves. Wired cameras were eliminated immediately because we don't have access internally and we didn't want wires running on the outside of the house. That left wireless systems. We soon discovered that every brand we looked at required monthly storage fees per camera. All except Lorex. The Lorex system we purchased included a storage device that communicated with our internet and our smartphones via a hard-wired connection to our router and a Lorex app on our phones.INSTALLATION: Everything needed was in the package. (Good!) Instructions were not ""perfect"" but internet searches gave us the missing or incorrect information to enable us to continue. Installation and pairing of the cameras were easy. (Surprise!)USE: Everything works as we expected. There are only two things (so far) that could be improved. 1) There is a time lag between motion sensing and beginning of recording. I don't know if this can be improved. And, 2) night (infrared) picture quality is not as good as full-light picture quality. That's just ""the nature of the beast.""CONCLUSION: The system meets our requirements and our expectations. Can't do much better than that.","As you can see that they are small enough to hide the eaves. These are strictly wireless so that you don't have to cut holes in your home siding. For the cost, these are the best choices.",So far so good the cameras work wireless very far and image quality is excellent,"It would be nice if the batteries lasted longer between charges, but the overall quality is exceptional.",This is a great camera system and it requires no wires!!!,94,7,https://www.amazon.com/Lorex-Wire-Free-Battery-Operated-Deterrence-Detection/dp/B08MVBYV2G/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=lorex+security+camera&qid=1640230174&sr=8-20

Upgraded from Arlo.,Birthmas gift,Easier than we thought to get it up and running!,Good product,"Having used professional grade CCTV systems in the past working in retail and food service, albeit 15-20 years ago, the capabilities of this system blow them out of the water. Yes, I understand that in that time technology has gotten more advanced, which is why for the $269.99 that I paid for this system, I don't believe there is a better product on the market that meets the needs I had.I purchased this system to install in my aging father's home 7,700 miles away from where I am currently stationed in the military. My Dad wanted a system to keep an eye on things around his house due to concerns of vandalism and pranksters. He had purchased a couple Blink XT2 outdoor cameras at Best Buy upon the recommendation of the sales associate, which was $200 wasted... My Dad doesn't even know how to send a text message on his cell phone, but they sold him on cloud based cameras...All-in-all for this system, we spent about $550 (including sales tax and shipping of the items ordered from Amazon). The full system that I pieced together includes the following:- this Lorex 8 channel 1080p system (4 cameras, extension/power cables, DVR with 1TB hard drive, and necessary hardware; everything you need to wire and install 4 cameras and operate the system, assuming you have a tv or monitor to hook it up to)- one Zosi add-on 1080p camera- one Zosi 12v power adapter (although the camera system is 8-channel, the cabling and power adapter included only support 4 channels, so you need to order extra cabling for additional cameras0 not a big deal)- two Postta 150' BNC cable extensions- one Postta 100' BNC cable extension- Toshiba 32"" Smart TV (Fire TV Edition)- one (donated from my stockpile of personal devices) Amazon Echo Dot (2nd generation)I went this route for a few main reasons:(1) Nothing beats having local storage of the recorded video...(2) ...except, also having the ability to access remotely and download video and take screenshots; this system allows both.(3) Hardwired cameras take longer to setup, but alleviate worrying about replacing batteris, no matter how infrequently.(4) Smart home features. This system is compatible with Alexa, Google Home, etc... I have it set up so that I can tell my Echo Show or Fire TV, in my bedroom 7,700 miles away, to show me any one of these cameras in real time. I also have this system setup with a 32"" Toshiba Fire TV being controlled by an Echo Dot at my Dad's house; I'm still working out the kinks with the Fire TV, as it sometimes doesn't display what you want it to, however, my Echo Show does. Additionally, the Lorex Home app for Android and iPhone have given me the flexibility to view real-time footage and system alerts from my cell phone 24/7, from anywhere in the world. Lastly, I just got done setting up the Lorex Cloud program (from 7,700 miles away) on my Windows laptop, which gives me the ability to access the footage another way, as well as make on the fly changes to camera settings, recording, etc.One area where I think Lorex could use some improvement is in their Customer Service Department, however, for the price you are paying, I understand why it is limited- I come to this conclusion based on others' reviews and my one phone call regarding a question I had about using an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) to keep the system online during power outages. I ultimately decided not to use an UPS at this time due to the good reliability of power where my Dad lives. Also regarding Customer Support, it would be nice if Lorex provided a full printed guide with their system, versus the small fold out quick setup guides. I set up the entire system, configured everything, setup Lorex Home on my iPhone, and Lorex Clioud on my laptop, without reading the instructions, but I am also very technologically inclined. I would have preferred the printed users manual for my father, so that he can read it and familiarize himself with the system in his free time. That being said, Lorex has the 114 page manual available on their website, which can be downloaded and printed, so it's really a non-issue, more of just a gripe about convenience.By no means is this an in-depth review. There are so many features of this system that I still need to explore. I spent about an entire day figuring out where to mount the cameras, doing cable runs through the attic of my Dad's house, and getting everything set up, but I also have OCD. You could easily un-package and plug everything in and get it operational, within an hour. All-in-all, I extremely happy with this purchase and the un-matched versatility of this system that gives my Dad peace of mind, and me the ability to keep an eye on things back home from halfway around the world. I would purchase this system again, and will likely purchase other Lorex systems for myself in the future. Anyone who gives this system a bad review is doing something wrong, or is overwhelmed by all of the features and settings that are available; perhaps they need something simpler, like a battery powered stickup camera.","I switched from Arlo to this Lorex 4 camera 1080p system. It is hands down better. Continuous recording, better, programmable motion detection. Very easy to use. I have had no issue with the app or the function of the system. I did have one camera that was not working. Contacted customer service and it was easily setup for replacement with a few serial/model numbers and proof of purchase. I highly recommend.",This is a gift for my husband whose birthday and Christmas are days apart. So it's still wrapped and unopened. But this came in a box with Lorex acrossed it.

If someone else in you authorize to view logs into a second devise it will log you out of the previous devise.",Cameras video in color during the night,"My primary attraction to the Lorex is that it has local storage and that it’s a QHD system that is remotely accessible from inside and outside of the home network. The base station can be connected to the internet via ethernet or wifi, The cameras connect to the base station via a second private wifi network that the unit creates. Once the Lorex Home app is downloaded on your mobile device, and you are signed in. It is a matter of pressing the ‘sync’ button on the back of the base station to put it in pairing mode. Follow a few prompts, and you are done in about 2 minutes.The Lorex app allows you to change the multitude of settings, from motion detection sensitivity to activity zones on the phone. I liked the app allowed you to capture picture and videos as needed while remotely having a conversation with a person via the phone app. I also liked that I could turn off all the lights (status light / LED lights / IR lights) via the app. The app is the central part of the experience and I’ll say the ease in reviewing captured footage as well as scrolling through the timeline is a win for me. The app also lets you see how strong the wifi between the base station and the cameras are for optimal placement.Pros:* Easy to activate, use and live with.* Centralized local storage that is remotely accessible, and remote notification of motion activation* Love the 2-way microphone/talk feature and the loud alarm siren feature that can be remotely activated.* Image quality, image colour rendering, image resolution and wide image field-of-view in “performance” 1080P mode are good enough for surveillance requirements. You can run QHD should you need a higher resolution but you need to plug it in.* Amazing and highly functional Lorex Home app for controlling and viewing your cameras*dual band wifi capable*no subscription necessaryCons:* Motion detection does not work when facing a wall or shooting through glass* The wall mount is horrible. One can quickly remove the camera by just tugging on the camera. If you mount it accessible outside, people can steal it, if you mount it discrete it would be hard to get to it for recharging the batteries.","Very affordable alternative to the major player in the all-inclusive home surveillance game, the Lorex HomeHub 3 camera surveillance system is easy to setup and use. It took me less than ten minutes to get everything setup and connected, with all cameras up and running around my home. The 2k resolution makes it much easier to see details like license plates or identifying characteristics like uniform logos or faces. The HomeHub sends alerts whenever any of the triggers I have enabled are set off. I especially like the built in 32 gigabyte storage which gives me peace of mind that in case something happens while I'm away I will have a recording of it. Very affordable, effective, and most importantly - easy to use home surveillance system.","I have wireless cameras that do not use a hub and use its own SD card. I like that, but I also like this set. There are several useful options. One thing that's nice and not all cameras have without a paid subscription is, this set lets you have detection zones for each camera.

I wanted a new system with the BNC connections since I have had this type of camera cables ran for years and didn't want to change it out. I needed eight cameras with at least 1080P resolution and ease of remote phone viewing. I find this system the easiest set up of anything I've previously had. I didn't have to port forward or try numerous router attempts to get addresses and ports set up. To get remote viewing after the Lorex set up all I had to do was to accept access on first attempt through AT&T Smart Home Manager App. That's it!The whole system is impressive from local screen adjustments and control to remote software viewing and control. Although it does not come with a manual one can be downloaded from the Lorex site but I find the quick set up guides easy and software pretty user friendly. The camera view is a pretty wide angle. I find the detail pretty amazing for a 1080P. I love the zoom ability on home monitor and phone. I was worried about only one HDMI output for monitor since I wanted the view on two others simultaneously but I solved that with a splitter HDMI cable and a HDMI to RCA converter running RCAs to two other monitors in other rooms. The system comes with a mouse and everything needed except a monitor. The 1TB hard drive is plenty big enough for me recording continuously because in all these years I never ever needed to go back more than a day or so and certainly not a couple of weeks or more to see an event. The night vision LEDs are a lot brighter on the cameras than previous night vision cameras I've had making it ""SEE"" farther at night than I ever have been able to do with my other systems. The night view is bright and lots of detail. It's a set and forget system without battery changes, no cloud expense, no professional router expertise needed for simple phone view, and very easy to use with tons of features. I love this system and highly recommend it for a complete system(-monitor) for the price point.",,,,,24,1,https://www.amazon.com/8-Channel-Security-System-Weatherproof-Cameras/dp/B07G2PSRCS/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=lorex+security+camera&qid=1640230174&sr=8-13

I am an engineer in the live video industry for medical devices (surgical video) and I am SO impressed by the video quality of this Lorex system! I decided to go analog as I had been using a Panasonic digital IP (ethernet and WiFi webcam, circa 2010-ish?) system for years and wanted to go with something with one-way uninterrupted video streaming, higher-resolution and better sensitivity without having to rely on two-way digital handshaking to work due to the history of the Panasonic digital system often locking-up or odd hanging delays or whatever...This system blasts continuous video to the DVR, default the DVR just records everything coming in and you won't get much record time if you leave it like that even with a 2T hard drive. I configured my setup to only record when motion is detected and now I get over a month of recorded video for all channels, nice!As for the color night vision: YES IT HAS COLOR NIGHT VISION if even the tiniest ambient light is available as indicated by Lorex. For example, the camera on the side of my house is ALWAYS in color mode (24hrs a day) because of a street light out on the street that's not very bright but provides enough light to keep the camera in color mode. In total or near-total darkness the camera turns on it's own infrared (IR) LED illuminator and also switches over to a B&W image which has incredible resolution, dynamic range and signal to noise ratio (S/N) given the tiny size of the single IR LED on the camera. Reviewers who are complaining that this system does not have color night vision did not read the spec carefully or do not understand video and illumination basics.One con though: I wish the system had microphones on the cameras and was able to record audio along with the video.In summary if you don't mind running wires then this system is amazing not even taking the price into consideration, believe me I spent A LOT more on the Panasonic IP system 10-yrs ago and am getting much better performance from this new analog system which is not a surprise I guess because of updates to video sensor capabilities in recent years (mobile phone industry driven).BIG thumbs-up from me!",Bought this as an upgrade to my old system that I had for 4years. Definitely an improvement on camera quality day and night.

Lorex must have done something to improve this model camera because it does a lot better than the older one (which was excellent in it' day). The night vision on this is so much better than the older one that the picture on my monitor looks like it is day time when actually I took this picture of my monitor at 1 a.m. with the outside porch light turned off. The new camera is number 4 on the picture of the monitor and the others are the original 5 year old cameras. This camera makes such a good difference that after I write this review I am going to order the 4 pack of this camera and replace all of my cameras.,This is an add on for our existing lorex security system. These cameras are superior to the 4 that came with the original system as the mounting bracket has improved to allow more flexibility in positioning the camera. Night vision is okay but could be better. All in all this was a good buy and we will be adding one more camera in the future.,I have the older LBV2531S-C models and they work well but optics and clarity did leave something to desire. I ordered the newer model LBV2531U-C and am really pleased. Night vision is far better and clarity is absolutely great. Able to expand pictures and still have great definition and recognition capability. Will be replacing all my older models with this newer model as time and money become available.,These cameras are great and just what we needed to connect to our existing Loren DVR,This camera 1080P works great with the Lorex 6 camera 4K system I got at Costco.

Hooked everything up, had to call their customer service group a few times for clarification on a couple of questions. Got great service, polite, helpful, professional. Highly recommend this system (the latest version) to anyone looking for a self-installed home system.","Guessing that a lot of these purchases are event driven and mine certainly is. We have a cabin and a barn on a 6 acre piece of property. The barn is where we park the tractor and store the supporting tools and supplies. The barn was recently broken into and everything of value was taken. While that is deeply disheartening, it really only affects me. If the cabin were to be robbed and ransacked like the barn was, I have several young children that would likely never want to go/stay there again.I do consider myself handy when it comes to mechanical and electronic projects. I also believe that I am a good researcher and analyst. I found that there are a lot of great alarm systems available at very affordable prices today including DIY professional systems. Several of the professional systems now have videos on installation and configuration—configuration used to be the tough part of installing one of those.In my case, I was looking for a balance of price, ease installation and options for monitoring. Given the recent break-in, I also wanted to get this project started and completed quickly as the cabin is just as vulnerable as the barn.This next statement may make you question my research, or at least, reading abilities. While I did plan to have the system monitored, I didn’t realize until after I purchased my SimpliSafe system that you can’t monitor the system remotely at all with the app without one of the SimpliSafe plans, and, at the time of this writing, March, 2021, you have to have the $25/mo. plan to do any serious monitoring. I would have putt off having the system monitored for a while if that were not the case. Perhaps it is better that I was forced into a plan earlier than I wanted. As an aside, SimpliSafe gives you 3 days of ‘practice’ use after you activate your system. This means they won’t contact local law enforcement if the system detects and alarm. On the one hand I wanted my system monitoring to start immediately but, do understand the logic of giving me time to learn to use the system without causing false alarms.The installation was truly easy. Once you plug in the basestation and pull the battery tab on the keypad, you are off to a great start. Installing any of the sensors is as easy as removing a paper battery tab, using the keypad to tell the basestation that you are installing a new device and naming it from a list once the basestation announces that a new device has been detected. The preinstalled double sided tape makes mounting the sensors easy. Our cabin has numerous unfinished roughhewn wood surfaces and I decided to mount sensors that had to be on those surfaces with the included screws. I didn’t try the included self-adhesive on the roughhewn wood which, may have worked perfectly.SimpliSafe tells you how far away you can mount sensors like the glass break and motion sensors but it was less clear about how high to mount them given the space I was working in or, for the glass break in particular, the angular range that it could work with. For example, if you have windows on opposite sides of a room with no option to mount the sensor in the middle, can it detect glass breaking behind it or beside it?SimpliSafe sensors are relatively inexpensive, and, as such, perhaps an extra sensor or two isn’t a bad thing.The App is easy to set up and use and definitely slanted to the easy side rather than the comprehensive side. That said, if a sensor were to drop off the app will alert you to that. I am not looking forward to changing batteries but would rather that to running wires through an older structure.SimpliSafe has done a great job making system purchase, installation and operation easy and straightforward. They even sent me an e-mail letting me know that the county where my cabin is located requires a form and payment to be completed and sent to authorize monitoring and, more specifically, response. Not only did they tell me about it, they sent me the exact link to the form. They also let me know that no paperwork or fee was required for the fire monitor.The cabin can be a relatively harsh environment with high humidity in the summer and relatively cold nights. I am hoping the sensors, base station and keypad are rugged enough to function for years to come.If you are looking at one of these systems, read all you can to understand what you can and can’t do with and without SimpliSafe’s monitoring options. Watch or read about sensor placement and plan your own install. I don’t think you have to become an alarm expert but each install has its own challenges. I found plenty of good information available from a lot of sources on the Internet to address those challenges. I have not interacted with SimpliSafe’s customer service at this point and can’t comment on that aspect of the product.Overall, I believe I made a good decision for my family and have only positive things to say about the installation and operation of my SimpliSafe system.",,Excellent security system! Easy to install .The best thing is the ability to monitor system with the phone app and receive text and email alerts and ability to arm/disarm.Customer service is the best with virtually no wait and talented reps.

I asked what she used to get these and she showed me the Wyze v2. So I jumped on line and search out her camera. I came across the v3. I did more digging to see what the difference were and the first was size. I was able to use the magnetic mount and mount it to my fish tank rack. It looks like from a distant something for my tank. It is just over 25 feet from the camera to the front door. I watch a few YT videos and it out performs the v2 and it have color night vision. I have not test this out yet, but is a dimly lit room you can see in color and clearly.

Meanwhile, during the night, someone came into our very well lit parking lot and cut out my catalytic converter!!! Just mine (apparently Honda Elements are targets..who knew?) Anyway, I was so upset. It cost me almost $2000 to get it fixed. So I decided if the board won't get cameras...I WILL. So I bought this and it has been the BEST THING EVER! I just prop it in my window (which has a screen that cannot be removed) and it's perfect. I can have it right up against the screen and still see everything or close the window and it will still be fine through the window AND screen! I have it aimed at the parking lot. I can see the entire condo complex with this thing! Amazing! I can see everything at night!

The set up of the mini was FAR EASIER than the outside cams. I had this thing set up in less than 5 minutes. Picture is good. Sound is LOUD which is what I was looking for.The app however needs some work to support this style of camera. The app works decently for the BlinkXT cameras and functionality, which is motion for most users. As in you get a notification that there is motion, it records, and you watch the recording or live as you please. but it is clunky to get into the Blink Mini for the purpose of continuous viewing which is my intention for this camera, like a baby monitor. Like many other Americans now working from home with a full house of kids, I wanted to use this to assist with keeping an eye on the kids as I worked and record those cute moments. I wanted to use this to visualize a blind spot that I can’t see from the office. I tried mounting it from the ceiling and realized you can’t rotate the video. Mounting on the wall was a little problematic, I couldn’t quite get the right angle needed.Another quirk to the app is if you switch to another app and then come back to the Blink app, you have to hit the play button to resume viewing.All in all, these are minor issues specific to my use of the camera which is why I have it five stars anyway.Hey amazon/Blink, it would be an awesome feature if you’d allow the integration of this camera with Alexa so we can “drop in” and talk through the Echo Dot. Just saying.",I love this lil camera!! Easy to install! Only took 5 min and it works great!! Highly recommend this!!,Great price and product. Connected very easily to my existing Blink system. I am not happy with having to pay for storage after trial ends.,"This is a great little camera monitor. Pros: easy set up, easily managed with your smart phone, clear image quality with motion detection. Can be set up to arm and record at any time. I bought this to use in my master bedroom by my desk where I keep sensitive information.Cons: if you are using it with another Blink product and you arm 24/7 then the other Blink unit also needs to be armed which is an issue because my other unit uses 2 AA batteries. There is no timer on the app to set up a time to arm which would by useful because I sometimes forget to arm at night. It has good night vision quality. It needs to be plugged in so is a problem if you put it in a place (i.e. bedroom closet) if there is no outlet. Because of this, it is difficult to make the camera more hidden (if you are looking for a nanny camera for example).Overall it is easy to use and I would recommend it for a basic home security camera.","SO...I rarely write reviews but was so amazed by this camera I wanted to let others know. I bought the camera after using the Ring indoor camera for twice the price and it made a constant clicking noise with the filter adjustment to light in the room that was a known issue Ring told me and not a defect. I've tried all the other brands out there WYZE, etc and disappointed with all. Then I tried the Blink Mini which I thought was a good price. The setup was a breeze, up and running in 30 seconds. The app is responsive and user friendly. My wifi is sloooow but it still loaded a 1080p HD quality view w hen I accessed it from my mobile app. My favorite feature is the night vision.

It works great, and I love it. Still, I would suggest a few improvement just in case the Ring dev team happens to read this:1) I'm assuming that Ring Protect Plus is using AWS cloud services. If that's the case, your orchestrator needs work. Sometimes, I'm only able to access a very limited number of saved motion alerts. The problem clears up later which makes me think that you're spinning up storage to meet demand....and it's slow. I could be wrong, and the microservices might be glitching but it feels like a scalability issue.2) I'd like to be able to set different alerts for different motion zones. I want to capture every car that goes down my street (for aforementioned car thieves) and then capture people in my driveway. If this is already possible, I haven't figured out how to make it work yet.Those 2 little things aside, this is a solid product and I hope it stands the test of time and weather because it's already captured pictures of 2 cars involved in break-ins in my neighborhood.",The 2021 Ring Floodlight Security Camera is an excellent product. The phone App is smart and intuitive. The camera captures movement and sound day and night. Camera includes speaker for sound and Mic for communication. Use the phone App to communicate. View the videos using the Phone App. The Security Camera is hard wired for power and uses WIFI for internet. This Security Camera has many features.

They last through snow, wind, rain, and sun. They have amazing low light vision. Clear pictures. And a great setup to last two years on double AAs. And for those who need them to last longer buy the adapter to plug them in. It's stupid how these people come and review these as if they were 5000 dollar security set ups. These are worth it and a great value.",,"We are happy with our blink indoor cameras. It being wireless, light, and battery powered made it easy to install. The motion detection feature allows you to choose sections of the room you want monitored. The night vision is provides good quality captures and we were surprised the battery life is rated for two years. However, please keep in mind that it could change base on how much you use the live view, how often it triggers to record, how long the duration of recording, is set to, and if your wifi signaling is bad.Note: if you have a large area or areas with lots of obstructions (i.e. cement, brick, steel, and aluminum) walls you may want to have a wifi meshed network to extend you wifi network pass these obstructions. We have the Google Nest Wifi system. Also, the blink camera must connect to the sync module via low frequency radio (LFR). Because of this, the camera must be within distance of the sync module. This is separate from your home wifi network. My suggestion is to get another syn-module if you run into issues where your single sync-module cannot cover all camera areas.","The all-new Blink Indoor – wireless, HD security camera appears to be a good product at a reasonable price. I bought a set of three that came with a Sync module. I believe up to 10 devices can be connected wirelessly to the Sync module that communicates using your home wifi. I was able to easily set up the camera using the Blink app on an iPhone. in addition, I was able to link to Alexa using my Amazon Prime account. This helped to view the camera on the Echo View screen using Alexa voice command such as, ""Alexa, show Living Room.""I understand that Lithium AA batteries (supplied with the camera) would last for two years.

I have had CCTV cameras in my house for years. I've been using Swann wired cameras for the most part with mixed emotions. But running new wires to upgrade the system just didn't excite me.I had been looking at NEST cams since I have the smart Thermostats and Smoke/Carbon-monoxide detectors for a while, but the price is ridiculous! Plus your only option with them is cloud service (an additional cost). Then I spoke with a neighbor who sent me a screen shot from his YI camera. I must say, the quality was pretty impressive.So I bought a four pack for $119.00 with moderate expectations. Let me tell you I'm super impressed with the picture quality of these cameras. Set up is quick and easy. When I purchased them I had no idea they had audio as well. The audio quality is incredible, plus it's a two way speaker. Purchased 32 GB SD cards for all of them so I didn't need to use cloud storage and it's been working great! I have them set to record all motion and I usually have about 7 days of history on each camera.Day and night vision are both spectacular IMO. I have attached several photos so you can see the quality both day and night. Side note, I have a couple ""indoor cams"" mounted outside. To do this I purchased a rubber sleeve/cover from Amazon to make the drop cam weather resistant for outdoor application. It's been through rain, sleet and snow with out issue so far. Link to cover: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FD5XHMP/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1A couple cons, the power cable is sooooooo short. I had to purchased longer cables for a couple of my installs. No biggie, they are only a few dollars here on Amazon. The app for iOS is very functional, but it has no multi camera view which would be a nice option.","So I have been using the Yi 1080p indoor camera system for 2 weeks now and I LOVE IT! The camera's are crystal clear during the day and are just as sharp in night mode. The added features of being able to hide any ""lights"" such as the blue power light and the typical red IR lights for night vision makes ""hiding"" these cameras a breeze. The playback function works great and give you the time in hours, minutes & seconds. The 2 way talk feature works great and has 2 modes, 1 is a push to talk feature where when you press the button you cannot hear what the person on the camera is saying and the 2nd is a continuous talk where you and the person on the camera can talk back and forth without pressing any buttons (love this feature) the 32gig on board storage is also a great bonus. Like I said I have been using the cameras for about 2 weeks and have barely used 3 gigs of space. (for an idea of the amount of traffic, it's just me, my wife and our 2 pets) so the cameras don't get a ton of action during the week. But are always recording on any motion. (I do not subscribe to the cloud storage as for I haven't seen a need) Anytime you get an alert it will store it on the app and you can upload it to your mobile device and share it with others. The initial motion detection clip is only 6 seconds, but if you wait till the end of the 6 seconds you will get an option to ""view entire motion"" which will bring up that camera, rewind to when it first detected the motion and play it back until there is no longer any motion, GREAT feature. All of the features seem to work as expected, you can set times for your camera to alert you when it detects motion and zones so that your dog walking around doesn't keep triggering the alerts. I can say the motion detection is VERY sensitive. You can set the setting to low, medium or high but really I can't tell a difference low to high. I have one camera facing out of my front window and it picks up shadows, car lights, leaves blowing, etc. Not a big deal, but on a windy day I can get a ton of alerts. The app works great, you can set a PIN or use your fingerprint to log into the cameras so in the event your phone is stolen, unless they have your PIN or fingerprint they will not be able to pull up your cameras. Connecting them was very simple and took less than 5 minutes per camera. Plug them in, scan the UR code and they will automatically connect to the network your phone is connected to. The packaging was very nice, didn't feel cheap. All cameras were individually wrapped along with all of the accessories. Comes with instruction booklet for assistance with installing/setup. The camera (black part) can be removed from the white base and mounted in different areas. They also sell (separately) wall mounts for the cameras. (cheap, like $10-$15 for a 4 pack) or you can stand them up anywhere you like (they have a round rubber grip on the bottom to help keep them from sliding around. All 4 cameras come with a USB cord and power brick. The USB cord is about 10-12 feet long so you should be able to place these cameras wherever you'd like. OK so I hope this rant...I mean review was helpful. If you're anything like me, I read all the reviews on a product before I make a purchase. Thanks for reading!***(I am not affiliated with Yi or any of there products, this was simple a consumer review, please purchase these at your own risk)***","I purchased the Yi 4 pk. 1080 Indoor security cameras. I was skeptical but am so glad I took the chance. I placed them in various windows facing outside as it’s outside I want to observe. They work perfectly during the day and, where the outside area is lit, at night. If the area is not lit, there is a reflection on the glass from the IR light, but they ARE designed to be indoor cameras. They work very well indoors, day and night, as intended. I have observed some sketchy people that have rung my doorbell when I’m not home (I have a camera in the window next to door), along with the neighbor’s cat, a family of raccoons, an opossum and numerous squirrels. I had an issue where they stopped alerting me of activity (which I see some others have had, also) and contacted Yi customer service. They promptly replied to my request and worked with me to make sure all my phone settings were correct. Turned out, the problem was with my phone settings, battery saver shutting down the app, NOT with the cameras or their app. I especially love that I can insert my own sd cards to save & view past events and not have to pay for ‘cloud’ subscription. I don’t know of another security camera that offers this. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase! In fact, I ordered another set of 4. If you are still in doubt, look up some reviews and comparisons of the Yi cameras on youtube.",,"Best Security Option for a home because:1. Its a one time charge- no monthly subscription- and all of the features of the camera work with the SD card2. The camera video is excellent especially the Night vision- it can see in almost complete darkness- wow3.

I use this feature so the cars that pass outside of my house do not trigger the alert only the area literally right in front of my door.4. The intercom is clear and at the appropriate volume5. Install and app use is seriously easy whether your a ""techy"" or not6. Small form and can be hidden without drawing attention7. Excellent price - for what you get its so worth it!8.

Easy To Install And Simple To Use. Quality Product!,Huge Upgrade for Arlo,"Quality Product, Easy to Install and Operate",,"I was in the market for an outdoor security camera and debated between the Nest Outdoor Camera and the Canary Flex. I decided to go with the Nest being that it had better and more reviews than the Canary. I received the camera on a Friday afternoon and installed it the following morning about 10:30am. Within 24 hours we captured video of a man searching our vehicles. The vehicles were locked and nothing valuable was in them. The suspect came Sunday morning at 5:45am. The Nest app sent me the notification stating that it detected activity, but I never heard my phone. When I woke up, I sent the video and a still shot of the suspect to my neighbor who happens to be captain of our local police department. It's now Wednesday and they already have him identified. I was kind of hesitant about spending $180 for a camera, but it has already paid for itself. Overall, this is a great product and I have already recommended it to many locals in our neighborhood. I'm already trying to decide where I want to install my next camera.",,"The Nest Cam Outdoor was an upgrade from my three year old Arlo, and in a big way. The quality of the video, and the speed at which I could pull up a live view isn't even close to being comparable. The added bonus is the speed and accuracy that Nest Aware is able to see motion, identify it as a person, or other moving object, and then pop up the notification on my Apple Watch! It was easy to set up. Super happy with this camera.","My home faces onto a cul-de-sac, and I had previously installed a dusk-to-dawn light on the front wall of my garage. As added security (and for something fun to play with), I purchased this Nest Outdoor Cam.The installation was completed today, and I am quite impressed with the quality of the product and the ease with which the camera was activated and integrated into my smart home environment.The physical installation was a bit challenging, as I am very much a senior citizen and it is SUMMER (90+ degrees) in Gulf Coast Florida. Some years ago, installation of the dusk-to-dawn light required both a junction box and a corresponding hole through the soffit into my attic. With some difficulty, I enlarged the soffit hole, and with greater difficulty maneuvered the camera wiring through the junction box, through the soffit, and into the attic (warm up there!), where I connected the power cord.Worked like a charm! The camera is at least 40' from my router, being separated by interior and outdoor walls, but connectivity has been rock solid. Alexa lives everywhere in my home, including garage and bathrooms, and Nest Hubs of various types are also well-represented. Using the Google Nest Skill, all these gadgets were soon happily co-existing with my new camera.Pix include:1) garage, showing Nest Outdoor Camera above pre-existing dawn-to-dusk security light2) same, close-up3) detail of connection through soffit4) screenshot from my PC: daytime camera view5) screenshot from my PC: nighttime camera view (dawn-to-dusk light is on)I have yet to experiment with all the various settings, but simply using the camera defaults has provided very satisfactory results, including notifications via both push and email.

Good night vision,"This IMOU camera has very good coverage with pan-tilt control in the smartphone. I cannot hear any noise when doing the pan-tilt movement. One surprise is that this camera has one privacy cover that can be controlled via smartphone. Another advantage is the super low video latency (almost less than 1/4 second). The sound latency is normal around 1s.I always want to have one camera with pan-tilt control that can cover the whole room without using multiple cameras. I purchased one Samsung SMARTCAM A1 (only can pan the camera up to 350° not tilt) before, however, the software is very hard to use and cost me more than $200. I also checked other famous brands like Ring and Arlo, but they just do not have any camera that supports pan-tilt control. Mi has one pan-tilt control camera, but I have some problems with the night vision of other Mi cameras. There is a clear ""click"" sound when the night vision is switched on. When the room has some light and not full dark, the camera's night vision will switch on and off frequently and causing lots of ""click"" sound. So far, I did not notice the ""click"" sound problem in this IMOU camera. I did experience one connection error in the initial setup, but I retried again and it works smoothly. I think the initial connection problem is caused by the permission issues in the iPhone. The IMOU camera can automatically connect to the device's wifi without letting you go to the Setting and manually switch wifi. This feature requires the permission in iOS to allow the device to access the local network, after I accepted this permission, the connection is very smooth.","What a value for the money. Delivers on everything it advertises and more. The picture quality for both day and night settings is great. The app is packed with features and easy to use. I will be ordering more.I had settled on this/these camera rather than a full ip camera (NVR) system due to the major price difference. I was willing to sacrifice the ip streaming and local recording in order for ease of setup and to save a few bucks. I was poking around in the settings and come to realize this camera supports RTSP (realtime streaming protocol) which allows setup with most security camera software. I am impressed by this capability in such an affordable camera.My only gripe (and it is a small one) is that the motors that move the camera were virtually silent when I received the cameras, however now that I have had them mounted (inverted/upsidedown) for several days, you can hear every time the camera tracks motion. I am not sure if this is a result of me mounting the cameras upside-down or not, however I assumed this was alright to do since the settings give you the option to invert the output stream. Clearly this was not big enough of a deal for me to take away a star on the rating.","I love this camera. I got it because I have a lot of house deliveries and they come inside the house. Where I have the camera it catches the front door, back door, and my windows. I can see everything on my phone. It even accommodates my two cats.","Set up was a bit dicey but once I figured it out, what a great camera. I can share with my family and even talk to them. Exceeds what I wanted from this device. Excellent choice!",I like it but I'm just no happy that I have to use another app to open it.

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.Innovative, Quality, AffordableHow did you come up with the idea for this product? Night Owl originated from a desire to provide customers with an easy to use, cost effective and high quality product. We believe that everyone should be able to secure what matters most to them. Whether for your home or business, Night Owl offers state-of-the-art technology that will help give you peace of mind, all the time. What makes your product special?Night Owl’s Smart Detection Security System uses dual sensors to eliminate the number of false alarms you receive by up to 90%. Whereas standard security systems using current motion detection technology send out alerts every time motion is sensed, our heightened detection system is designed to focus in on objects that present more of a threat. Gone are the days of receiving an alarm when a bug flies in front of the camera, a cobweb appears, the wind strongly blows or heavy rain looms. Instead, enjoy the peace of mind that accompanies fewer motion alerts as Night Owl helps you protect what matters most. While our systems are set to motion record by default, we do offer multiple recording options as we understand the needs of our consumers are varied. As such, you may elect to set your cameras to 24/7 record or scheduled record should this be a necessity for your home or business. Keep in mind, setting your system to motion record with our Dual Sensor Technology will drastically increase the life of your hard drive and make locating important recordings much easier! What has been the best part of your startup experience?The most rewarding aspect of our company is being able to provide our customers with the security they deserve. Our Dual Sensor Technology helps ensure that customers are alerted to actual threats or meaningful events. Prior to this advancement, standard security systems would send alerts to your Smart Device anytime a camera detected motion. While this was of huge benefit to our consumers, some articulated that they were receiving too many false alerts. Night Owl listened! Our Dual Sensor Technology truly takes it to the next level! By incorporating infrared sensors into the 1080p cameras, this system utilizes both motion detection and heat detection to minimize false alerts and keep you apprised of Real threats in Real time.","{'Product Dimensions': '6.98 x 2.4 x 3.4 inches', 'Item Weight': '14.4 ounces', 'ASIN': 'B01LEXRD7E', 'Item model number': 'CAM-PIRHDA10W-BU', 'Customer Reviews': '', 'Best Sellers Rank': '', 'Is Discontinued By Manufacturer': 'No', 'Date First Available': '2016-09-02', 'Manufacturer': 'Night Owl Security'}",",,1080p Indoor/Outdoor Wired Infrared Camera.

I don't know why some people say that it only records with motion. If they read or have some type of knowledge,you can change the settings to record all the time..also you can view it on all devices live and recorded... the best easy to use systems...",This camera security system is amazing and the video is so clear and the clarity is beyond amazing. The HD quality of the pictures that you get from the cameras are unbelievable you can pick up somebody's license plates and their faces. The lens surface may look small but the amount of space in panoramic view you get is large. To hook it up to your smartphone is super easy. The only problem I have encountered is trying to hook it up to my computer. Night Owl has been great with trying to help me work on this. Other than that this camera system is beyond amazing and the clarity of the pictures and quality of the video you will get is astonishing. The audio is amazing on the two audio cameras that you get with the set you can clearly hear if someone makes a comment or say something. If you're looking to update your security camera system I would definitely recommend you buy this camera security system.,"I had this camera system professional installed, all around, and inside of my home. I use 2 cams indoor, and 6 outdoor. The outdoor cameras are very durable (I live in Michigan where the weather varies from very hot, to extremely cold; plus severe storms are the norm)! I haven't had any trouble seeing what's going on outdoors, or inside, when I'm home watching on the big monitor (not included), or away on my tablet of cellphones (I use both iPhone and Galaxy S android phones). I really don't have any complaints, and have been very happy with the equipment. The management interface is a little dated, but it's just a camera system, so it's very functional and easy to use. The on-device playback system has improved over the past year, with firmware updates, and is straightforward to use! The mobile app playback is still a little clunky, but I'm hopeful it will improve once they update the apps. Anyway, I highly recommend this camera system, and will buy it again, whenever I move!","I had a first gen Night Owl system that quit working after 5 years so I decided to upgrade to a HD system. I have to say I am impressed with the system in whole. It was easy to set up and the streaming to smartphone worked easily and extremely well once port forwarding was set up. The app is very intuitive allowing for capture of snapshot or video file. The cameras are awesome and correlate movement with IR and display events as a yellow block on a timeline for easy review. the video quality is really sharp and the night vision mode really reaches out so much better than the older 720p cameras I had. The documentation is spotty at best and It took awhile to learn how to search and find events, but once figured it out it's really cool and easy to find things that set the system to record or send an alarm. I am very happy with the system, will see how it holds up.",Great system. But each camera needs WiFi. So with 10 cameras 4 smart TVs 5cable boxes 2 smart phones fire stick and an I pad all on one WiFi with upgraded 150 speed it’s picture is delayed or pauses a bit.

The set up of the mini was FAR EASIER than the outside cams. I had this thing set up in less than 5 minutes. Picture is good. Sound is LOUD which is what I was looking for.The app however needs some work to support this style of camera. The app works decently for the BlinkXT cameras and functionality, which is motion for most users. As in you get a notification that there is motion, it records, and you watch the recording or live as you please. but it is clunky to get into the Blink Mini for the purpose of continuous viewing which is my intention for this camera, like a baby monitor. Like many other Americans now working from home with a full house of kids, I wanted to use this to assist with keeping an eye on the kids as I worked and record those cute moments. I wanted to use this to visualize a blind spot that I can’t see from the office. I tried mounting it from the ceiling and realized you can’t rotate the video. Mounting on the wall was a little problematic, I couldn’t quite get the right angle needed.Another quirk to the app is if you switch to another app and then come back to the Blink app, you have to hit the play button to resume viewing.All in all, these are minor issues specific to my use of the camera which is why I have it five stars anyway.Hey amazon/Blink, it would be an awesome feature if you’d allow the integration of this camera with Alexa so we can “drop in” and talk through the Echo Dot. Just saying.",I love this lil camera!! Easy to install! Only took 5 min and it works great!! Highly recommend this!!,Great price and product. Connected very easily to my existing Blink system. I am not happy with having to pay for storage after trial ends.,"This is a great little camera monitor. Pros: easy set up, easily managed with your smart phone, clear image quality with motion detection. Can be set up to arm and record at any time. I bought this to use in my master bedroom by my desk where I keep sensitive information.Cons: if you are using it with another Blink product and you arm 24/7 then the other Blink unit also needs to be armed which is an issue because my other unit uses 2 AA batteries. There is no timer on the app to set up a time to arm which would by useful because I sometimes forget to arm at night. It has good night vision quality. It needs to be plugged in so is a problem if you put it in a place (i.e. bedroom closet) if there is no outlet. Because of this, it is difficult to make the camera more hidden (if you are looking for a nanny camera for example).Overall it is easy to use and I would recommend it for a basic home security camera.","SO...I rarely write reviews but was so amazed by this camera I wanted to let others know. I bought the camera after using the Ring indoor camera for twice the price and it made a constant clicking noise with the filter adjustment to light in the room that was a known issue Ring told me and not a defect. I've tried all the other brands out there WYZE, etc and disappointed with all. Then I tried the Blink Mini which I thought was a good price. The setup was a breeze, up and running in 30 seconds.

So easy to set up!,Powerful but inexpensive and easy to use security camera,Simple to setup,Easiest Camera I have bought.,Best Security Camera You Can Buy at This Price Point!,WOW! I have 3 other Amcrest camera at this house - all indoor cameras. I wanted this one on the front porch. This one is by far the easiest to set up. It was all done and finished in less than about 30 minutes. It is raining today so I’ll wait until tomorrow to screw it into the side of the house. The picture quality is perfect. We don’t have a porch light so I love the fact that I can set it on so the light comes on when it detects motion. I can turn that on and off easily. I can also share limited access with up to 6 people but I’ll only be sharing it with my husband. My only complaint is that I wish it was available in black since we live in a rural area so white sort of stands out like a sore thumb. We have a log house so white doesn’t cut it. I might have to paint it black! Maybe they will make them black as an option. I also love the 9’ cord but also the black option would be nice. LOVE IT!,"After purchasing this camera and using for a few weeks here are my feelingsPictureGreat wide viewing angle. Allows me to see a wide area of property. The night vision function works well and can view a decent distance. The SD picture looks good but when switching to the HD view you get a lot of detail. (See pics included in review)Spotlight/sirenThis camera comes with an LED floodlight. This light can be toggled on and off easily on the app or be set to activate on motion. The light is surprisingly bright and lights up the immediate area. Also the light can be set to strobe with can bring a lot of attention to the area. The siren also can be activated by motion or button on app. It’s pretty loud and anyone in the area will be alerted.Listen/talkThe camera picks up the outside noise and sounds clearly. You can easily hear a conversation in the immediate area. The talk function works well. Anyone in the area will hear you.AppThe AmcrestSmartHome app is clean and easy to use. Layout is intuitive and buttons are responsive. Set up of the camera though this app is easy and fast. I had the camera up, running and viewable in minutes. You control all the camera functions here (listen/talk/light/siren/record... etc)Record functionThis works really well and I like the way you control from the app. I did not use the cloud record function but instead use the SD card. You can easily find review recorded footage and sound from the app. It also lets you quickly save pictures and video to device.Motion optionsAlso this works well. Easy to set up and responsive through the app. Areas set activate with what you program without issue.In conclusionI am very happy with my purchase. The camera is inexpensive and easy to use but offers powerful features. I plan on ordering more for my property.","This little camera puts out decent light when motion is detected. The alarm (siren) isn't the loudest alarm there is, but its annoying enough to let you know something was caught by the camera. The Wi-Fi setup is easy to use. The camera uses a usb plug for power so you can always get an extension to get more length out of the power wire. The quality of the picture is pretty good too. Once the spotlight comes on from motion, the quality of the picture improves because of the light. I ended up disabling the alarm portion (which is easy to do in app) and put the camera on my shed in the backyard. When I go outside towards the shed the light turns on automatically to light the way - super convenient. There is a separate app from Amcrest to setup this camera - Amcrest Smart Home. At first I was annoyed that I had to use a separate app to view and control the camera (I have a couple IP cameras on an NVR). However, once the camera is configured, you can easily add it to your NVR and use one app (in my case its the Amcrest View Pro app.","This camera is as simple as it gets. The app makes it super easy to set up and I was done setting it up in less than a minute. It was easy to navigate the settings and make it do exactly what I wanted it to do. The mounting bracket is tough and super simple. I have this mounted on my front porch and have the motion setting set to only go off if someone is on the sidewalk coming up to the house. It is actually a super good picture for being a 1080P camera. The audio is super clear even when someone is talking quietly. The wind was blowing, and it was able to cut some of that out and make the audio useable. The light is super bright and comes on fast after it detects motion. The siren isn’t super loud, but I don’t have any intention of using it anyway, so it didn’t bother me. Overall, I am pleasantly surprised with how well it works.",Great camera and App. Everything works as advertised.Pros:-SD Card which requires no cloud subscription and allows you to record a ton of video depending on your SD Card size-Motion sensing actually works and notifies you via phone notification or email.-Light and Siren work and are useful feature for deterrence.-All features in the new app actually work and work consistently.-WiFi stays connected and no connectivity issues or laggingCons:-Should include a USB cord extension. Had to buy one.Overall very satisfied with the camera and all its features. I have owned other cameras in the past and in my opinion this by far the best security camera you can buy at this price point.,451,79,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-SmartHome-Security-Spotlight-Weatherproof/dp/B07WK8FH3X/ref=sxin_13_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?cv_ct_cx=night+vision+security+camera&keywords=night+vision+security+camera&pd_rd_i=B07WK8FH3X&pd_rd_r=3fe1044d-1c7e-4143-9e52-63c6f9f049b9&pd_rd_w=MdJai&pd_rd_wg=zr6XZ&pf_rd_p=4ad71b32-b810-4124-8735-d02a39478d0c&pf_rd_r=Z3A6SQ00232NMDG3HMXW&qid=1640228976&sr=1-5-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyWTFVQzQxMFFGRlJOJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjg3MDkyMkRMNVpPVExHM09CNCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjcxMDY3Q0taVFhDNjVQU1hIJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3Bfc2VhcmNoX3RoZW1hdGljJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

Works well for the backyard.,Wireless Freedom - Ring Cam Battery,"New Camera, New Update!!","I have a Ring pro on my front door and loved it so much that I wanted something for the back patio since I have contracts (lawn, pool, trees, etc) in my backyard. My challenge however is that all the walls on the patio are either stucco or rock, which makes it near impossible to run a hidden power line. So I opted for this option and so far it works great. The lights are pretty bright and the motion detection works as expected.As for the battery life, it has been in for a couple weeks and it has lost about 10% battery. So I’m guessing it will last about 3 months before it needs a charge. I just ordered a second battery which should double that battery life.The connection is very quick, it seems to connect much faster than my front door, but in fairness it is closer to the wireless router.As for installation, I installed it using the provided screws into the frame of my patio door. It actually works perfect there because you can’t really see it and allows me to perfectly position it for motion detection.My only complaint is the motion zone setup. Unlike the ring pro where I can “draw” motion zones (which significantly helps reduce motion alerts), it only allows you to specify a distance. It really isn’t very intuitive, so I just leave it at mid-range and it seems to work just fine for now.Beware, in order to have video playback, you do have to subscribe to the ring premium service. And you have to have a subscription per device! I have it for my front door, not sure I’m gonna pay for the back door. That was kind of a bummer to find out I’d have to pay more. It should be a household subscription.Overall, I’m very happy with the device and would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to install solution without wires.",,We have this camera for the backyard and also the ring doorbell for the front door. We got the doorbell first and think it does the job. It is not the best nor is it the worst. Now the camera for the backyard is very nice. We got it as a safety precaution because we felt someone had used the pool while we were away and did not want that to be a safety issue. As you can see in these live pictures I just took that it covers pretty much the whole yard and you can zoom into areas on the app with your finger. Also pictured. We have the sensor set Just right to capture the movement in the backyard. At night when motion is detected the lights fire up to record. There is also an option to push an alarm on the light. It’s not super loud but loud enough for the neighbors to hear and scare persons away. I have also included a screenshot of the app view of the ring items we have.I would recommend this camera but really recommend using the solar panel with the camera and not have to worry about taking the battery out to charge it.,"Love the freedom of wireless, the solar panels work great and only need a couple of hours of sunlight per day to keep the batteries topped off. Video quality is great and I've got eyes on the whole yard now. Just picked up 3 of these beauties. Simply system anyone can install and operate. Thank You Ring!!I bought a camera system a few years ago with a hard drive a 4 wired cameras. Wires all over the house and you need a PHD in programming to get the system to work. It ended up in the trash without ever making a single recording. Ring just makes it all doable for the average Non PHD humans...","Updated Review:Received a new camera from Ring.

Great!,Value for money,Superb Deal!,"**3-19-2021–UPDATE OF ORIGINAL REVIEW**This camera appears to be well made, was easy to install and to adjust the camera to view the desired area. This camera also has a clear picture of it’s surroundings in daylight or with night vision. The motion detection feature is great and alerts my phone immediately. I just installed this camera today and so far I am quite impressed with it. Hopefully it will last for many years. UPDATE: The only issue I am experiencing with this outdoor camera so far is that when it goes offline I have to unplug the camera from the wall outlet and plug it back in in order for it to reboot itself. NOT very convenient when you are away from home and relying on your cameras for security :(I have purchased the Laview indoor camera since my first review and it will reboot itself when it occasionally goes offline so hopefully the same design can be implemented for the outdoor cameras too.","I bought two of these cameras and was so impressed that I bought two more. They work well, are easy to set up, and the price is right. The night vision is a little grainy but not to bad. I would recommend these.","Back in September (2020) I bought and installed two of Laview's indoor cameras, and have found them very reliable and easy to use, so I got one of their outdoor cameras this month (March 2021). It was very easy to install and *relatively* easy to set up on my network. (The process was identical to the indoor camera setup. I did have to trouble shoot a bit in the very beginning... the two things I learned were: 1: Do the initial network connection VERY close to your router/wifi source. The cameras can function farther out, with less robust wifi, but to avoid headaches, the INITIAL connection to your system has to be with excellent wifi signal. 2: I had a bit of a problem initially with the whole 2.4GHz/5GHz issue (their cameras only work on 2.4GHz, but my whole house mesh network is a combo, and I had problems connecting initially. I'm no network guru, I don't even pretend. But I set up a guest network that was only 2.4GHz and connected the cameras to that network. I don't know if I should, but I feel safer anyway having them ""walled off"" from my main wifi connection.The outdoor camera is now hooked up and running well for about a week. (It looks out on our chicken coop--it's nice to be able to make sure we've closed the door at night, etc., without having to traipse out there...) It's night view is AWESOME, by the way. The indoor cameras have decent night view, but not nearly the reach as this outdoor one does.Anyway, this camera is EXACTLY what I need. Its feed comes up on my phone reliably and instantly, and my other Laview cameras have been rock solid, with no down time, so I anticipate the same with this.An inexpensive yet highly useable camera. Can't comment about waterproof-ness, etc., but will edit this post if I feel the need....","It was a little difficult for me to figure out how to get it to record but that's nothing to do with the cameras, it because I'm a novice, lol. Once I put that SD in everything was good. The camera seems to be great so far if anything changes I'll for sure do an update.",Just hooked up in front of my driveway and it zooms and records with a micro 128 sd card you have to purchase separate. Sends motion detection to you cell phone.I just bought another on for the end of my driveway also.

You can see my other white ones in the background of my pics. I put this one under my deck and the black color conceals much better for it's placement. I tried a couple more expensive outdoor cameras, but these have been the best fit for me. They are really clear and work great with Alexa. With my Echo Show 5 and 8 I simply say ""Alexa show me the deck"" and a couple seconds later I have a live video feed. I could also use my phone, but find it easier on the Echo. I did have a little more trouble connecting these to my wifi than some of my other wireless cameras, but that may be due to my router. My only dislike is the ethernet cables for wired connection (I don't use them) and I really wish I could turn the IR lights off in the app. The IR's are pretty strong and bounce off the walls, causing a little distortion at night. I covered my IR sensors with electrical tape and installed Lifx IR bulbs on the deck, which are a perfect combo with my cameras. Overall, I'm VERY happy with these!!BTW, with my white cameras I simply installed them by cutting a piece of bar stock steal I bought for $5 at Lowes, drilled and tapped a couple holes, mounted the cameras to the bar stock, and just wedged it in my soffit. It might sound like a hack job, but it's actually a good sturdy fit with no holes in the house.",This is my second Netvue camera. The first was great but the motion was way to sensitive. They have since pushed a new update and it works perfectly!! My new one worked great straight out of the box! It was already up to date! If you want great 24 hour surveillance this is the one to choose! The night vision is crystal clear!,"The camera displays two doors on the porch. It has a microphone which works well to converse with someone on the porch. The netvue app is on my Android phone which has live display and microphone mode for remote use. After a month, everything has worked well. It is plugged into an outdoor outlet which is not ideal since someone could unplug it. If they took the camera with the micro card, I would not have a recording. There is an option to subscribe to Amazon Web Services to record motion ($20/year) or record 24/7 and have a 14- day access.","I was worried about installing and configuring a security camera as installing and configuring electronic devices is not one of my strong points. However the procedure was covered in a video with the app and is also covered in a you tube video. The questions and answers on the amazon page also help. I had to play around adjusting the sensitivity because the headlights from cars would trigger the motion detection, but adjustment solved this. The picture is very clear and the IR works OK as do the alerts. I got a 2:00 AM photo of a car prowler the first week I used it.",These cameras are great for our second home which we rent out on short term rentals while not there. The motion detection sends us an alert on our phones so we know when packages are delivered or guests come and go. I recommend putting in the 128 Gig micro SD card which then allows you to go back in time and see what was going on if you didn’t have time to or we’re busy when an alert came through. The cameras also have a microphone so you can also hear what’s going on and we can make sure there are no loud disturbances or parties going on. The motion detectors can be sensitive to our outdoor lights coming on or birds and snow/rain or snow melt but you can easily turn off motion detection and adjust its sensitivity. You can share the alerts and camera feeds with family or caretakers if they download the app and you send them a share link. Haven’t caught any game animals yet but I think it’s only a matter of time. They do require a plug in so you have to plan a little on location and we needed power extensions which were easily available also on Amazon. They occasionally go offline and can be rebooted by unplugging the power and they start right back up but if you live far away and don’t have someone local to do that for you you’ll be offline until you return. Customer support/service was fairly quick and helpful. Overall a great value with lots of features. I really like that I don’t have to pay any monthly subscription. I think they have a cloud service at a modest price if desired. I a very pleased with my purchase and that’s why I bought a second one and am considering some for my primary residence.,3223,515,https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Camera-Wireless-I-Detection/dp/B07X2M8KTR/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=night+vision+security+camera&qid=1640228976&sr=8-4

All of these old cameras are/were Dlink 720p bullet-cams that are 6 to 8 years old, which I paid $300 each for back then. I wanted to upgrade to much higher resolution cameras to be able to recognize faces, read license plates at a distance, and other details which are/were impossible with the old 720p cameras.Skeptical, I only ordered two of these, one is this bullet-cam model, another is the dome model RLC-420-5MP, which appears to have the same guts in a different package.Very easy to install. I already had PoE ethernet hard-wired to these camera locations (and dozens of others), so it was literally plug-and-play. I changed the IP address from DHCP to hard-coded IP address so my Blue Iris DVR software knows where to find them.Picture quality was an amazing upgrade from the old Dlink camera, and night vision works great as well, as you can see from the photos. The porch shots are from the dome camera, the driveway/yard shots are the bullet camera. I can't speak to any of the software features since I'm using advanced third-party NVR software, but the video quality is top-notch, and it easily sends 25fps at full resolution of 2560x1920, with many options on max bitrate. It can go as high as 8192kb/s, I have it set to 6144 kb/s and the video is smooth and quality is crystal clear.I plan to give these cameras a week or two to make sure there are no surprises, then I am replacing the other 12 with these and probably adding a few additional cameras, but early results are these are amazing cameras at any price, but especially for under $100 each. I included a photo (and marked it) of the same angle using the old Dlink 720p camera for comparison, you can see what a massive improvement it is.","Update on the support issue. It appears the problem was not due to a defective camera. Blue Iris works fine when this camera when ""reolink RLC-410"" is selected. But this camera had been configured in Blue Iris as a generic ONVIF. In that mode, the decode errors lead to video artifacts. When I switched the camera type from generic to reolink, the symptom stopped manifesting.Thank you very much for the good email support from the vendor.For Blue Iris users, select MPG4 rather than MPG5 for compatibility with Blue Iris, and choose Reolink RLC-410 as the camera type.I now have four reolink cameras, three RLC-410-5MP and one RLC-411S. I am happy with all of them.=-=-=-I used to be happy with this camera. I own three of the RLC-410-5MP plus one of the prior 4MP models. Two of my 410s work fine. Unfortunately the 3rd one I bought is glitching all the time. About 20 times a day, i get rectangles at the bottom of the picture with vertical line distortion. The vendor is asking me to stare at the camera web page to catch it in the act. ?!?!?!? How can I spend my day staring at a camera web page? That's what NVRs are for. So far I am having trouble resolving this issue. Hopefully they'll come through. Obviously this is a defective unit. (Photo uploaded showing the glitchiness.)=-=-=- prior review below, from before receiving the 3rd (defective) unit -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-I am quite happy with this camera. I have 3 of them around my house, along with a smattering of GW, Dahua, Hik and other Reolinks. These new reolink 5MP cameras seem fairly good. The pictures are relatively sharp. The camera is capable of a decent bit rate. I am getting typically 2-5Mb/s in the camera's highest resolution at 10fps. I don't use any of the storage or motion activation features of these cameras. I drive them all from Blue Iris on a Core i7 with nVidia graphics. I highly recommend this combination. But NVR aside, as a slave to a really good NVR like Blue Iris, this camera performs very well for the price point compared to other similar units. Looks like Reolink got to market with 5MP a little earlier than much of their competition. (Though I see now there's also an 8MP in the market! Gotta try it for capturing license plates of porch pirates!)","This is a great little camera. There are still things I am figuring out but after running it for a full 24 hours I like it. I originally bought it to keep a watchful eye over my mailbox after someone knocked it off it's stand but I have come to learn the limitations of a 55$ camera. My mailbox is simply to far away, during the day at highest motion sensitivity the camera will detect people walking in the street. But at night time even at highest motion sensitivity walking in the street does not set off the MD, however all the bugs coming up to check out the infrared lights do. I mounted it on the soffit and I had some problems with the install as a 3/4 inch hole saw as recommended in the install guide did not make a big enough hole. You can get the top part of the water proofing cap through the hole but it then gets stuck on the part that holds the ethernet cord. I took a stanley knife to the plug and cut off enough of the plastic for the plug to fit. I would recommend going up one size and using a 7/8 inch hole saw, which is what I will do if I install another one of these. I've changed the recording now to do motion sensor during the day and normal recording at night time. I'm still not sure I'll catch anyone knocking off my mailbox, I think I'll actually need to upgrade to a model with zoom for that, but I can't fault the camera for that.I think the windows client app works well once you get the hang of it, it can be a little confusing that there are settings directly for the camera, in the case of an SD card being inserted, and then settings for the windows client app. I have not done any recording onto an SD card so I can't speak to that. The iPhone app works great, simple setup, and when I initially plugged the camera into my POE switch the app detected it right away.All in all a great camera for what it is.","I have 7 IP based cameras and 5 inline cameras many of which have needed replacing over the last 5 years or so. So I have owned a few. I wanted POE and 5 MP so I chose the RLC-410-5MP. The first thing I noticed was the ease in aligning the camera and the single tightening screw, the best I have seen yet. Setup took a few minutes using Blue Iris DVR software. I like this camera so much I felt it needed a review. Sometimes for laughs I read reviews and wonder what people are thinking. Apparently many of these reviews are fake also but this is a great camera and I wish my friend had taken my advice when he purchased his. This camera does everything I want at the best possible price.","I have a home setup with a variety of different brand cameras including WansView, Foscam and now this Reolink one. I run NetCam Studio on my home server and have a 16 camera license on it. I had to replace my outdoor Foscam 8905W which after 3 solid years of Michigan weather finally went non-responsive. I really enjoyed the 8905W because it had excellent nightvision and can view objects around 100 ft away from my house in the backyard with ease.When I started looking for a replacement for this camera I was going between this Reolink model and a 1.3 MP TRENDnet model. My requirements this time around was something that was PoE (because I had already pulled an ethernet cable) and had at least 100ft of night vision capability. Since the Reolink model was supported natively in Netcam Studio I went ahead and took a chance ordering it even though the TRENDnet one had a stated 3 year warranty and had more positive reviews.I was pleased when the Reolink model arrived and noticed a 2 year warranty when you register the product = bonus. Then I was even more pleased when I downloaded the iOS configuration app and it was seamless to get configured with wizards that make it easy and enough advanced options that a techie tweaker like me make changes. That coupled with being PoE made physical installation the easiest I've had yet. I actually spent more time uninstalling my old camera than I did setting this one up from open of box to configured with my server.After one night of running it I am EXTREMELY pleased with the wide view angle of this. It blows my old Foscam model out of the water (at a lesser price!) I can view almost my entire backyard from the same mounting location where I could only see a small section previously. Also the image quality and frame rate is fantastic. I actually had to reduce the resolution and bitrate so that my server could keep up with recording. Having audio is an added bonus as well.Overall now owning 20ish cameras in this price class I can say hands down this is the best camera I own and am considering replacing one of my other outdoor units with this. Would definitely purchase again and suggest any users of NetCam Studio to not waste their time with other cameras in this price range if you're able to hard wire.",1950,348,https://www.amazon.com/Reolink-Surveillance-Security-Detection-RLC-410-5MP/dp/B07C5JWK4K/ref=sxin_13_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?cv_ct_cx=night+vision+security+camera&keywords=night+vision+security+camera&pd_rd_i=B07C5JWK4K&pd_rd_r=3fe1044d-1c7e-4143-9e52-63c6f9f049b9&pd_rd_w=MdJai&pd_rd_wg=zr6XZ&pf_rd_p=4ad71b32-b810-4124-8735-d02a39478d0c&pf_rd_r=Z3A6SQ00232NMDG3HMXW&qid=1640228976&sr=1-4-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyWTFVQzQxMFFGRlJOJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjg3MDkyMkRMNVpPVExHM09CNCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDc2NTMzMk9SNzFLVUFFRE5YTiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX3NlYXJjaF90aGVtYXRpYyZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

Lorex must have done something to improve this model camera because it does a lot better than the older one (which was excellent in it' day). The night vision on this is so much better than the older one that the picture on my monitor looks like it is day time when actually I took this picture of my monitor at 1 a.m. with the outside porch light turned off. The new camera is number 4 on the picture of the monitor and the others are the original 5 year old cameras. This camera makes such a good difference that after I write this review I am going to order the 4 pack of this camera and replace all of my cameras.,This is an add on for our existing lorex security system. These cameras are superior to the 4 that came with the original system as the mounting bracket has improved to allow more flexibility in positioning the camera. Night vision is okay but could be better. All in all this was a good buy and we will be adding one more camera in the future.,I have the older LBV2531S-C models and they work well but optics and clarity did leave something to desire. I ordered the newer model LBV2531U-C and am really pleased. Night vision is far better and clarity is absolutely great. Able to expand pictures and still have great definition and recognition capability. Will be replacing all my older models with this newer model as time and money become available.,These cameras are great and just what we needed to connect to our existing Loren DVR,This camera 1080P works great with the Lorex 6 camera 4K system I got at Costco. I was afraid it may not work when ordering but was soon relieved when I installed it. The camera even came with the needed cable.,178,17,https://www.amazon.com/1080p-Analog-Add-Security-Camera/dp/B07SBS5BVJ/ref=sxin_13_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?cv_ct_cx=night+vision+security+camera&keywords=night+vision+security+camera&pd_rd_i=B07SBS5BVJ&pd_rd_r=3fe1044d-1c7e-4143-9e52-63c6f9f049b9&pd_rd_w=MdJai&pd_rd_wg=zr6XZ&pf_rd_p=4ad71b32-b810-4124-8735-d02a39478d0c&pf_rd_r=Z3A6SQ00232NMDG3HMXW&qid=1640228976&sr=1-1-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&psc=1&smid=A1SF2PRM51SGFU&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyWTFVQzQxMFFGRlJOJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjg3MDkyMkRMNVpPVExHM09CNCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDM0NjgzMzM1MjRKMTQ2MFIxOSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX3NlYXJjaF90aGVtYXRpYyZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

Stupid easy to install and setup, including the smartphone app.Picture is razor sharp.Installed my system with a dedicated power supply and custom length rg58 siamesed cables. Did not use any of the supplied wires or power adapters. Only used the DVR and cameras.Put the DVR and power supply in basement and ran all cables to them.Got a long HDMI cable and long USB cable so I can monitor and control everything from my nightstand while laying in bed.Everything works fantastic !!!","First, setup was not too bad, if you’re handy, it will be easy to install and program. Utilizing existing co-axial cables and stabilized power supply. One thing I really like about it is it comes with everything, so you can set it up directly without make additional trips to store for some cables/cords.* Images: The images displayed on the system are very clear and more remarkably. In a lower light environment they will switches to black and white. So the cameras apparently have very good light sensitivity.* View: These cameras have phenominal quality and the field of view is so much greater than my older cameras.I've only had this system for a couple of weeks, and don't even have all of the camera's connected yet (though I did test them). In a year, once I can speak to longevity, I will return to give an update to the product. So far, however, I'm very pleased.","I do not give out praise often; in fact, this is my first Product Review in 5+ years. But I absolutely had to share my experiences with Annke Tech Support as their level of assistance and patience and accommodation was nothing short of phenomenal. After initially emailing them, they evaluated my request and responded to me within 13 hours (time zone gap included) and said that Tech Support would reach out in 24 hours. They reached out in 2...just excellent. From there, they were extremely responsive to help me troubleshoot my issue and we emailed back and forth a few times. Eventually, THEY determined that email would not resolve the issue so we had a Remote Desktop Sharing session to efficiently find resolution. We lost connection at one point, and Tech Support even CALLED ME to make sure we were still able to proceed. About 30 minutes later, I'm all set and happily keeping their product. As I am sure many of you have experienced poor customer service at some point in your life, you can rest easy that this company cares about their product and customers. If a positive review on their customer service is not enough to convince you to buy....allow me to review their product.Summary  Customer Service is Unparalleled. Price is Excellent. Video Quality is Great. Setup is fairly straight-forward. Some improved/updated instructions would be beneficial, but manageable as is. Interface could be improved to enhance experience, but ok.I spent a decent amount of time reading product descriptions and reviews for Home Video Surveillance and simply could not find anything that matched the price or positive reviews. Sure, there are some eyebrow-raising comments in some of the reviews, but nothing truly concerning. Some folks are expecting too much out of Nightvision, in general. This system performs above its price point. Sure, there are $1,000+ systems out there that will outperform this product, but that's not what you are buying. This system is a great middle ground between buying one/two over-priced Nest or Ring cameras that are merely selling their name and buying a 'high-end' surveillance system, which is probably overkill for you home. If you really need a system like that, then you should probably consider moving to a better area. You are going to get enough product (8 cameras and a DVR and remote access) to satisfy almost everyone’s surveillance needs.The quick setup guide provided was fairly straight-forward. I was able to connect it to my Smartphone without issue, easy. Adding the SADP Tool to my networked laptop was a bit more effort. The link provided in the guide was not accurate / retired, so a quick search on Annke's website located the software then back to the guide to complete setup. Not the end of the world, just be patient. If you cannot find it, email them. My 'issue', which required Tech Support, was that remote connection via the Web was no longer supported, despite being included in the guide. While this was a bit deceiving and frustrating, Tech Support was able to find a work-around and use Port Forwarding to allow me the type of access I was interested in. Most people will probably not need this, but I prefer laptops over phones and tablets, so it was a deal-breaker for me if no resolution…plus I didn’t want to have to install the SADP Tool on all of my laptops (again, I may be abnormal as I have 4 laptops in my home, but just sharing my experiences). Thankfully, Annke was able to help.Other than that, just know that the SADP Tool, Web, and DVR (i.e. direct connection between DVR and Monitor) interfaces are not overly user-friendly, but with some tinkering, you get used to the buttons and how to use the system. Again, not that big of a deal when you consider what you are getting for the price.If you are debating between this product and a competitor, give Annke a shot knowing that they will take care of you if you need help.","Only had it up and running for a day but very happy with it. Very clear, night vision is much better then our old system that cost more than this one. The camera's are plastic, but they won't rust.

Also what I found to be fantastic, was that you can make search around the room to look around if needed right within the app, without moving your cameras. The night vision is pretty good as well.

Each camera comes with a sd card to insert in camera for memory, so no extra purchase is required.","When I ordered I didn’t realize that it was a plug in device.

Highly recommend.,Surprise me with this AFFORDABLE price!!!,Great inexpensive security camera,"An excellent security camera price, build quality, software and online support.","Honestly this camera exceeded my expectations immensely. Motion detection works flawlessly and has different modes, and most of all, night footage is very clear for a 1080p camera.I was most worried about the night video quality, as there were no visible ir lights on the camera housing, but they were there and work very well. Daytime recording is also quite crisp with little to no lag/delay while displaying live video to the app. There are also options to manually turn on led lights, even a siren is an option.There are options to install an SD card for local storage, no need for expensive cloud storage subscriptions(although available) and the Wifi connection is very easy to set up with the app. I recommend a “endurance” micro sd card for best reliablility.All of the mounting hardware is included in the box, including screws, anchors, as well as a screwdriver. I had no problems installing this on my vinyl siding with some clips I bought off amazon as well. I would advise to run this off ac power, however so far the battery is still at 100% after 2 days.Overall a great security camera, would recommend to anybody. Hopefully you find this review useful.","This security camera is fairly inexpensive compared to Ring or Nest, but provides equal or better video with lots of additional functionalities.Build quality-Excellent, outside is hard plastic and feels very solid with good weight on it. Size is comparable to Ring Spotlight cam.Video quality-Great 1080p video quality during day light. Night video is a bit grainy but comparable to Ring Spotlight cam. There are 2 choices of video for night time video, black/white with infrared or color with light on. Both are usage.Easy of use-Easy to set up with download of Vico Home app. Once you pair with camera and enter Wi-Fi (2.4 gz only) infomoratin, you can do all the setup and control right from the app. It's fairly easy to use with good user interface.Extras-1. This is a big one. It comes with FREE 7-days cloud storage without needing to pay or sing up any service plan. This is much better and cheaper than Ring/Nest in the long run. The cloud upload functionality is also excellent. Once motion is detected, video is captured and I usually am able to view the video within a few seconds. 7-day cloud storage for free but you also have a choice to pay for longer term storage.2. The power cable is standard micro usb cable that is detached from the unit. This is a big advantage compared to Nest or Ring, where the power wire is built-into the unit. Standard micro usb cable means i can run power much easier from inside the house, through siding to power the camera, instead of Ring that requires power outlet outside and nearby.Overall, for the price this security camera provides an unbeatable value compared to similar function Ring or Nest. Highly recommended!",,"I bought this wireless security camera about 2 weeks back. So far, I'm very satisfied with its performance. It is very easy to sync with the phone and ready to be used. The price seems to be very reasonable for the features available on it. I placed this camera pointing towards my door so that I get notified of the movement of the person when nobody is at home. It works like a charm. The 2-way conversation works very well. Also, the feature I liked the most was to set an alarm and turn the flashlight on. So far, I'm very satisfied with the product and highly recommend it.",,30,29,https://www.amazon.com/Lybuorze-Spotlights-Detection-Rechargeable-Surveillance/dp/B09K3NFSCF/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=outdoor+battery+powered+security+camera+with+smartphone+app&qid=1640229862&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&smid=A39EMLL82PJRE6&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzMVBaT1hKUUoxNk1PJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDQyOTA2MVhXSVMxV1VCMDlWUCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzQ0OTkwMkJHWkcwNExQNlFMRCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

With the new indoor cam I can now access all my cams from one app. To me the picture quality is great overall and especially in total darkness. Live view connection is a lot more stable than my Wyze cams. Alexa integration is a big plus, no need for third party hacks to complete routines. Because I already have Ring cameras it’s worth it to pay a little more over a Wyze cam.","In February, I noticed my ADHD medication ran out early. I’m very careful about taking it exactly as prescribed so it was strange that I had run out 10 days early. For reasons I won’t get into for this review, I suspected the property manager of my building was stealing it. Obviously that sounded crazy, but I couldn’t think of another explanation. A friend suggested a Ring camera, so I bought one never expecting anything to actually come of it. I put some antihistamines in my now empty pill bottle thinking no one would ever take them, set up the camera when it arrived, and felt more secure knowing it was there. Set up was simple so I figured worst case scenario, I was out a bit of money and I spent maybe 10 minutes setting it up.Fast forward a week later when I get a notification via the app that there was motion detected on my camera. I open up the recording and there she is, entering my apartment, going right for my decoy pills, taking them, and leaving. I immediately left work to get back home. I called the police who sent an officer. I showed him the video and he admitted that had I not had the video, he wouldn’t have believed me. I was able to quickly and easily send the video to the police and to the president of the company that owns my building. I also was able to download the video and get it uploaded so that I have copies of it as I go through the next few months as she (hopefully) gets brought to justice.I cannot emphasize how much this little camera has helped me. I would not have caught my burglar otherwise. Because of it, they were able to look up records of who used their electronic key to access my apartment and she had been in there 7 times over the month prior. This would have gone on for longer and who knows if it would have resulted in harm to myself or my cat had I not caught her. This camera has given some of the sense of security she stole from me back and stopped a nightmare situation from worsening. I will still be recovering from this for long time and I am hoping she is brought to justice, but I cannot thank Ring enough for helping me secure my home from an unexpected source of danger.","This camera for $60 is a solid deal.

It's like looking outside the window at your yard. Even better at night since you can't see hardly anything looking out the window but you can see everything with the cameras! Installation is kind of exhausting if done in the summer time! However that would be any camera system that's hard wired, which I would recommend anyway that way you don't have to bog down your wireless routers bandwidth with your camera system. I have hooked up my cameras with the app and it works very well. They only down side is they say it's Syseye in the pictures but it's actually Sgseye which I had to do some research into other comments and questions answered to find out. The app works pretty good but if you want to save a playback it doesn't seem to work it just saves a corrupt file you can't watch. I'm not sure about on the actual recorder since I haven't tried that yet. The TVR works pretty good and automatically rewrites over the old video as it gets full which is very nice, the only downside to the TVR I can say is that it's pretty loud at night, but not very noticeable during the day. I would keep that in mind when deciding where you want to install it. Ours is in the living room so it's not an issue for us. I would recommend this system for the price with the 2tb hard drive is a great deal and it works very well. I've had ours hooked up and working with all 8 cameras for a couple months with no issues aside from spiders leaving webs in front of the cameras >.<","Based on one week of usage, here is my initial review:Installation & Setup - Very EasyNight Vision - Very ClearPicture Quality - High-quality HDMotion Detection - Very Good,very sensitiveNotifications - Good, i can get the alarm notifications in time.Weatherproof-Very Good, it is metal shell, good heat dissipation.Continuous recording mode captures everything.Which allows me do not miss any wonderful moment.I choose to store the recordings in the cloud.Because this makes feel safe about my privacy.I can download the videos any time.Overall, I like this camera and recommend this to others.","The camera is well packed, everything is neatly laid inside.

You can use cloud storage, as well as negotiate with the companion. And i recommend use the cloud storage, because big enough, when you check the playback video,it's very smoothly, never freeze. We bought 1 camera for installation in an apartment for an elderly person to look after him. Then convinced of the efficiency bought two more. The seller is decent, offers advice on installation and support at any time.",So I have a crazy neighbor. she only does stuff to us when she knows I don’t have my phone out watching her. So I bought this. Put it on the back of our shed to cover our whole back half of the yard. Was easily installed and set up. And ordered 2 more after watching the live feed one to get the front half of our back yard and the other the get the front of the house. It’s a good camera for the price.

The fact that this can be used outdoors and can endure the elements makes it perfect.","Update:I use 5 at my house. I like them so much, I installed 2 at my grandmother’s house to keep an eye on her declining health and talk to her. Glad I did! 2 days later she fell and we were able to call 911 for her. I was 90 miles away and able to communicate with the Paramedics and have my parents meet them at the hospital.Original review:Excellent camera and easy to use.I see some reviews complaining about they couldn't get the camera to connect. I had the same issue, but I figured out. These cameras need a 2.4GHz WiFi network with a WPA/WPA2 protocol. Wyze Devices cannot be connected to a 5GHz network. So go into your router settings and change it. Many have the option to run both at the same time, which is what I did.Also, if you're having an issue at the QR code screen, where is says scan with cam. It means the Wyze cam, not your phone camera. Just point your phone at the camera and it will sync.","The image quality is superb. The motion can be separated to detect normal motion or persons which is extremely helpful to minimize false positives. It is tiny, lightweight, easy to install and cheap.The only con so far is a somewhat diminished WiFi range compared to my previous v2 cam; not a whole bunch. However, the fact that this one is weather resistant compensates in my book.Pleased with my camera. Thumbs up for sure.",My wyze cam came in today. Within 3 minutes this tiny camera was up and running. I did already have a wyze account. It had to complete 3 firmware updates. I had to log out of my app and log back in.

I have had CCTV cameras in my house for years. I've been using Swann wired cameras for the most part with mixed emotions. But running new wires to upgrade the system just didn't excite me.I had been looking at NEST cams since I have the smart Thermostats and Smoke/Carbon-monoxide detectors for a while, but the price is ridiculous! Plus your only option with them is cloud service (an additional cost). Then I spoke with a neighbor who sent me a screen shot from his YI camera. I must say, the quality was pretty impressive.So I bought a four pack for $119.00 with moderate expectations. Let me tell you I'm super impressed with the picture quality of these cameras. Set up is quick and easy. When I purchased them I had no idea they had audio as well. The audio quality is incredible, plus it's a two way speaker. Purchased 32 GB SD cards for all of them so I didn't need to use cloud storage and it's been working great! I have them set to record all motion and I usually have about 7 days of history on each camera.Day and night vision are both spectacular IMO. I have attached several photos so you can see the quality both day and night. Side note, I have a couple ""indoor cams"" mounted outside. To do this I purchased a rubber sleeve/cover from Amazon to make the drop cam weather resistant for outdoor application. It's been through rain, sleet and snow with out issue so far. Link to cover: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FD5XHMP/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1A couple cons, the power cable is sooooooo short. I had to purchased longer cables for a couple of my installs. No biggie, they are only a few dollars here on Amazon. The app for iOS is very functional, but it has no multi camera view which would be a nice option.","So I have been using the Yi 1080p indoor camera system for 2 weeks now and I LOVE IT! The camera's are crystal clear during the day and are just as sharp in night mode. The added features of being able to hide any ""lights"" such as the blue power light and the typical red IR lights for night vision makes ""hiding"" these cameras a breeze. The playback function works great and give you the time in hours, minutes & seconds. The 2 way talk feature works great and has 2 modes, 1 is a push to talk feature where when you press the button you cannot hear what the person on the camera is saying and the 2nd is a continuous talk where you and the person on the camera can talk back and forth without pressing any buttons (love this feature) the 32gig on board storage is also a great bonus. Like I said I have been using the cameras for about 2 weeks and have barely used 3 gigs of space. (for an idea of the amount of traffic, it's just me, my wife and our 2 pets) so the cameras don't get a ton of action during the week. But are always recording on any motion. (I do not subscribe to the cloud storage as for I haven't seen a need) Anytime you get an alert it will store it on the app and you can upload it to your mobile device and share it with others. The initial motion detection clip is only 6 seconds, but if you wait till the end of the 6 seconds you will get an option to ""view entire motion"" which will bring up that camera, rewind to when it first detected the motion and play it back until there is no longer any motion, GREAT feature. All of the features seem to work as expected, you can set times for your camera to alert you when it detects motion and zones so that your dog walking around doesn't keep triggering the alerts. I can say the motion detection is VERY sensitive. You can set the setting to low, medium or high but really I can't tell a difference low to high. I have one camera facing out of my front window and it picks up shadows, car lights, leaves blowing, etc. Not a big deal, but on a windy day I can get a ton of alerts. The app works great, you can set a PIN or use your fingerprint to log into the cameras so in the event your phone is stolen, unless they have your PIN or fingerprint they will not be able to pull up your cameras. Connecting them was very simple and took less than 5 minutes per camera. Plug them in, scan the UR code and they will automatically connect to the network your phone is connected to. The packaging was very nice, didn't feel cheap. All cameras were individually wrapped along with all of the accessories. Comes with instruction booklet for assistance with installing/setup. The camera (black part) can be removed from the white base and mounted in different areas. They also sell (separately) wall mounts for the cameras. (cheap, like $10-$15 for a 4 pack) or you can stand them up anywhere you like (they have a round rubber grip on the bottom to help keep them from sliding around. All 4 cameras come with a USB cord and power brick. The USB cord is about 10-12 feet long so you should be able to place these cameras wherever you'd like. OK so I hope this rant...I mean review was helpful. If you're anything like me, I read all the reviews on a product before I make a purchase. Thanks for reading!***(I am not affiliated with Yi or any of there products, this was simple a consumer review, please purchase these at your own risk)***","I purchased the Yi 4 pk. 1080 Indoor security cameras. I was skeptical but am so glad I took the chance. I placed them in various windows facing outside as it’s outside I want to observe. They work perfectly during the day and, where the outside area is lit, at night. If the area is not lit, there is a reflection on the glass from the IR light, but they ARE designed to be indoor cameras. They work very well indoors, day and night, as intended. I have observed some sketchy people that have rung my doorbell when I’m not home (I have a camera in the window next to door), along with the neighbor’s cat, a family of raccoons, an opossum and numerous squirrels. I had an issue where they stopped alerting me of activity (which I see some others have had, also) and contacted Yi customer service. They promptly replied to my request and worked with me to make sure all my phone settings were correct. Turned out, the problem was with my phone settings, battery saver shutting down the app, NOT with the cameras or their app. I especially love that I can insert my own sd cards to save & view past events and not have to pay for ‘cloud’ subscription. I don’t know of another security camera that offers this. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase! In fact, I ordered another set of 4. If you are still in doubt, look up some reviews and comparisons of the Yi cameras on youtube.",,"Best Security Option for a home because:1. Its a one time charge- no monthly subscription- and all of the features of the camera work with the SD card2.

This is the best camera!!!,"Finally a reliable, solid outdoor camera",Excellent technology which truly works!,Amazing sensors with better picture quality,MUST BUY - WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!,This battery camera is hands down amazing! It’s incredibly easy to set up and operate. I just downloaded the app and connected it to WiFi. The clarity is perfection! I love that you can set all of the features to different sensitivity settings.,"I found this camera due to user reviews, so I wanted to pay it forward. This is has been an excellent security camera, and it is well worth a consideration.I was concerned about getting a camera from a brand I did not recognize. But truthfully, all the bigger name brands seemed to have something wrong with them. For me, I was struggling to find cameras that connected to my wireless network consistently. I also didn’t want to rely on a cloud based server that could be hacked. No monthly service either, please.This camera solved all those problems. The connection didn’t take long at all, and they offer several different ways to do it. It needs a micro sd card, but those are inexpensive. You have the option to connect the app of the camera to your photo roll to download pictures and video, too, so you can pull from the sd card anytime you want.I think the real winning feature here is the ability to rotate the camera. They don’t hit your over the head about it either. In the app, when watching live video, you basically swipe your finger on the screen of your phone to tell the camera which direction you want it to go. I can turn the camera all the way from my front doorway, past my cars parked in the driveway, to swing around to the curb outside my house and beyond. When suspicious things may be happening outside, this is an awesome tool. Can I admit it too? It’s almost fun. The camera moves slowly but silently.It does not auto track, though, but still.Auto detection is pretty good. Night vision looks really crisp. The image is all around very good. I have a Ring doorbell that does not hold a candle to this camera.Latency is usually very low. I haven’t used the two way audio really.I wish it had some siren or alarm sound as an option. A manual button for that would be easy and useful.It’s not small. If you are trying to conceal your cameras, this is the wrong choice. For me, I WANT the camera to be seen. I would rather deter someone than catch them in the act afterwards.I highly recommend the ctronics camera, then, and it’s pretty affordable. Well worth a try if you are struggling to find a new camera.","After doing some careful research to find a new solution to monitor the outside of my home, I came upon these new camera's and thought to give them a try, I bought two. These camera's replace two different name brands which simply did not work well as security cameras. The set up upon arrival was a breeze and syncing to my wifi network was not a problem unlike other camera brands. When charging, contrary to the instructions, there is no green light indicator, only a red light which turns off once charged. The batteries charged for 4 hours upon arrival and after two months, the new charge was 8 hours each.After two months of operation, both camera's work great and as indicated. The latency or time to react is quite good. I no longer capture the back of people's heads only and these camera's have already caught two people entering my property, bad neighbors!These camera's are App driven only, no base station to deal with. You have excellent control of the camera's via the app so you can just set it and forget it until it pings. I also added two 128GB micro SD cards as required to store content and there is no end, meaning once the cards are full, they are overwritten, so no need to delete anything. These camera's charge via a USB phone cable and the first charge last some two months of use which included set up use.Overall, these are the best home security cams I have used which are cost effective, simple and with no monthly or annual fee's. Now that I have two, I might just add two more for a maximum of four allowed via the app.",I really like the motion sensors and the rotation. With the app you can rotate the camera. Amazing. I def. recommend this camera as it has alot of features in this price. I clicked the picture from the camera and you can see the clarity too.,"We got this product 3 days ago, and i wanted to test it out before writing a review. We have this camera outside right above our garage and we love it. We can see very clearly at night & there’s no crazy wires. It’s battery powered so it makes for a nice clean look. It’s also very easy to install and use and the app is easy to work as well. I def recommend this camera for anything. It watches our cars & boat. We just bought another one for the backyard.

A good economical  NVR System",Buy it.,Good system for the price!,STRONGLY RECOMMEND,"Let me start this review with the tech support. The personnel at HiSeeU are fantastic to deal with and very helpful with all of your questions. They have answered most of my questions within 4 to 5 hours via email. I have not tried the phone support. They have answered questions that are outside of normal tech support as I am an engineer and wanted to know some of the details of the system and connections.The system arrived without issues and was packaged in a relatively small box considering that it contained a base station (NVR), four cameras with antennas, one extended antenna (about 10 feet long cable for remote antenna placement), one mouse, one HDMI cable, one 3 foot ethernet cable, one external power supply for the NVR, four external power supplies for the cameras, mounting hardware (screws and plugs) for each of the cameras to include four Allen wrenches to adjust the camera mounts. Also included was the setup instructions and two rather large yellow stickers for posting that cameras were in use.The instructions I will say need a little bit of work as I believe that they do not match 100% the current software. The basic information for how to access some of the menus and initial connections is needed. I did not have an issue as I have been testing systems like these for a few years for use in tropical areas.I chose to connect the NVR first. I installed a 3 Tb full size hard disk into the system. This is pretty strait forward for connections however I did have an issue with the actual mounting of the HDD. The case is more designed around a smaller laptop HDD so screw placements align right in the case. As I was utilizing a full size HDD I was only able to connect two of the screws for mounting but the full size HDD fit and is secure within the housing of the NVR.It should be noted that the NVR has a VGA monitor port, and HDMI port, one RJ45 (Ethernet) port and one USB 2.0 port. There is also one power input port and no on/off switch.I connected the NVR to my monitor (could have connected to TV or other monitor) via the HDMI and connected the provided mouse to the USB port. I them attached the power, within about 10 seconds I received the splash screen and the unit was booted within about 1 minute after that. It is a bit slower than some systems to boot but was acceptable.Once booted you are provided with language options and then manual or automatic setup. Being an engineer and know-it-all, I selected the manual (you may want to select auto). By doing this it allowed me to go through the setup and allowed me to understand what the software was doing. After hunting around the menus and playing with different items I reset the system and connected the ethernet to the device to my router. I booted the system again and to my amazement the system was able to identify my network and obtain an IP address without issues. I went into the network menus and changes the system to utilize a static IP address (for example 192.168.1.60) and then restarted the system. I found in the menus that after any change you MUST select the APPLY button and not assume that selecting OK will work as it does not. You MUST select APPLY for changes to take effect. LESSON #1While the system was rebooting, I downloaded the app for this device. There are several that will work but they recommend using the IP Pro 3 app. Ignore the reviews as it is a simple app that for the last 5 days has worked well and without issues. If you are a Blink user it is similar but has more functionality which is what I think throws people off. After the app was loaded and an account was created, I added my system to the app. This was a very simple task as it involved just scanning in a QR barcode, wait a few seconds, connection is made. I did not need to adjust any firewall setting or any other parameters. It connected without issues.Once all of this was completed and I was sure that I could identify the NVR on my network and could also connect with the app I started connecting the cameras one at a time. There is a page in the menus that identifies each of the cameras and provides the IP address for each. The system utilizes the 172.14.20.xx address range. The connections are also pretty strait forward, put the camera on a table close by, attach the antenna, attach the power supply and then wait a few seconds. The cameras have been pre-matched to the NVR prior to chipping to make it easy. If you have one of the cameras that does not connect contact Johnny at HiSeeU and he/she will send you simple to follow instruction with pictures on how to reconnect and sync the camera. DO NOT HIT THE RESET BUTTON ON THE CAMERA. There is no need to hit this button. I only did by accident when putting on one of the weather proofing caps. LESSON #2Once you have all the cameras connected and you see the actual video on the screen, I would recommend that you restart the system to ensure that all items are functional. Remember LESSON#1Take you time playing around in the menus on the NVR as well as with the app and adjust all the motion or recording settings prior to placing the cameras out an about. This will save having to reinstall at a later time if you mess up. I found that sensitivity around 50% to be good around a patio area but needed to lower it to around 30% in the yard and in areas that birds fly around adjust the other way so as to not be triggered all the time.You can set each camera recording individually or as groups for three different types of recording, Option-1 is to record all the time, Option-2 is to record on motion and Option-3 is to record on alarm. The third option is really not available yet as I do not believe they have the alarm devices yet. These would be simple contact alarms. As I am testing the system for myself and others, I have both Option-1 and Option-2 selected so I receive 24/7 recording as well as motion recordings. This is nice to have and different that some of the other systems out there.I had placed one of the cameras out about 150 feet from my home which is wood and stucco Santa Fe built. I was able via the menus able to see the received signal dB level and for this camera it was about 22 dB which is very low. The camera would come in and out of connection and was not really functional at this distance. I had purchased one the WiFi Range Extender that HiSeeU offers (ASIN B07FY81P8X) as I knew some would be far away and would need some help. I do have other systems out there that function but they are in a way different price range so I expect more from them. Once you have configured the extender you can, through the menus, select and attach the camera to the extender. No need to push any buttons or hit any resets as this will cause you nothing but issues and time. It is very nice the way you can reconfigure the system. As a not, after discussions with Johnny he advised that you do not need to have the extender as each camera can also act as an extender. Through the menus you can daisy chain camera to meet your needs and string them out using the camera as the range extender. You will notice a slight delay f a few seconds between each extended camera but if it is not time critical it is not an issue.If you want to access the system from a PC and not have to utilize the mouse on the NVR then I would recommend that you download the software provided (free) by HiSeeU. It is under the downloads under downlod#3 called “PC Client for Wireless security camera system”. It works well but I have not been able to do configurations with it yet.So far, we have had rain, snow and subfreezing weather and the cameras have held up nice. I did place one camera under a heat lamp for 12 hours and this camera worked well too.So far to date: (20190103) here are the pros and cons:Pro:• Price• Tech Support• Simple to set up• Compact• Built in range extension• Free cloud access• Functional app• Free MAC/PC software• Built-in linking (extensions)• E-Mail and app notifications work well and easy to configureCons:• Short RF range (can be overcome with extensions)• Instructions (online and paper provided) This could be corrected with up to date language and pictures.• Power supplies. I have used these same ones on other systems and they only last about 6 to 12 months in the heat of AZ• Reset button cap. It is poorly made and makes it easy to accidently hit the reset of the camera. Added silicon to button so as to not hit the button and also keep water proof.• No on/off switch on NVR• Only one USB on NVR. If you want to export a video on the NVR you can not as you need the USB port for the mouse. This also can be overcome by using the PC software which allows you to export to the PC.• No ability to connect to existing network wirelessly. Can only connect to router via RF45.• Ethernet port is on 10/100 and does not support 1000 MbUPDATED 20200518This is now the fourth set of these camera and NVR that I have purchased. I installed my first one here on Roatan off the coast of Honduras in our beach home. It has worked flawlessly now for over a month. I installed a 4TB drive and with all cameras recording all the time plus motion as well as activity logs, I get well over 6 months of recording for the 4 cameras.The cameras have held up well to the harsh monsoon season where we get Nor’easters’ rains as well as sea spray hitting the cameras. I did spray the outside of the cameras with a silicon-based spray prior to install and every 6 months just to make sure there are now issues. I also utilize the range extender ( ASIN B07NRBYM5C) that they offer, yes it is cheap plastic and the current software of the NVR will only allow 2 cameras and yes it does induce a lag in the picture but it always works flawlessly even with all the power outages we have here on the island. Always comes right back up when power is restored.I have only had one issue with a camera that had stopped working and I could not bring it back to life, after a quick email to the support folks that answered back the next day with some ideas. Low and behold what they had recommended fixed it and brought it back to life. Every time I have contacted customer support with questions about the product, they have been fantastic and better than the folks at the “other” companies (ARLO).I have shown off my set up and the fact that I can monitor for anywhere in the world several of my friends have asked me to order one and install for them (For a beer or two) which I have been happy to do. Not many products I have been this happy with.I do wish they would update the NVR software soon as there are still some issues with the connection to a higher end 4k TV but it is a simple fix with adjustment of the resolution once you figure it out (through great tech support).Some cons:The newer cameras do not have the reset button on the cable and now include the power and RJ-45 connector. The cord is also a bit shorter but I mount mine on grey electrical boxes to stash the cords and power connections so not a big deal but do miss the reset button.The power cord for the NVR is short, really short.There is no ON/OFF switch on the NVR so you have to pull the short power cable to turn it off.Bottom line:Getting ready to order 3 more sets here. I have been so happy with this set as it is great value for the $$$. Oh, and yes, this is the same NVR device as so many others sell for a lot more.","I am happy with this basic NVR wireless cam system; it is what I was looking for under a tight budget.I decided to purchase the: HisEEu 4-Channel HD 1080P Wireless Security Camera System (Wireless NVR Kits),4Pcs 960P 1.3MP IP Security Camera Wireless Indoor/Outdoor IR Bullet IP Cameras Wi-Fi, P2P,App, NO Hard DriveThe system option that I ordered was the one that comes without a hard drive ASIN: B07FSFXZZ3, Item model number: WNKIT-4HB611AThe reason that I decided to go without a hard drive was that besides going on a tight budget, I also have a 500GB hard drive, that I pulled out of a portable hard enclosure that I hardly used before it went inside a box for about three years. For all purposes is a new HDD. One of the things that I liked about this NVR is that it came with the screws, the power cable and the SATA cable for the HDD, so I didn’t have to buy those. Installing the HDD was a breeze, and I did not have any complications with it.Before I installed the cameras in the chosen locations, I connected the NVR, and I downloaded the latest firmware, after that, I connected each one of the cameras to their power supply and verified that they were working with the NVR.Do not embellish your installation, do not wrap the cables with nice tie bands, or place the NVR unit in a difficult location until you have everything working right.I knew that I would have an issue with two of the cameras before I installed them, and that is because the location (backyard lanai) of the cameras it’s a place were my WIFI signal was very poor until I installed a WIFI extender. So, before you install your cameras, I suggest you download on your smartphone or tablet an app called WIFI manager I have the one from kmasoft. It will provide you with information on the signal strength of your WIFI, and you could use it to get an idea what kind of signal the cameras will get from the NVR system (assuming you will have the NVR in the same location as the WIFI router). The NVR provides its own IP address to the cameras; the cameras will not be using the IP address supplied by your WIFI router, the NVR will obtain an IP address from the router, that what will allow you to see the cameras over the internet.Can the cameras work directly with the router? Technically it is possible; it will not be an issue with the cameras that have an ethernet cable, with the push button cameras it will be a more difficult task. However, why would you like to complicate the whole thing? Leave the router alone.In my router, each one of my devices has it own IP address reservation, that way I do not find my devices jumping from one IP to another, which sometimes ends in address conflicts, and erratic connections.After I installed the cameras, I found one of them connecting and disconnecting, and the other one jumping frames. I went through all recommendations such as antenna orientation and so on, but it didn’t help much.So, I ordered the Wi-Fi Range Extender for hisEEu Security Camera System Wireless. ASIN: B07FY81P8X,Item model number: IPC RouterAn unexepected add on that cost me $20, there goes my budget for the cameras.Unfortunately, the wireless extender comes with instructions for the ethernet cable cameras, and I have the push button cameras. After some pain and suffering, I had the extender up and running. The extender works, and it solved the poor signal problem that I had with the cameras in the backyard, the other two front door cameras are very close to the NVR, so I never have an issue with either one.All four cameras are under covered porches so that they will have no issues with the rain. They will be exposed to the heat and high humidity of Central Florida, but that will be it. Regardless of the claims of any manufacturer about the weather rating for the cameras; you should never expose them to direct rain. The issue is that the cameras run slightly warm, and when they are splashed with water the air inside of the cameras will suddenly cool down, and it will create a slight vacuum pulling in the outdoor humidity with time. I understand that sometimes you have no choice with regards to the location, however, do your best to shield them from the direct heavy rain.WORD OF ADVICE. Never, ever push the button of the cameras, do not play with it, no matter how intrigued you are, do not press that button for any reason, not even if you think that the instructions tell you to do so. NO TOUCHY! You will regret it.A long press of that bottom will reset the IP address, and the short press will allow you to pair them again. When you reset the camera IP address, the chances are that the new IP address will not match the one stored in the NVR, you will need to erase the one saved, and go through the matching procedure to make them work again.So, if your curiosity ended with no cameras being recognized, you will have to remove them from the location, take a seat in front of the TV and the NVR with the cameras connected to their power supply, make sure you have the latest firmware installed in the NVR and that it is connected to the WI-FI router. Once you are comfortable, you can start fixing the problem, which will include disconnecting the cameras from the NVR on the OS screen, then cover the camera lens, press the diabolic button, and disconnect the power. While you are holding the camera, connect the camera to the power supply, release the diabolic button, uncover the camera, it will make a little noise, it will reset and show in the NVR OS screen.If you don’t want to do all of that, do not touch the button on the cameras, or the IP setting of the cameras on the NVR OS screen.The instructions that come with the extender are perfect for making your life miserable, as they do not apply for the push button cameras, pressing the button of the extender and waiting for it to pair, will not happen, and that is why I ended touching the diabolic button on the camera and hell broke loose. The manufacturer posted a video on YouTube on how to set up the extender with push button cameras.The whole pairing thing of the extender and the cameras can be done in the NVR OS screen without pressing any buttons either in the cameras or the extender. Although while on the menu from the extender you will have to do it once to code match the extender with the NVR.Videos:ZOSI - How to set up the NVR repeaters to boost the Wi-Fi distance?Hiseeu wireless NVR kit match code (No LAN port)Very technical videos in YouTube channel: BehforHow complicated is to set up this NVR system? Well if you are the person that only sets up their devices with the router push button, and don’t know anything about IP addresses, or router OS setup, then this will not be that easy.Yes, you will be able to get out of the box, follow the questions in the screen for the setup, and make it run. However, if you touch any of the settings, and change the values, you will have a hell of a time. There is no built-in help in the NVR OS as you will find in your windows PC. Your best bet for technical support will always be YouTube videos.This brand is as good as any other with the same product, after all, it comes from the same factory. However, their technical support varies on available YouTube videos. My current firmware is not the one that shows in the videos, but if you know what you are doing, that is that not that much important.Things that I did not like, is that to back up a video, it has to be done through the single USB port in the back unit, one has to disconnect the mouse and then insert a USB memory device. One extra USB in the front of the unit would have been useful. However, in my case, I am not expecting to have to do so at any time.The push button cameras are good; although, I prefer the ones with the ethernet cable, which would have to give me the option to connect and reset the cameras directly to the NVR or my PC. However, it is not a big deal, if you do not mess with the camera button, and if you have the system up and running, you will never need an ethernet cable on the cameras.The camera system that I ordered is four channels, what that means is that only four cameras can work with the system, I will not be able to upgrade and install more cameras later on.If you don’t like the order in which each camera is laid out in the screen, you can click hold and drag them to a different position on the screen.Manual recording allows you to set up with an easy click one or all cameras to record 24/7; then you don’t need to go through the scheduler.How many GB does the NVR use while recording 24 Hrs? It depends on what is being recorded, in my home, the cameras are recording the back and front yards doors. The traffic in the area is what you will typically have in a house, as the images are mostly static (few people in and out). I am using about 25-30 GB every 24 hours, so that means that my net HDD 465 GB (after formatting ) will be able to record a minimum of 15 days of 24 Hours videos. For my needs that's is enough, although if the HDD fails one day, I will upgrade it to a larger one. Also, remember these are 1.3MP cameras, higher resolution cameras will use more GB of space in the HDD.There Is no need to install the CMS software for watching the cameras in a PC, If your PC is in the same network as the NVR, just type in your browser the IP address of the NVR, and the cameras will be visible.Remember to set up a password for the NVR. Otherwise, your cameras and the NVR OS will be visible and accessible to anyone in your network.I highly recommend that you visit the manufacturers YouTube channel and watch a few videos before you embark in the installation of your NVR system.I rate this product 5 stars, it works well, the price is right, and the resolution of the camera is very good for the distance that I need it to cover. It is easy to install; however, you must be able to understand the OS of the NVR.The day resolution of the camera is good enough for identification of a person in front of the door or a car parked in the driveway, but it will not allow you to get the tag of a vehicle moving on the street.The infrared (night recording in B&W) is decent but is only effective for close takes such recording a person in front of your door in the middle of the night. If you have a bright light in the location, the camera will switch back to color mode, and the quality of the picture will be even better.The IP Pro3 app for Android devices in straight forwards, set up its easy, I did not find complications with it. Connectivity issues will be the combination of your phone LTE signal and your internet connection signal for the NVR; you can expect some jumping frames and time delay. However, that is considered normal, except if you have the security system and the internet connectivity that a large corporation can afford.Wireless NVR cameras systems have come a long way. They are easy to install, and they beat climbing on the attic and walk over the insulation to install wiring. However, wireless NVR is a compromise that allows you to connect the system a few hours with minimum work, but at the cost of sometimes having to deal with signal issues.Which brand should you buy? Indeed Amazon reviews are helpful, but sometimes some bad reviews are posted by people who do not have enough technical knowledge to solve a problem. I previously mentioned that many of these brands/systems come from one manufacturing plant in China. When you measure the technical support that you receive because of a phone number or an email address you are doing it wrong. Enter in their websites and look at what kind of information they have available; can you download manuals? Do they have a section of FAQ? Then check to see if they have YouTube videos of the unit that you are buying, YouTube videos will be your primary source of technical support for NVR systems, issues with the equipment can sometimes be too complicated for you to resolve with an email or a phone call, a video it’s the perfect walkthrough.Product support from HisEEu via YouTube videos is very decent. However, the manufacturer still has some work to do in that area. Their YouTube is channel: c hiseeuI contacted technical support via email, and they were very helpful.The last tip. Buy a UPS where you can connect the NVR, the router, and the modem. It will be one of the best decision you can make. It is essential for the NVR as the HDD will not be affected during power failures. Also if you want to maximize your security, then also install a UPS for the cameras as they will keep recording during a power failure, it takes about 20 seconds for the cameras to reconnect with the NVR after a power failure. I may do it for the front cameras as I have an old UPS laying around.I hope that you find the review useful.","For the price $150, nvr with 4 wi-fi outdoor cameras, expandable to 8, very good picture, very good wi-fi signal connection, easy to use. Buy this product. Just a little problem in setting it up. Phone call to them could have been avoided if they have better instruction in the manual. Phone call was helpful and friendly, but they hardly speak English. Have to repeat 10 times, they still don’t understand. Do not install cameras until they are all paired wit nvr and you can see pictures. Connect nvr to router with supplied Ethernet Cale by connecting nvr to router with Ethernet cable. Turn on nvr and cameras, they will auto pair. Everything perfect so far. Up to this point, you can stop if you do not want smart connection since it’s up and running.For smart phone access, you download ip-pro from the App Store free. You have to add just one device, it is the nvr. Do not try to add cameras because the 4 cameras are part of the nvr system. The manual does not say this. Now comes the tricky part that I have to call them for help. They list work time 5-9pm Pacific time, night banker’s hour? On the add device screen, you need to input 3 pieces of info: cloud ID, user name defaults to admin (leave this alone), password for admin. Admin is administrator on the nvr set up earlier.One star deducted for bad manual instruction. Otherwise, I want to give it 5 stars.Update: Upgrade to 5 stars today because of the following. The system has been running smoothly for 3 months since new. I use the IP Pro app on my iPhone an IPad, and my wife runs it on her iPhone. But starting 2 weeks ago, the IP Pro app fail to load. It will load and flash for a second and then closes. I called customer service a few moments ago. They are very helpful and friendly. The gentleman told me to download the the most up to date version 3.2.4. I did just that, and the problem was resolved. Thank you, Hiseeu. I feel safer now that I can monitor the surrounding of my house again.","This was a purchase on prime day July 16 2019 as the price dropped from $169 to $129. With another discount already applied by amazon and an 8% code offered by the seller... I paid $119 for this system.Only bought it for the cameras to add to my existing 8ch system. Cameras are $44/ea. Kind of a no brainer. I did install my own red wd 1tb HDD and tested the whole system. All worked just fine. Bought the 4 camera system without the hdd. Upon arrival I assembled everything on my dining room table, all was good. I installed the camera's and my own HDD in the NVR. Also got the NVR connected to my tv. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the picture was for each camera. Now waiting for nightfall to see how good the IR would be. Again.. very pleased! The system management takes some tinkering to get used to. The motion detection will drive you crazy at night if your using the app and have notifications on.... if the sensitivity is set too high as the bugs like the light/heat from the cameras.Yes each camera has to be plugged in to an outlet but no other wires are necessary for the cameras themselves.Overall here are my ratings.Picture. 4.8/5. Zoom could be better, gets grainy.Motion. 4.5/5. It definitely works. Find the happy place. I havent yet.Night IR. 5/5. Honestly no complaints, works well.System interface. 4.5/5. Now I have not messed with everything but what I have it's pretty simple once you understand.Customer service. 5/5. Fast response. Pretty sure they are located in China, 12 hours ahead of my time zone so when I emailed it was 130am making it afternoon there. Either way, great friendly customer service.Overall. 5/5. Good quality for the price!",I bought in the system in May 2019. I’m very pleased. Great pictures night and day. VERY EASY installation. I will be adding another camera with two way talk ability for the front door. Very good quality. I work nights so we have it hooked up to our bedroom TV. If the the wife hears a noise she wakes up looks at the TV to see what it is. She feels safe since I bought this system. Only thing I would do different is buy the one with the hard drive. Cause I had to buy it separate and install myself. Which was very easy for someone without electronic knowledge. App on phone works great. There is an email for questions johnny@hiseeu.com. They answered me within 15mins. I strongly recommend. (Didn’t give motion detection any stars cause I don’t want use it so I can’t give a rating),785,262,https://www.amazon.com/Spotlight%E3%80%91-Wire-Free-Hiseeu-Waterproof-Spotlight/dp/B097TFQYXF/ref=sr_1_22_sspa?keywords=outdoor+battery+powered+security+camera+with+smartphone+app&qid=1640229862&sr=8-22-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzMVBaT1hKUUoxNk1PJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDQyOTA2MVhXSVMxV1VCMDlWUCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjE5Mjc5WElSQlEzS0Q5WUVHJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYnRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

It has been totally re-engineered. Take it from someone who owns all the different cameras Blink had to offer since day one and had to get on a waiting list to get the very first one. So, I should know what iam talking about. This new camera no longer has the push down and pull system to open the back to install batteries. It has a large screw that you simply unscrew with a included tool to open the back of the camera which is really nice. Once you open the back and install the included batteries scan the small QR code inside the camera threw the blink app it will scan to find the camera once that is done it will automatically do a firmware update. After that you are ready to install your new blink camera. Also noticed the sound is much louder and more clear then the other cameras. This is good if two people are talking in a low voice you can hear what they are saying. Has brighter clearer night vision. Nice clear voice communication with two way talk. Alot stronger wifi signal to sink module and from sink module to camera. Sharp, clear, bright, and colorful HD vision during the day. I noticed before I wrote this review that some people only gave this camera 2 or 3 stars. Like the guy who is complaining about software issues. Well if you follow the directions you would not have that problem. Let the camera finish its firmware update. Duh ! Also, if you have been a Blink customer for a while and want to add this camera to your current system. You do not have to pay for cloud storage you are grandfathered in. After you add this camera to your existing system it will actually tell you this ! The front of the camera has a all new face with a very smooth and shinny surface iam sure to help combat the weather and give it a more high tec look. Their is no longer a switch inside the camera to turn on or off the blue recording light located on the front of the camera. It's is all done threw the app which is really nice as well. They really did a good job in re-engineering this camera and listened to customer complaints about their past cameras and went threw and fixed every issue. I would definitely buy this camera again ! UPDATE : 09-25-20 After using this camera for a couple of days. And as other reviewers have noted that this camera only has a 25 foot motion trigger ! Anything further than 25 feet it will NOT record when motion is present. So if you need a camera get the Blink XT2 for the further range. This camera will only be good for specific areas like door or window that are within the 20 to 25 foot range from the camera.","It's super easy. Works great. Setup was simple. It works exactly as advertised. What I didn't know for sure is that the batteries are just high quality AA batteries. So when they die, you can get some rechargeable ones and just rotate them through the thing. I'm going to order a couple more. They are pretty great. *Edit-A nice person took the time to let me know it's best not to replace w/ traditional AA batteries.","So far everything is as advertised. Setup was a breeze and the image quality is great - especially when set to “best.” I really appreciate the custom activity zones that you can set, as well as the ability the turn off the led light.In terms of improvement, the included mount is pretty basic. For better or worse the mount snaps into the back of the camera module. This makes installing it relatively easy, but also means anyone could detach it with a firm pull. I’ve noticed that there are upgraded mounts that you buy, but haven’t had a chance to fully check those out yet.Lastly, I noticed another reviewer mentioned subscription pricing, but it’s a bit misleading. Yes, there is cloud storage that you can pay for, but there are multiple levels, including a free plan, as well as a basic plan for $3/month. Also, the paid plans don’t start until 2021. More importantly, What this camera has, that the XT2 doesn’t, is local storage. If you’re big on privacy, and don't want to store videos on the cloud, you can attach a USB drive to the blink module and save your videos there (see photo which shows the usb drive). There’s no fee for saving your videos locally - you can still get alerts and watch your video feed live for free.",What an awesome product...total install took 25 minutes. I put 3 camera’s up outside to monitor my summer home. One of the camera’s I places on a pole in the yard pointing at the roof so I can monitor snow fall and snow melt roof system. The app was friendly. I shared the app with my wife and she was up and running in 2 minutes with minimal effort. We are so happy with this wireless system.,88175,4,https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Outdoor-Wireless-Security-Camera/dp/B086DKSYTS/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=outdoor+battery+powered+security+camera+with+smartphone+app&qid=1640229862&sr=8-13

Zumimall constantly updates and upgrades and I always worried about getting surveillance with legacy software but they constantly update their app more than Apple would do software updates. Which is a good thing.Can't recommend this camera and support this kind of company, help them with your feedback and watch them actually implement certain features. I've bought probably over 10 units from them of different models over 5 years and have given them out as gifts to friends and family because this company creates products ahead of the market at an affordable price. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, support companies like this! Where the engineering team actually cares about building better products that consumers want, they are the leaders in this market. Thanks ZumiMall",,"I've tried other battery cams and none had the field of vision I'm able to get with this camera.Pros:*Clear night vision*Almost 360 degree field of vision*Rapid alerts*Camera does respond quickly, no problems opening the app to view alerts*Field of vision at least 55 feet during the day with perfect 1080p*Strong WiFi readings with 2 external antennas, even mounted up in a tree*Easy to install yourself with back plate using only 4 screws. Side screws are applied by hand to remove unit only for charging*Best battery life of any camera I've tested.Cons:*It is a bit heavy due to the large battery, but the back plate is small enough for installation on a medium branch*The app doesn't automatically record videos, you still must manually record the alerts to save. This is an easy fix by the app developer, so shouldn't discourage the choice of this greatly upgraded pan cam.It blends into the environment once we installed the unit. We've finally got coverage over our entire yard plus all the surrounding properties, from just one unit. Highly recommend!","I wanted a wireless security camera with excellent signal strength since the camera is located pretty far from my wireless router. Previous cameras would only work intermittently, but this new Zumimall Pan Tilt Security Camera was just what I needed! It has a strong signal, was simple to install and has a clear picture that is easy to adjust on my Android Smart Phone. It is too soon to test the full battery life, but the unit is solidly built so I'm not expecting any issues. Very pleased!","After purchasing several types of stationary wireless cameras over the years I decided to try a security camera with more features. There are literally dozens of models from different manufacturers available. I had purchased some Zumimall cameras before and was impressed with their quality, affordability and their outstanding customer service. This is also a total wireless camera but it has a 15000 Mah rechargeable battery, which is one of the most powerful batteries I have seen available on a wireless camera, and can give up to 6 months before recharging is necessary. I installed mine with a Zumimall solar charger. Living in South Florida, i get plenty of sunshine so I never have to worry about recharging batteries.The pan/tilt feature is great. It can pan almost 360 degrees and tilt 180 degrees. This allows it to view the entire front lawn, for example, with just the one camera. It uses an app developed by Zumimall (Android or Apple). This app allows you to control all functions of the camera with easy to understand simple instructions. And unlike other brand camera apps I have tried in the past, this app has no glitches, is stable and actually works. This camera is very well designed, engineered and is of very high quality. Setup is easy and took 5 minutes. As I mentioned it is also priced at a price about half of some cameras I have tried with much less build quality. I have it installed (Photo included) in the overhead ceiling of my carport facing my front door and mail box. I have a very bright front door LED light and the night vision is in color and of excellent definition. I also installed a 128 GB SD card in the camera which stores a vast quantity of recorded videos for later review. The mic and speaker work exceptionally well, compared to some other more expensive cameras I have tried. It has a great WiFi receiver as well. Even through 4 walls of my concrete block home the average WiFi signal strength at the camera is 75%. All in all I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it. The only thing I feel could improve the system would be to develop a charging cable with an enclosed watertight boot to protect it against moisture if installing outdoors. ( Such as the one on the charging cable of the A-3 camera.)You will not be disappointed with this camera.",483,213,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Wireless-Surveillance-Waterproof-Encrypted/dp/B08TM9TBTW/ref=sr_1_12_sspa?keywords=outdoor+battery+powered+security+camera+with+smartphone+app&qid=1640229862&sr=8-12-spons&psc=1&smid=A18WB0Y2K9O5GH&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzMVBaT1hKUUoxNk1PJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDQyOTA2MVhXSVMxV1VCMDlWUCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDgwNjg3MzVDRzZPMDRUODNVMiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

I don't know why some people say that it only records with motion. If they read or have some type of knowledge,you can change the settings to record all the time..also you can view it on all devices live and recorded... the best easy to use systems...",This camera security system is amazing and the video is so clear and the clarity is beyond amazing. The HD quality of the pictures that you get from the cameras are unbelievable you can pick up somebody's license plates and their faces. The lens surface may look small but the amount of space in panoramic view you get is large. To hook it up to your smartphone is super easy. The only problem I have encountered is trying to hook it up to my computer. Night Owl has been great with trying to help me work on this. Other than that this camera system is beyond amazing and the clarity of the pictures and quality of the video you will get is astonishing. The audio is amazing on the two audio cameras that you get with the set you can clearly hear if someone makes a comment or say something. If you're looking to update your security camera system I would definitely recommend you buy this camera security system.,"I had this camera system professional installed, all around, and inside of my home. I use 2 cams indoor, and 6 outdoor. The outdoor cameras are very durable (I live in Michigan where the weather varies from very hot, to extremely cold; plus severe storms are the norm)! I haven't had any trouble seeing what's going on outdoors, or inside, when I'm home watching on the big monitor (not included), or away on my tablet of cellphones (I use both iPhone and Galaxy S android phones). I really don't have any complaints, and have been very happy with the equipment. The management interface is a little dated, but it's just a camera system, so it's very functional and easy to use. The on-device playback system has improved over the past year, with firmware updates, and is straightforward to use! The mobile app playback is still a little clunky, but I'm hopeful it will improve once they update the apps. Anyway, I highly recommend this camera system, and will buy it again, whenever I move!","I had a first gen Night Owl system that quit working after 5 years so I decided to upgrade to a HD system. I have to say I am impressed with the system in whole. It was easy to set up and the streaming to smartphone worked easily and extremely well once port forwarding was set up. The app is very intuitive allowing for capture of snapshot or video file. The cameras are awesome and correlate movement with IR and display events as a yellow block on a timeline for easy review. the video quality is really sharp and the night vision mode really reaches out so much better than the older 720p cameras I had. The documentation is spotty at best and It took awhile to learn how to search and find events, but once figured it out it's really cool and easy to find things that set the system to record or send an alarm. I am very happy with the system, will see how it holds up.",Great system. But each camera needs WiFi. So with 10 cameras 4 smart TVs 5cable boxes 2 smart phones fire stick and an I pad all on one WiFi with upgraded 150 speed it’s picture is delayed or pauses a bit.

It isn’t available in EU yet, so I bit the bullet and shipped it international.Remote people have instantly commented on dramatic improvement in meetings... as you can probably expect. Several day trip meetings are now been postponed to “Owl It”. Quality is very good, so I can comment on how much this Pro version is versus the earlier one. I use Skype and MS Teams.I do want to add a note about the case. It is a shame that Owl Labs don’t have a convenient case that comes with it. This isn’t the sort of hardware you want lying loose in a bag during transit.I did discover that most Oculus Rift VR carry cases available on Amazon are an excellent dimension to fit he Owl (Pro or Regular) in with its power supplies and cables. I attached some photos of one Oculus Rift case I ordered. I cut the foam out and glued in some new foam to match the Owl. Works like a charm. I now can carry it separately to meetings or throw the case inside my larger everyday backpack. I just wish Owl Labs did include a case, even if it was an additional purchase option.I honestly cant fault this for much, since there really isn’t anything else in the industry quite like it at the moment.","I purchased the Meeting Owl Pro to make joining meetings a more interactive experience for remote users than just a speaker alone. So far, I have found this product extremely easy to set up and use. I have been told that the sound and video quality of meetings have been wonderful, and users have really enjoyed being able to feel more a part of meetings they are unable to attend in person.I do not keep my Owl in one location; rather, I travel to client locations and set up the owl so that my team members and others can join the meeting. I've had no issues setting it up each time. It is quick and easy through the app. I use GoToMeeting to run the meetings, which the Owl also very easily works with. I do wish there was a carrying case I could purchase for my needs, as I usually end up packing the Owl in a checked bag when traveling.If you're looking for a way to close the gap between your virtual and in person meeting attendees, I cannot recommend this product enough. It delivers exactly what is promised.","We've tried many different devices for our home office and finally found a devices that seamlessly handles both video and audio in our space. The Owl Pro is that device. Easy connection and setup for all of our users, who vary in levels of technical skill.The only draw back is our meetings now take a couple of minutes longer since everyone wants to know why our camera image is different and that leads to them wanting to know about the Owl Pro.","The Owl Pro will cover up to 15ft distance on all sides when placed in the middle of a conference table. . We love how this camera focuses in on the speaker and yet still can zoom in on others sitting within a 15 distance. For those who are joining the team via zoom, they can see each individual as though they were sitting in front of their laptops but yet in a good distance that is comfortable for everyone, even those who are more shy and don't want to be in the limelight. :-) The voice and picture are clear and for us, it seems to be the next best thing to meeting in person. Very nice camera and a good investment for a team of people that can fill a table 15 ft from the camera.","This has been one of the best investments that we have made, to date, in our vitural counseling, outreach, and teletherapy protocols. It puts the person, on the other end, in the room with you. It unites the group in a way that only Owl can. We would never have thought this was even possible, but it far outperformed our expectations. We got the PRO and recommend it. The spiffs are worth the extra and now we are purchasing two more. I stepped out on a limb with this thing to begin with and now we are buying more.

With the new indoor cam I can now access all my cams from one app. To me the picture quality is great overall and especially in total darkness. Live view connection is a lot more stable than my Wyze cams. Alexa integration is a big plus, no need for third party hacks to complete routines. Because I already have Ring cameras it’s worth it to pay a little more over a Wyze cam.","In February, I noticed my ADHD medication ran out early. I’m very careful about taking it exactly as prescribed so it was strange that I had run out 10 days early. For reasons I won’t get into for this review, I suspected the property manager of my building was stealing it. Obviously that sounded crazy, but I couldn’t think of another explanation. A friend suggested a Ring camera, so I bought one never expecting anything to actually come of it. I put some antihistamines in my now empty pill bottle thinking no one would ever take them, set up the camera when it arrived, and felt more secure knowing it was there. Set up was simple so I figured worst case scenario, I was out a bit of money and I spent maybe 10 minutes setting it up.Fast forward a week later when I get a notification via the app that there was motion detected on my camera. I open up the recording and there she is, entering my apartment, going right for my decoy pills, taking them, and leaving. I immediately left work to get back home. I called the police who sent an officer. I showed him the video and he admitted that had I not had the video, he wouldn’t have believed me. I was able to quickly and easily send the video to the police and to the president of the company that owns my building. I also was able to download the video and get it uploaded so that I have copies of it as I go through the next few months as she (hopefully) gets brought to justice.I cannot emphasize how much this little camera has helped me. I would not have caught my burglar otherwise. Because of it, they were able to look up records of who used their electronic key to access my apartment and she had been in there 7 times over the month prior. This would have gone on for longer and who knows if it would have resulted in harm to myself or my cat had I not caught her. This camera has given some of the sense of security she stole from me back and stopped a nightmare situation from worsening. I will still be recovering from this for long time and I am hoping she is brought to justice, but I cannot thank Ring enough for helping me secure my home from an unexpected source of danger.","This camera for $60 is a solid deal.

Well everything is set up now and running great! I did have a similar problem with this system as far as the 2nd floor rear camera getting a weaker signal but not as severe, the signal is 3 bars out of 4 which slightly takes away from the quality the camera records and displays at so I used the wired 6 foot antenna and hooked it up to the camera outside & sat the antenna on a dresser on the 2nd floor & the camera gets a much stronger signal now always displaying decent quality with -1 bar - full bars & there is never a missed second or drop out which is why I really like this set, I also want to note that the rear 2nd floor camera has a brick wall in between the home and the camera, I also have a camera mounted in the front of the house beyond a brick wall but that gets a full signal and is very clear just like the one located inside the home. I still occasionally get -1 bar on the signal leading to a slightly reduced quality on the 2nd floor rear camera but it never cuts out or misses a second. The NVR is packed with features and the mobile app is convenient and I love being able to monitor my home remotely while at work, the motion detection has a lot of customization which is nice since you can choose which areas to detect the motion & the sensitivity, also you can fiddle with the channel the wireless system operates on which may help the signal but I have not had time to get into that yet. I am very glad they included the 1 wired antenna so I could get the great picture I am getting on the 2nd floor rear camera because without it the signal was nearly poor quality, you may want to check the signal before sealing around the cameras to see if you may need to also use a wired antenna that is positioned inside but hooked into the outside camera, I did find they are sold on Amazon in case you need more then the 1 included with this set.The cameras are already synced with the NVR so there is no customization needed on the cameras, all you have to do is boot them up and you are good to go! The night vision is okay and easy enough to distinguish a face and figure of something but not from too far away. Overall I am satisfied with the cameras, the attached pictures are night time and it is very dark in the rear pictures, daytime video is very clear! I am attaching a picture of the motion activated rear camera earlier this morning, it is very clear!","I purchased these after trying out Xfinity home security system. Thank goodness they have a 30 day money back guarantee. Their night vision is useless!! Night Owl camera's are awesome. I had the Xfinity tech watch their video and the night owl - they were amazed. Plus Night Owl's camera system is cheaper and there are no monthly fee's!! I am a 62 yr old female and I was able to set up and install my own system. Just remember to ""pair"" your cameras with the NVR ""before"" you take them out and install them. 😀","I was concerned about purchasing system after reading reviews. I had a home consultant come out and he advised upgrading my Wi-Fi. Did that ordered the system, had to reset the cameras. (I did hold for 40 minutes til tech support got on with me walked me through it. Everything has worked great since. Great clarity phone app works great and I am pleased with the purchase.","I installed this in a dealership and it did exactly what I needed it too... motion sensor is great, 2 way audio is a bit laggy ( about 5 sec behind) image quality is great. I can easily zoom in or out as I wish. Set up was easy and install was easy as well. If you install the NVR behind a wall, don’t expect to reach the 100ft signal advertise ... no way it will. But dealership has glass windows and it worked perfectly. The night owl x app is user friendly. Easy set up... does what it’s needed to do.",Easy to install and works well. Sometimes I have a problem connecting using the mobile app but for the most part it does what you expect. I especially like the fact that the device stores video.

Love the system which was easy to install and get up and running. Quality is top notch as picture quality surprised me in a very good way.,"UPDATE July 2021] So everything is still working fine except for 1 camera is foggy. Only 2 cameras are directly in the rain, one now gets foggy, it's been foggy for at least 6 months already, so it was only in the rain for less than a year (I bought these December '19). I tried to clean it, but it was clean, but I could clearly see water drops behind the lens. I'm buying Honic 100-130 night vision with WDR that totally eliminates blowout. I bought one, and it's awesome, so I'm buying anothre ot replace the foggy camera. This is a great starter set because you get the DVR and lot's of cameras. Then you can replace or add really nice cameras to your setup. It owuld not be fair to compare these SMONET cameras to the HONIC. They are $53 each, so for 8 of them that would be $424 + DVR + hard drive.Manual Zoom would really help these 'get closr to the ground' and WDR would really help prevent blowout. Stronger IR blasters woudl help light up the ground/room for the night vision. But again, all of it is ""good enough"", and for houses, where you are probably gong to mount these closer to the ground,a dn have less to light up, it's fine. You can get IR flood lights to help, and since the DVR is 16 chanel, you can buy a PTZ camera and 7 WDR manual zoom cameras, and have no waste.[January 2020]They really pull in color much better than our old ones. This allows for more blowout with shadows vs the sun, but overall it looks much better. The DVR had weird color settings out of the box making the blowout worse. I moved everything to 50%, and it looks good. If anyone walks in frame, you can see them very well.Also, these only have 3 LED's, so the night mode is not very impressive lighting up the ground. BUT, I tested it, and if someone walks into frame, the LED's are strong enough to light them up.They have a bit of fisheye on the edges, but it's probably a good compromise. The distortion is very minimal in the middle, but these hit a much bigger area than our old cameras.I was worried about the 'lid' to keep the rain off because it's not adjustable and doesn't hang over the lens very far. But I'm really pleased that no rain, snow, sleet, fog have gotten on the lens. And we have experienced all of that in the first month of having them. The pictures have remained really clear Our last ones would fog up from time to time. 2 tips:1. Do not connect these to your old power supply. I fried 2 of them, thinking the first one was a dud. The power supply was different, so we had to use the included power supplies.2. Email the email address in the instructions for the PC application, and ask for the one that is not Denali. Denali works great for your phone, but on the PC you can only view 4 cameras at once. The other program they sent (after I complained) lets you see all of them at once.1.b. If you have a multi-monitor setup, then move the program to the screen you want, then hover over the icon on your taskbar, right-click on the preview, and click maximize. That will allow you to maximize the window on the correct screen. Using the built-in maximize button will fullscreen on your main monitor, not the monitor you have the window on.If you want to be fancy, and add a camera that can move around, I added this camera to the DVR and it works great:SUNBA Outdoor PTZ Camera with RS485 Control (405-22X)After fiddling around with the settings a bunch and replugging everything in, I restarted the DVR, and it just worked!If you want better software, and more 'moving' cameras I think IP cameras are probably a better choice. But I have never bought that type and set it up. I have BNC coaxial cables running everywhere already.","Product is easy to install, compatible with my existing cameras. Haven't heard back from company why it needs my Gmail password to send messages. Or why Gmail says it's a danger and won't let it log in. Signed up for cloud backup and haven't see any recorded video. Half the time it says no recorded video on device then the other half I can play back remote. It took a while to get together because of the time difference but after getting together she was very helpful and problem is resolved.",I bought the security system to replace an old outdated system that I was currently using from another brand. I was able to use my original wiring and connected the new cameras to the wires and new DVR. I could not believe how vivid the color was and how well it picked up images in the dark and farther then my old camera system. I had one power source that to be replaced. With no fault of the system. Marvin at tech support asked if I would order another power source from Amazon and they would reimburse me for the cost. I ordered and received the power source and Marvin immediately contacted amazon to credit the money to my account. I am recommending this camera system to my friends and have no reservations that it is the best you can get for the money spent! A great investment. I give their customer support high rating for caring and acting quickly to resolve the minor issue.,"This is perfect for our little retail business...can see what's happening indoors and outdoors when we're not there. I gave one less star because, not having knowledge about how any of this works, it wasn't exactly ""easy"" for me to install (after my husband did the dirty work of threading wires through the crawl-space and attic).

The only negative thing I found was the NVR didn't have a remote so your force to the mouse to change selected camera.The installation went pretty easy other than routing the cable in the attic in difficult to reach location. Being a Technician I was able to install the cameras in the optimal location and fished cable in the wall to my entertainment center. Anyone not mechanically incline should hire someone to run the wires if you don't wires showing or wall fished.The setup of the cameras is very straight forward, follow the on-screen setup wizard and your done in 10 minutes.Tips:The weather boot protecting the ethernet connection to the camera is about 7/8 wide which means you'll need a 7/8 bit or a hole saw to route the cable in the attic or wall unless the cable entry is more than 12 inches away from the camera.One of my cameras is 120Ft away from the NVR so I ran my own ethernet cable and removed the weather boot from the provided cable and placed it on my cable before installing the connector. Worked perfectly.The last tip is having a second person makes the installation much easier. But if your doing it alone have the app installed and use that to help you adjust the camera angle.","I was going on a trip and we needed to monitor the business while away.

I went with the wired system becauseif you have to run a power cord for the wireless then why not get a wired system & have camers w/more then twice the megapixels also with being a POE system you only run 1 cord just like you would for the wireless & the wireless range is about the same as the length of cord you get.I would have liked 100ft of cord rather then 60ft but it's still worth the money & 2 TB memory is plenty & you can add 4TB more if needed.","Being my first surveillance system, I wasn't sure how hard it would be to set one up. I am a technical person and while I have never completed a wiring run or run wires through walls, I can say this is the hardest part about the setup. Once you get through this step, the rest of the setup is easy.I have done much research and through my research, I have always found experts and in general, people who own a camera system, say it is better to have a wired system vs wireless. While I will not talk about all the benefits, a few are not worrying about batteries, wireless security, and it affecting your network performance. After running the cables to the this DVR, their setup was very easy and simple. Although a few of their menus to navigate around the different settings looks complicated (they have lots of features), they take you step by step to configure your cameras the way you would like.Out of all the features my favorites are being able to select which areas of the camera you would like for the camera to ignore motion and for the cameras to actually be a deterrent system. For example, if you setup a camera for your front door to record when there is motion, you can set it to ignore any motion from cars passing by (a very nice addition).  Being a 4k surveillance system the picture is fantastic. The cameras are rated for 30 feet of night vision and I can certainly say they can reach that while still having clear picture. After 30 feet, it starts to get grainy but depending on how you setup your cameras another camera can compensate for that area.Overall, I can definitely recommend this system to anyone looking to setup a surveillance system for the first time or if you already have one. Setup is easy, picture is great, and can even deter a thief with a siren if it ever comes to it!","After years with a low cost solution that worked except at a critical moment where my neighbors car was stolen and the culprit walked on to my driveway to check our vehicles. Trying to lookback at the recording, the hard drive in the old system had crashed and no recording was available. The camera's and the floodlights chased the culprits away, but still would have been nice to have this on camera.After comparing a number of solutions in various price ranges settled on the 8 channel 4 camera package from OOSSXX . Prime delivered the system quick and prior to mounting the camera's in position hooked up the system on the test bench to make sure that everything worked. Using an Comcast XFI router the first challenge was to make sure that the camera's would get the correct IP addresses.The Comcast XFI router does not allow you to reserve IP addresses so setting fixed IP addresses for each camera is not an option so you need to use the ""automatic"" option to make it work. (This is not a shortcoming of OOSSXX, but a Comcast issue they apparently fail to address despite many complaints for this exact reason where you prefer to have fixed IP addresses for devices.)However the automatic solution works to get all the camera's connected every time following a Comcast initiated network modem reset.During the day all looked to work properly but after it turned dark, on one of the camera's would the Infrared LED''s would not turn on, the Camera switched to night mode but without the LED's there was a completely dark picture only the part where the Infrared LED's from another camera overlapped the picture was clear.I contacted the customer service department both by phone (during the weekend) and left a voicemail and emailed their service department . On Monday I received both a call back from them and an email from the service department. They gave some suggestions to test and after confirming these steps they shipped a replacement camera. I expected to have to wait for weeks to have the replacement, but 2 day's later it was delivered by Amazon. That replacement apparently got knocked around during transport and had a problem, but once again their tech support team responded immediately and a new replacement arrived 2 days later. During this process their technical team stood behind their product, kept in touch and provided better service than I have seen in a long time.As these are POE camera's and they all are on the same network, I was even able to add some of the camera's from my old system by simply leaving them connected to the old NVR for power (the old camera's use a different voltage) and I am able to record 8 channels of Video.Using the EseeCloud app on my phone I have access to the camera's from anywhere in the world.Bottom line, while the NVR might be similar to some of the other brands (or unbranded versions) but the customer service sets them apart from all the others. If I read the feedback regarding some of the large names out there, OOSSXX is miles ahead of those companies.On price versus performance, OOSSXX is the best possible option for a POE based solution","My neighborhood is getting overcrowded and I can always see strange people near my house. So I decided to invest some money in safety. This OOSSXX POE security camera system got the 4K 8-Channel NVR box and 5Mp cameras. The setup took me 35 mins by following the manual which is comprehensive and easy to follow through. I like the fact that the cameras are weatherproof and sturdy. They are able to camera video footage at such sharp resolution. The motion sensor is a plus, I can get an immediate alarm from the app when it detects any movement. I can also check my house by watching live footage from my phone. The 2TB storage is more than enough.","I shopped around for a week before I selected this system and I'm happy with my purchase. This is truly a Plug-And-Play setup. The cameras have good infrared night vision. Playback and saving video to a thumb drive is straight-forward. These cameras DO have microphones. You can set to record sound from only one camera though. The notion detection is adjustable for both sensitivity and what area of the screen is monitored. I had questions about the system both before and after purchase. I received answers in a timely manner both times. You can monitor live or playback from a PC on your network. I do not connect to it remotely from outside my home network so I can't comment on the smartphone app. *A few tips for installation & setup* Get a ""security camera junction box"" for spots where you cannot complete the connection inside through a wall. The junction box will contain the cable end and connectors and make for a cleaner-looking installation. When setting up the record schedule, I set it to record both by time and detection. That is all 24 hours selected for both modes. That way you can see what triggers the detection and what doesn't, without missing anything. I have had the 4 camera system running that way for almost 3 weeks and the 2Gb HD is about half full.",207,54,https://www.amazon.com/Update%E3%80%91-Security-OOSSXX-Waterproof-pre-Install/dp/B07Y7VNN1G/ref=sxin_14_ac_d_mf_br?ac_md=4-2-T09TU1hY-ac_d_mf_br_br&cv_ct_cx=poe+security+camera+system&keywords=poe+security+camera+system&pd_rd_i=B07Y7VNN1G&pd_rd_r=e2f14e5a-4bc8-4b4a-a37e-f8c6e3c3fade&pd_rd_w=SFCMb&pd_rd_wg=sSUE2&pf_rd_p=17756b3a-4504-468b-830d-8b5875afd168&pf_rd_r=4QSVQCDA6PEYNG58W307&psc=1&qid=1640229204&sr=1-2-ed8a42d3-65f1-4884-a3a2-0dd6e83b6876

The data compression really helps with the 8 channel feed and allows you to forget about it for a while.Pros:- Fairly cheap for a 8 channel digital set-up- Good PTZ capabilities- Fair storage cap- Good data compressionEh-Night vision is pretty good, but lacks some depth. Still, worth the costBad- Cable lengths included might be sufficient for a small shop, but generally a 8ch system with PoE will need longer cables. An option of with or without cables would be beneficial for those with a larger area needed to be covered.- This might be sufficient for a small store or home, but for a business, this is not your best option. Please invest money into a good CCTV system (a professional grade 8ch CCTV set would run $1000+).TL;DR - Good set for the pricing, but if you are looking for a long-term solution and a high quality product, this won't be it. This is meant for small operations and doesn't make the cut for professional grade.",This camera system arrived with 8 Cameras and one was bad. I contacted ANNKE support and they were very helpful. I now have the 8th camera. The photo attached is a view on my phone showing 7 cameras. We keep the 8th one in reserve for when we go on trips and use it inside the house. We have a house alarm system also so the camera system is nice when the alarm goes off and calls us. We can then tell false alarms and reset the alarm system without returning home.,"Installation was easy.The setup seems a little overly complicated, but everything works as it's supposed to.Super clear pictures on the Monitor / TV the system is hooked up to through HDMI cable.The picture quality on the phone through the app is ok.Have not contacted tech support yet.It's been running for about two weeks now, hoping that it'll continue to do so in the long run.It's not a cheap system - we went with the NVR as an upgrade to replace our Q-See system.","Honestly I did a lot of review fact checking when I bought this. First was operation and customer service, cause you all know we will need help on this type of thing.First thing we had a previous camera at our barn it is 310 feet from house it did not work.

I don’t know how it works but there is not 30 diodes that is visible at night. They have two small led you can see at night. It works great....Finally the customer service...

Worth it,Couldn't be happier,Amazing PoE camera system for reasonable price,"Great system, with some hiccups",decent package - Steve from Customer support is great.,"I have purchased the 8 channel 5mp POE video surveillance system and I am happy with it.The camera system has an internal storage space of 1tb which is very convenient.I have the cameras recording 24/7 and found that the weekly overwrite on the NVR (due to space limitations) was too quick for my needs.Installed POE via NVR to camera with cat 5e cable and installation is easy. Basically, plug and play.If the cables will be installed outside I recommend using exterior direct burial cat6 cable because the cables that are included are for interior applications. What I really liked was the fact that you are able to view it TV to nvr , and computer and cell phone via cat 5/6 internet connection from nvr to router. There is also live view and playback features.There are no monthly security company fees which is great. There are also lots of settings for motion detection, sensitivity, motion detection zones, email alerts, and app alerts. The night vision is also acceptable it helps a lot to have lighting in the viewing area.Customer service was also top notch. I had a small issue with one of the cameras. Betty helped and replaced it with zero problems. The response time was swift and all in all I cannot complain about the system. It’s well worth the money and the picture quality, playback and features are excellent.This home security system has met or exceeded nearly all my wishes and expectations.",The whole system is working great. The only issue I had was 2 out of 4 cameras build condensation inside the lens... I tried contacting support I supplied proof a few weeks ago and have yet to hear anything back about it. I am a little upset about it as it was a christmas present for my father...UPDATE: from 3 star to 5 star.Smonet honored their warrenty and replaced both cameras with little hassle... I even got to keep the faulty ones. That is good business right there...,"For my money, this SMONET 5MP security system is the absolute best in its class. Installation and setup are quick and easy, and the image quality is crisp and sharp day or night. Installation was straightforward. This is a PoE (Power over Ethernet) system, so I pulled the new CAT 5e cables. I made up a plywood drill guide to accurately drill the screw and cable holes in my soffits. With the cameras installed and the CAT5 cables in place, all that's left is to hook up the NVR. Since I usually live-view or playback when I'm away from home, the app is a crucial component. The phone app is excellent. The app also supports remote control PTZ (pan/tilt/zoom) cameras if you decide to add one or more to your system. The system comes with 4 PoE cameras, but the NVR supports up to 8, so you have room to upgrade. The playback feature is also excellent. It's quick and easy to navigate to the time period you want to replay. Simply tap the date and then select the time block (the recordings are saved in roughly 1-hour blocks). Drag the slider to find the exact period you want to replay, then tap the camera icon for a still photo or the movie icon to start recording video. I do wish there was a 30 second skip forward/back option, as this would make finding the exact moment of interest a little easier. Photos and videos are saved to local storage, you can playback video from hard drive remotely anytime anywhere. The system also supports push alerts to your phone. You can choose which cameras to send alerts and choose the portions of their fields of view to ignore so as to reduce false alarms. The motion detection is very sensitive, so I'd recommend selecting only the key ares, like your front steps and mailbox lid. Alerts are almost instantaneous. In conclusion, I would recommend this product to friends, family, and co-workers. The ease of installation is incredible, simply plug and play. If you have to through walls, or into the attic, well, that up to the home owner and has nothing to do with plug and play features","I really wanted to like the system. After a really hard, time consuming 4 days labor to run cables through the attic I finally got the system working. 3 weeks in, everything was working great with all 8 cameras. Then, the horror! Suddenly instead of displaying my 8 cameras on the screen like it used to, it started showing me a 9th spot with an ipc disconnect message. It was a bit annoying, but since I could still see all of my 8 cameras, I didn't let that bother me too much. 2 weeks later, aug 1st, 2020, the menu language just change to chinese, out of the blue. Now I only have visual on 6 of my cameras, 2 of them are dead. There's no way to even attempt to fix anything, as everything is in Chinese now on the screen. Very disappointed with this one. Picture quality is very good, but as for as the software running the system, it's a complete nightmare. Don't make the mistake I made buying this one.Update 8/12/2020Support was right on the ball. They reached out to me and got the language fix and the cameras are back working normally. It looks like it takes time to reply, about 24 to 48 hours. That's why I updated my rating.","Decent camera system that allows you to build a better system around the NVR. Cameras are lower end but they get the job done especially if you're not using the motion detection. The cameras appear to not have built in motion sensors. This works ok if you have a background that's mostly static. However, add in a tree and some wind and you're getting 99+ alerts in a few hours time. The Cameras infrared LEDs are faint but still visible attracting bugs at night causing even more false alarms.The NVR is Onvif compatible and *may* support add on cameras. Since purchase I have added a few extra cameras of better quality and the NVR works with them after a little configuration. Also note I was able to capture the camera's RTSP stream from ZoneMinder so you can tweak the motion detection a little further if you like.This is not a bad system especially if you're recording 24/7 and not concerned about motion detection. The NVR works out of the box with the included cameras and mostly stays out of your way when adding 3rd party Onvif Cameras.",300,150,https://www.amazon.com/SMONET-Security-8-Channel-Recording-Surveillance/dp/B0821C2C2C/ref=sxin_14_ac_d_mf_br?ac_md=6-4-U01PTkVU-ac_d_mf_br_br&cv_ct_cx=poe+security+camera+system&keywords=poe+security+camera+system&pd_rd_i=B0821C2C2C&pd_rd_r=e2f14e5a-4bc8-4b4a-a37e-f8c6e3c3fade&pd_rd_w=SFCMb&pd_rd_wg=sSUE2&pf_rd_p=17756b3a-4504-468b-830d-8b5875afd168&pf_rd_r=4QSVQCDA6PEYNG58W307&psc=1&qid=1640229204&sr=1-4-ed8a42d3-65f1-4884-a3a2-0dd6e83b6876

This system is a WINNER!,This is a great product!!,I am very happy with this camera system,"I purchased this system after reviewing other comparable security systems. For 4k cameras, a 3tb hard drive and all of this on an 8 channel poe nvr, the value really can't be matched. After a couple weeks with the system, here is what I've found:NVR:It's similar to other security system software that is on the market. There are a few things worth mentioning, though.1) While going through picture setting adjustments for cameras, some of the settings are shown, but if you click to adjust them, it does not allow you to change. This is minor and most other picture adjustment settings are possible. Little things like this should be easily fixed with a firmware update.2) This is the biggest one for me. These 4k cameras and the nvr are capable of extra features like human detection, barrier crossing, etc... There are even sections of the nvr where you can go to adjust these settings; however, the nvr says these features are not available for the cameras when actually going to the respective settings pages. I reached out to Hiseeu about this and they were very quick to respond. These may be updated in a firmware update at some point. I really think these features should be working by default, but basic motion zones and detection are working so I can't justify deducting a star. Hopefully there's a firmware update coming soon to fix/add these items.CamerasThese are surprisingly good cameras. Picture is slightly washed during very bright portions of the day, butthis can probably be corrected with further tinkering of picture settings. I like how there's audio on these cameras. Keep in mind that 4k 8mb can run at 15fps max. This isn't an issue though because it will let me run them at ~25 fps at 6mb setting, which is basically one step down from 4k.OverallFor the price, these are a no brainier. I've used other (mainstream) brands and the camera quality and software was no better than Hiseeu. In fact, I've been more impressed with Hiseeu. For my needs, this system fits the bill just fine. Very pleased with the purchase.Note to manufacturer:Please provide updated firmware to fix the camera settings and enable the advanced detection settings (human, barrier, etc...).Review is based off:Hiseeu 4K PoE Security Camera System, 8CH 8MP Home Video Surveillance DVR Kit with 3TB Hard Drive",This system is very nice. When you pick up one of these cameras you know immediately that its a high quality device. You will want to mount these securely and not just into drywall with drywall screws. Use the provided mounting screws. The photos are the live feed on my iPhone 8+ which isn't anywhere near as high quality as when viewed on my 4k monitor. But these are on my phone showing live action from over 30 miles away from the building. Some of the views are washed out because they point towards the front windows but I use them in the evening when the facility is open and it is lit overhead with lights. I'll post another picture of the 4 way view later.The support people are amazing. The only thing is they are available in the evening but they respond instantly and are very helpful. I will purchase more cameras from them if I decide if I need more views in my facility. You can't go wrong with this system. I love the power over ethernet for the cameras. If you buy this you will be happy with your purchase. I'm a 65 yr old and am very picky with products I've purchased. I've returned so much stuff I've not been happy with but not this system. 5 stars.,"This systems has all the features of the more expensive brands and more. I have an ARLO system at home and the Hiseeu system blows it out of the water! The image quality is just superb UHD (day and night). I no longer have to rely on sensor recorded segments, missing most of the event I wanted to look at. With the Hiseeu it records 24/7 and marks whatever triggers the sensor. I just need to install 3 cameras at home. So far I have only tested one camera. I will update this review once all cameras are installed and running. Did I mention custmer srvc is also outstanding?","I had in my home a CCTV system that has some years. I was looking for an upgrade and noticed that 4k NVRs are trending now. When I compared the specs of this Hiseeu against other brands out there I noticed that this product met and sometimes exceeded the same specifications but it was less expensive.Although I was skeptical, I bought it and installed the system by myself. In a nutshell, this system is by far way more advanced than the one I had that costed me almost the same several years ago.Things that I like are:1. 4k quality picture is way more clear and cover a lot of space.2. Night vision is spectacular. At the beginning I thought I had a light on in my backyard as it looked very bright but that is how the camera actually works.3. It has an integrated microphone. This is a game changer as it not only gives you eyes but ears as well. This is very convenient specially when unusual activities are happening near outside your home.4. Hard drive is huge; no concerns about storage.5. Camera construction feels superior when compared to others I have; metal construction, heavy and solid.For me, I'm extremely happy with this product. In my opinion, this is a great buy and the price is hard to beat.","I have owned several camera systems in the past, with this one, I am really impressed with the sharp picture quality which is far better than any camera system I've ever used before. Also tech support by email was very responsive and friendly when I needed some help initially. They answered all emails by the next morning. They also provided me with a firmware update and it solved a problem I had, after I installed the firmware update, the system worked perfectly. It is nice to see that they provide support if you need help. There are certainly other security camera manufacturers who don't provide support on anything, although I won't name names.Set up is pretty straight forward, the instructions are easy to follow. After you set it up, you can view the cameras either with an HDMI monitor or TV connected directly to the NVR, a web browser on your local area network, a smartphone app called Guard Viewer, or the desktop computer version of the app called Guard Viewer. (These apps are free downloads). I like how the cameras use Ethernet cables instead of how older style camera systems operate with coax cable with a power cord for every camera. I also like how the hard drive is 3 TB which is a lot, storage space is therefore not an issue, and I like how the cameras record sound too. I just record everything 24 hours a day, and when there is motion detected in a recording, you can find it pretty easily in your app, because the timeline you scroll through notes motion with a different color than no motion. I like how there are no fees of any kind to access your own cameras remotely. Apparently this system can be expanded to up to 8 cameras if you want as well. Overall, I think this is a great value. I am looking forward to many years of use.",150,75,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Hiseeu-Surveillance-Waterproof-Hikvision/dp/B09DV1CBXR/ref=sxin_12_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?cv_ct_cx=poe+security+camera+system&keywords=poe+security+camera+system&pd_rd_i=B09DV1CBXR&pd_rd_r=e2f14e5a-4bc8-4b4a-a37e-f8c6e3c3fade&pd_rd_w=wWfZQ&pd_rd_wg=sSUE2&pf_rd_p=4ad71b32-b810-4124-8735-d02a39478d0c&pf_rd_r=4QSVQCDA6PEYNG58W307&qid=1640229204&sr=1-4-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE2R0VVQU9GMkVQWEomZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA0Nzc5MDcyOTI5SUE0UUxSUlRHJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3NDc4MzlXRksxMEg0MTBRUFkmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWMmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl

But I honestly believe anyone with the ability to follow simple instructions and capable of minor troubleshooting should find this system very easy to install and use. This is the first DVR I've set up that provides POE to the cameras via the built-in switch. This greatly simplifies and cleans up the installation. Many of the problems I see in these reviews can be fixed via simple troubleshooting. I haven't actually had to contact Reolink support so I can't really comment on how available or helpful they are. I just wanted to point out a few of the negative things I've seen posted and offer a few tips/explanations.Cameras/Channels cutting out - When you're running your cables in the ceilings and walls, steer clear of electrical interference. Don't let the network cables touch existing wiring or things like light fixtures. Also avoid heat - like ductwork if at all possible. This can all mess with any kind of network traffic and especially 4K video feeds. It can certainly be more difficult, especially if you've never run wiring before but it is definitely worth the extra effort to route the cables properly.Complaints about video quality - I can verify this NVR absolutely records in 4K. The streams that you watch on your phone/PC/monitor are reduced quality for performance purposes. Even the ""Clear"" setting isn't near 4K. To access the full 4K video, you have to download the recorded files. This too can get confusing because unless your computer/device has a 4K GPU, you may not be able to play the files with a native media player. I installed this unit at a satellite office out of town and have not exported any files directly from the NVR but I have downloaded files remotely. These files are typically 1 to 3 GB in size. To edit or crop the videos, you will need a video editor capable of working with 4K video. This also allows you to remove the slight fisheye effect of the wide angle lenses if desired. The clarity of the video is outstanding for a system in this price-range. Frame captures are near photographic quality if you have good lighting. All of that said, if you do not have the resources to actually work with 4K video, I highly recommend setting the cameras to a more manageable resolution like 1080P. The files are smaller and just about any modern computer can work with them. These settings can be adjusted and you can change them back at any time.Complaints about outdated software - I'm not sure where this is coming from. The apps for mobile devices are as good if not better than those we've used and continue to use for more traditional DVRs. The Windows app works perfectly as well. I have no complains whatsoever. Perhaps if you're having trouble viewing the feeds, the upload speeds at the location of the NVR may not be sufficient for the resolution settings you're using.Limited camera positions - the cameras are tight in their housings but you can rotate and tilt them within the housing. You do need to install the plate close to the angle you want but someone reported that it has to be perfect and that's simply not true. If you're way off you would run into problems but I would guess you have maybe 15 to 20 degrees of play in either direction.Overall I am impressed with the quality of this system. The video is excellent quality and the night vision works great as well. Again, I have no complaints so far. I just ordered two more cameras to add to our current installation. If anything changes and we begin to have problems I will definitely be back to add to this review.","Dynamite camera. I'm using the power over ether POE and so less cables to run outside. The 4K video is outstanding. We had some loser keep hacking our wireless cameras and so this NVR is perfect. I'm personally not hooking mine up to the router either since sending the mothership manufacturer information is probably a possibility too. The video software is easy to learn even without reading any manuals. Exporting video to a thumb drive for archive is easy. I'm not using the phone app or wepage connection so don't know about those (heard one used flash video which is not secure)Things that might shock you 1) The mounting turret is more like a key, make sure the camera is pointed the right way on it before mounting the bracket/turret the camera sits on - no problem. 2) The DVR doesn't allow you to delete videos....ever! Really makes sense after you think about it. Conversely after less than one month your hard drive will be full and it will write back on top of itself....so get anything interesting off that hard drive or upgrade size hard drive.The rain season here hasn't started but the book says not to submerge the cameras but the YouTube videos show it being sprayed down (suspiciously without an RJ45 connection). So far so good Reolink !",Quality budget system. I have 5 cameras setup so far and it's very clear. App is easy to use. Windows client app is robust and supports PTZ. App allows up to 4x speed. Windows client allows up to 16x. Lots of color and contrasts settings to play with. Night mode is very clear.Cons: HDD is too small. (5 cameras filled it in 6 days). I replaced it very easily with a 4TB drive. Operating system must be built into the board so you don't even need to reinstall software just format the drive via their software.App fails to play video on 1st click sometimes but that could be my network connection.Can only download 30s clips via mobile app.Motion sensors are turned down to 15 and I still get alerts for bugs flying in front of the camera. Maybe a future firmware upgrade could allow a setting for where the ground/floor is?Lenses sometimes fog in high humidity (pre rain),"The system works and setup was not bad at all. I would give the company a recommendation. It works great for a security system with a NVR. However when its in a traditional security setup, you can't use the cameras for any ""fun projects"", like time lapse recordings (either ahead of need, or from the recorded feed).Also the NVR sits in a closet. I would expect all control and MAINTENANCE could be from the PC app. But this is not the case, you can update the firmware of the NVR from your PC, but the firmware of the cameras has to be done locally on the NVR. This requires you to still download the firmware on a PC to a flash drive, then on the NVR you need a local monitor, and control is only via a mouse. Ugh. Make all updates be from my desk please, also make them ""Auto"".And firmware is not simple, you got a hardware version and a software version to deal with. Lot of number matching. Just remember you need to update the PC/Client software, the NVR software, and the camera software all through different processes. That is a complaint. I have not done the cameras yet (I got 6, with with 3 different values of HW/SW tags) as it just seems painful.","This is the third system I have bought, returned the first two. They were wireless and did not work at distances they said they would work, not even close. The second one had 2 bad cameras out of 4 - tired of being QA for these sloppy companies. How do they make a buck with all the returns? This is a wired system, poe (power over ethernet). A bit of a hassle to run wires, but the wireless needed power so you are either running extension cords or ethernet cables. The ethernet cables are probably easier and then no worries about distance. NVR worked, software is fairly intuitive, I have had no problems. The 4K resolution is great, but the wide angle makes everything pretty small. It would be nice to adjust viewing angle, it would be nice to daisy chain cameras.",442,37,https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Recording-Detection-Surveillance-RLK8-800D4/dp/B0811V48LG/ref=sxin_12_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?cv_ct_cx=poe+security+camera+system&keywords=poe+security+camera+system&pd_rd_i=B0811V48LG&pd_rd_r=e2f14e5a-4bc8-4b4a-a37e-f8c6e3c3fade&pd_rd_w=wWfZQ&pd_rd_wg=sSUE2&pf_rd_p=4ad71b32-b810-4124-8735-d02a39478d0c&pf_rd_r=4QSVQCDA6PEYNG58W307&qid=1640229204&sr=1-5-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE2R0VVQU9GMkVQWEomZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA0Nzc5MDcyOTI5SUE0UUxSUlRHJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA0OTg0MzQyVlhBUExBODZUQzhIJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3Bfc2VhcmNoX3RoZW1hdGljJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

Would definitely recommend.","I was gonna give it 4 stars for the fact that the FOV is narrow, but I needed 3 in front anyway for my walkway.I have to use 3 cameras just to cover my front yard, which is where both of my vehicles are parked.The audio can only be on one camera at a time so I keep it on the middle one.It has tripwire, along with perimeter and zone coverage for the alarm.Some might not like the fact that it only goes up and down for adjustment, so ya will have to play with the camera mounts to spin it around to get the right angle, so for now if its mounted its just straight out the front.I don't know why Hiseeu put the mounts on upside down, I had to turn them all around, because when you mount the camera you was the cable output hole to be at the bottom, so rain or moisture can not get into the base mount,All in all these are pretty good cameras.For now I have the cables hidden on the awning of my porch because I wanted to make sure they would work good, next I am going to add conduit boxes to each camera and stash all new cables inside each one connecting each box via pvc pipe, this was its nice and clean and the thieves cant cut the wires easily.I was hoping to find turret cameras on hiseeus' website but all they have atm is bullets.I will post any updates to these but so far I am liking them, just had to google a few times to find help on setting the security up.Update 8 Dec 2020If you wanted to be able to back up your video and watch on your pute well then do not buy this system.Recording at .265 it saves the backup as 1: .H265 2: AVI 3: MP4None of which are actual video files.I tried and have a 800m file of each type and cant watch any of them and no conversion info, they put a codec file on your flash drive when you do the back up and windows says TOO OLD CANT USE.So now do I wanna take these back down and send them back since they dont do the job well or just say to heck with it and make a blue iris setup for these.Last night I also have a ir failure for some reason, at 3:22 AM the Ir went out and I got the alarm, and then a min later I hear a click on the video and the ir is back, all the other cams were OK.Update 14 Dec 2020If you need to download a video i have found out that the app they have ya use is perfect for it, I can download my videos to my phone then just copy them to my computer for editing.Stay tuned for more updates.",Very easy to install especially if you have attic access. I mounted the cameras on the soffit so I simply drilled a one inch hole in the soffit and pushed the camera wiring through then screwed the camera in place. I put the unit in an out of the way closet to make it harder for thieves to find but I wanted a moniter in my living room over the front door so I bought a cheap monitor for the closet by the unit for when I need to review footage. I got a 60' HDMI cable to run from the closet to the monitor over the front door and added a HDMI splitter so I could have both monitors active at the same time. The included CAT cables were more than long enough and the cameras power also runs through the cable so just a quick connection to the camera and the unit and you good to go. I have not connected to the internet (I have to run a cable from my modem to the unit) but will do so soon.Very happy with the system. Cameras have a good picture and the face capture is a nice touch. It does record sound on each camera but is only available on playback as far as I can tell but thats fine. Face capture does not seem to work well on night vision but the cameras do so I don't see that as a real issue. I will buy this again for any future houses I buy.Update: I figured out how to get sound to play live. You have to mouse click the sound icon on the screen to turn on/off sound while live viewing. Sound will still record for all cameras for playback.,"After our cars were broken into, it became necessary that we needed a security system in case another incident occurred. I didn't want to spend thousands on a system that required a monthly subscription or extra ""add-ons"" to make the user experience better (translated as pay for their marketing dept). After a lot of research and reviews, this system was exactly what we needed. The camera images are clear (including night vision) and are simple to view them on our TV and phones. After checking the cameras to make sure they worked properly and then ran the provided Ethernet cables to it's final destination, the cameras were simply plug and play, since the cables provide power to the cameras too. I also don't have to worry about changing batteries or a weak WIFI signal using this system.Initially, I was having an issue connecting the DVR to our internet, and after an email to their help desk, Kiki from Hiseeu quickly responded with not only the correct troubleshooting information, but went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. They even offered to video chat with me to ensure everything went smooth. Talk about great customer service! I highly recommend this system and Hiseeu!","I’ve had two NightOwl and two ZOSI systems in the past but was plagued with problems on each one. But this Hiseeu is fantastic and addresses every one of the complaints I had with those other security systems.1 Setup was simple and straightforward, a pure plug and play setup. No complicated networking setup, just scan the barcode and plug in the cameras and your ready to go.2 The POE is great. No need to run separate power cables, just the one Ethernet cable.3 The picture quality is superb, being able to recognize faces even when the subject is small on the screen.4 I like being able to set up each camera differently. We are living in the jungle of Costa Rica and I wanted to be able to use motion detection on most of the cameras and spot the exotic wildlife passing by, yet one camera is just on our entry gate and I have face detection set up on that particular one.5 So far the DVR is much more dependable than any of the other systems I’ve used. On but the NightOwl and the ZOSI I had frequent problems and would have to reboot the systems. It’s no fun when you’re on vacation in another country and you can’t monitor your property because the DVR needs a reboot. At this point I’ve been up and running for 5 weeks and the system has been going nonstop with no need to reset anything.6 The mobile app is infinitely better than any of the others I’ve used. It is very intuitive for remote replay. And the start and stop are well timed to not use up much hard drive space. Usually I can review the entire night on one camera in around five minutes because the video starts and ends when the action starts and ends.So without a doubt I would recommend and already have recommended this system to others and I would purchase it again if looking for a DVR.(SIX MONTH UPDATE Nov.2, 2021)I recently had my farthest camera (about 200 feet distance) stop working. I texted the customer service and they suggested how to check the camera. It was clear from the test that the camera had gone bad for whatever reason. I wrote it off as one of those things that just happen. The next morning I received an email from KiKi that they had already sent out a new camera to replace it. I have never seen customer service like that. Without a doubt they have my business forever, especially with their great product. I’ve now purchased one of their solar PZT cameras and will leave a review when I get the chance to install it.And by the way, 6 months later the system is still working perfectly, with not a single stop nor need to reboot the system. Take my experience with four previous systems from other companies. These are the best.",506,262,https://www.amazon.com/Hiseeu-Security-Outdoor-Support-Surveillance/dp/B08XXGZVT2/ref=sxin_12_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?cv_ct_cx=poe+security+camera+system&keywords=poe+security+camera+system&pd_rd_i=B08XXGZVT2&pd_rd_r=e2f14e5a-4bc8-4b4a-a37e-f8c6e3c3fade&pd_rd_w=wWfZQ&pd_rd_wg=sSUE2&pf_rd_p=4ad71b32-b810-4124-8735-d02a39478d0c&pf_rd_r=4QSVQCDA6PEYNG58W307&qid=1640229204&sr=1-3-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE2R0VVQU9GMkVQWEomZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA0Nzc5MDcyOTI5SUE0UUxSUlRHJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA4MzU5MjMyM0RINVFYVkxRMjQxJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3Bfc2VhcmNoX3RoZW1hdGljJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

A couple of cameras closest to the NVR are on a home run. Those cameras connect to two of the PoE jacks in the back of the NVR and the rest come in on a single LAN jack, which includes the one WiFi camera. It works great.There is almost no documentation included with the products so I went to the Reolink website. It's unbelievably bad...as if it's been written with Google translate. The system is pretty much plug-and-play, but if you run into any issues you're kind of on your own to figure it out. Suggestion for Reolink: You've created a nice product; spend a few bucks and hire an English-speaking editor to clean up your website. Example: One of your staff contributors said sharing cameras via a switch is a great solution-- another said it's not recommended for more than two cameras.

Never have we had a problem with any portion of this system... it's quite actually been a plug & play operation for us. The install was the toughest job, and only then because we were building our own cables to accommodate exterior applications (UV/buriable outdoor cable) and very long/difficult cable pulls between stories and rooms of our building. Our cameras have now experienced two very cold winters in snow and ice, but most commonly see rain (in OR. state) with a few short months of good sunshine. They have all worked flawlessly. No complaints. The night vision is quite impressive on even just the RLC410 units. We've also got an RLC423, RLC511, and a few others. Each camera has performed admirably. All thumbs up to the folks at Reolink for producing such an affordable product that is also incredibly well built and versatile.My only ONLY grip is that when/if you wish to speak to a customer support person on the phone and ask direct questions in real time... there doesn't seem to be a way to pull that off. Instead its a string of email Q&A with their support staff that can drag on for days to answer one otherwise simple question.On the plus side... their staff is very helpful, though it's clear that English isn't their native tongue. Some of the replies are kinda cryptic and some of my questions need to be asked in another fashion, in order to be addressed. But I'm not hating. Just wishing I could actually speak to some guy named chuck that sounds just like I do.","The easiest software I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I have installed several systems from different manufacturers. I won't get into the name dropping here but from a system installer perspective, Reolink has very solid and easy to follow software. The hardware is just as impressive. I installed 12 cameras at my house without any issues. The attached picture really does not show the amount of detail these cameras display. The attached picture is a screenshot from my phone. I have had them up and running for 2-weeks now with no problems. As others have mentioned the motion detection is somewhat sensitive, but I would prefer this to be the case. The night viewing is impressive with great black and white clarity.

The camera quality and performance is top notch. My son had purchased a different system a few months ago and was very impressed with the quality of the Lorex system.

Both of those systems had big issues, like losing all cameras for no reason, losing one camera that required daily reset and reconfiguration, etc. Not so with the Lorex. This is a great looking system and super easy to install. The app is much better too and gives me fast easy access to cameras remotely. One thing I noticed was the 4K cameras produce a much better picture than the Reo system did, but both are suppose to be the same picture quality. The Lorex six camera system cost about the same as the Reo four camera system, so to me it's actually a better value for the money. Also, I really like the added white LEDs on the camera that turn on to warn a person who enters the sensor area that yes, there's a camera and yes, you're already recorded on the system, so ""Smile!""","Instillation was fairly simple and required no calls to tech support, Major plus in my opinion. Picture quality is excellent and the night vision works very well. I’m still exploring software setup options and tweaking settings to meet my needs. The Lorex Home mobile app functions well and is a nice feature to have. If this new unit works as good as my previous still working 12 year old DVR did it’s a 5 star for sure. Main reason for upgrading was improved picture quality and the NVR POE cameras capabilities.One recommendation for Lorex would be to included a couple 100 or maybe 150 ft cables for the cameras. I found that the included 60ft cables were adequate for 4 out of the 6 camera runs, and would probably meet most home owners needs. In my case the runs were between 20 and 150ft. Although this is not a deal breaker and cables can be easily made or purchased for longer runs, it would of been nice.","These are incredible cameras the best I ever had, Night Vision Works flawlessly facial recognition vehicle recognition all the bells and whistles.","Very happy with this system pros great quality picture, night video is good quality.

I’m very careful about taking it exactly as prescribed so it was strange that I had run out 10 days early. For reasons I won’t get into for this review, I suspected the property manager of my building was stealing it. Obviously that sounded crazy, but I couldn’t think of another explanation. A friend suggested a Ring camera, so I bought one never expecting anything to actually come of it. I put some antihistamines in my now empty pill bottle thinking no one would ever take them, set up the camera when it arrived, and felt more secure knowing it was there. Set up was simple so I figured worst case scenario, I was out a bit of money and I spent maybe 10 minutes setting it up.Fast forward a week later when I get a notification via the app that there was motion detected on my camera. I open up the recording and there she is, entering my apartment, going right for my decoy pills, taking them, and leaving. I immediately left work to get back home. I called the police who sent an officer. I showed him the video and he admitted that had I not had the video, he wouldn’t have believed me. I was able to quickly and easily send the video to the police and to the president of the company that owns my building. I also was able to download the video and get it uploaded so that I have copies of it as I go through the next few months as she (hopefully) gets brought to justice.I cannot emphasize how much this little camera has helped me. I would not have caught my burglar otherwise. Because of it, they were able to look up records of who used their electronic key to access my apartment and she had been in there 7 times over the month prior. This would have gone on for longer and who knows if it would have resulted in harm to myself or my cat had I not caught her. This camera has given some of the sense of security she stole from me back and stopped a nightmare situation from worsening. I will still be recovering from this for long time and I am hoping she is brought to justice, but I cannot thank Ring enough for helping me secure my home from an unexpected source of danger.","This camera for $60 is a solid deal.

No problem with refurbished they stand behind them and you can’t tell the difference.,"I own 6 Ring cameras. 2 doorbell cams, 1 interior Ring cam, 2 Ring spotlight hardwire cams and this new battery powered with solar array Ring spotlight cam. I have owned Ring cameras for a very long time - long before Amazon bought them. The Ring experience these days under Amazon is far superior to 5+ years ago when Ring was a stand alone outfit. My point here is that I have a LOT of Ring camera experience and I've seen a long list of Ring issues and quirks. I bought refurb because I've never had any issues with the other 3 Ring refurbs I've purchased from Amazon - that didn't work out so well for a number of customers.I added this refurbished battery camera to a high sunlight area on my home that would have been a pain to hardwire. I'll go through a few tips based on my 5+ years of Ring camera use and my experience with this new battery operated Ring camera and solar array combo.I read many of the 1 & 2 star ratings and they center around a few recurring issues:-Missing parts - that's not a camera issue, that's an Amazon issue. Send it back and have Amazon make it right-Camera won't hold signal. Two things here - these folks either lack the proper bandwidth or the camera is too far from the modem. That's it - I've never had any issue with WIFI connection that was not modem or bandwidth related. I have 1 GB Verizon FiOS, the new, updated modem and good proximity to the camera from the modem - it kicks butt. If you do NOT have great WIFI with the latest modem and good proximity, you WILL suffer.-The batteries won't fully power up with the solar array. CHARGE the batteries on a USB power cable indoors to 100% BEFORE you install them in the camera! It took me 7 hours for one battery and 6 for the other to fully charge. I use two batteries - the refurb price allowed me to spend the extra $30 on the additional battery.-You need enough sun - my solar array gets full sun for 8-12 hours a day. If you try to squeak by with 1-3 hours, it can be an issue.-Understand the settings on the camera to conserve power and set up the motion zones and sensitivity. Some of the 1-2 star issues were the result of not fully comprehending those fine details.My four photos show the clarity of view, the solar array installed, the camera installed and the ""Device Health"" screenshot that shows both batteries at 100% and the solar array properly connected. Like I said - charge the batteries FIRST to 100% on a power cord and then insert them the camera. Both batteries have been outside in this camera for 2 weeks and they are at 100% because I have a ton of sun with no shade trees nearby.Installation can range from a simple 30 minute setup if you have DIY skills to absolute torture if you do not possess the Liam Neeson like ""particular set of skills"". In my case, I can fix most anything and I used 3 inch stainless trim square drive screws through the vinyl corner posts into the framing underneath. Solid as granite when done. I used a siding separating tool and pulled the siding apart, ran the solar array connection wire under the siding and snapped it back together. Liam Neeson easy - if you have the tools and skills.I've had HUGE issues with Ring cameras early on especially with the doorbell units that were an enormous pain in the butt prior to the Amazon acquisition of Ring. Since then, I've never had an issue with any of the Ring spotlight cams, hardwire or battery powered. Your experience may (will!) vary. Hope that helps!","Ring has a good product. My only complaint is the distance that it detects motion. For example, I have it pointed at my driveway, but it only catches when a vehicle pulls up close. It works, but it would be nice if it caught it a little further down the driveway. However, this review is mostly on refurbished devices. Many people refuse to buy because it isn’t “brand new”. Well actually they are. They are cleaned up, repaired and brought up to the same standards as “brand new” ones. So why not save yourself, in some cases, a good chunk of money? The only difference with this it was refurbished. When I opened the package it looked exactly like the ones I bought for full price. I couldn’t see any difference. And you get the same warranty. So do yourself a favor, consider refurbs and save yourself some money!","I have the spotlight cam, doorbell pro, stuck up cam, full security system and the new indoor cam. This thing is awesome. It's a little bulky but I am really impressed with picture quality and the spotlight is alot brighter than I expected. I have this hooked up to a solar panel and it charges fairly quick in the Georgia sun.My only complaint is the hardware included. They have to be the cheapest screws ever. I dont understand why they dont send quality hardware or self tapping screws..",5869,227,https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Refurbished-Spotlight-Battery-White/dp/B07GT9L6SQ/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=ring+outdoor+security+camera&qid=1640229711&sr=8-16

I purchased this refurbished Ring battery cam, and am very very happy with it. It requires no wiring, the entire device is powered by an internal rechargeable battery.More on the battery: The Battery life is insane. it came with 47% battery life out of the box, and I've used it for 3 weeks, and it's at 36% battery life. I did buy another battery to swap it out when it gets low. There are also solar options, but I'm good with swapping it out, but it seems like it will last at least 2 months on a full charge.You can install it a few ways, I did a wall mount to watch my front door area. I attached an image of the image quality in the app at night (there is a small lamp on my door area, so night vision isn't needed for my setup)The Ring app is great, it connects you and your neighbors to share warnings and get notifications for things going around in the community. Your camera is 100% private unless you decide to share. You will get notifications when someone steps in front of the camera, you can talk to them, etc.Setup took a couple of tries to allow it to update, but once I connected it to my wifi It was working.Make sure your wifi reaches the device.As far as a review of the refurbished aspect, you could tell it had been repackaged, but it was professionally done. There were no marks or damage on the product, just a couple o fingerprints. Would gladly purchase another refurbished product from Ring or Amazon.","I decided to add a camera to my new out-building. I decided to give this battery powered unit a shot. I already have a Ring doorbell, and a larger wired system. This little camera has been great. Clear picture. Easy to add to my Ring App. Battery life seems perfectly manageable. It has been running for weeks now, on lower power consumption settings. Battery is down maybe 85%? Best part, if I want to take it and use it elsewhere, I could.","Purchased because I have a recessed porch which makes seeing someone at the front door difficult, also a large open backyard which is extremely dark at night. I now get visual alerts and can see who is at my front door or when packages arrive, and if something is in the backyard or on the deck. Night vision is clear, easy installation and activating them took 30 minutes. Feel much safer with these cameras up now. Mine are mounted so I can reach them with a step ladder if I need to charge the batteries.","Camera is on front of our house and front of our driveway. Works great. Sometimes a little TOO great. We have a shared driveway and our neighbors apparently use the driveway ALOT lol :-). The boundaries work perfectly. Picture is extremely clear. Was extremely easy to mount. Mounted, configured, and up and running in about half an hour. The only thing that is a pain (and it may just be a setting I haven’t found yet) is when we get a motion alert it takes a few seconds for camera to load the recording. I love the linking feature so I can trigger my side driveway camera at the same time so I can record both parts of my driveway.","I got a great deal on this on one of Amazon's lightning deals. I was a little skeptical as it is refurbished. However, it was received in like new condition and was up and running in no time.

It sounds like a lot of work but believe me it was not. Camera works really good the quality is amazing and the sensors and night vision are on point. The fact that you can turn on the lights and the built-in siren or alarm its really good. If you see something going on outside your home and you think is not safe to go outside just turn on the alarm and that will alert whoever is outside.,"Simple set up, great clarity, lots of settings, intuitive to use, solid mounting system and good product support.I've owned Ring cameras for a long time (for years before Amazon acquired them in 2018. I own 7 Ring cameras including these spotlight cams, a couple of doorbell cams and one interior cam. The quality of Ring products in general has increased incrementally over the years since Amazon dished out $1 billion for them in 2018. Ironically, the geniuses on ""Shark Tank"" passed on funding Ring when it was a startup in 2013! The founder, Jamie Siminoff literally laughed all the way to the bank.Pro/Con of this spotlight corded model:-Simple initial camera set up-Clear image, night and day-Great adjustability via the app settings for lights, camera, motion and overall device data-Easy outdoor installation IF you have the right stuff on hand-Great cloud recording that has a flat yearly rate for 4+ cameras (I have 7 cameras)-Far better support these days than the pre-2018 merger-App works great-Camera quality overall has increased greatly since the original ""Doorbell"" cameras were launched. Those early doorbell models could be an enormous pain to set up, power up and install in general and there were a lot of defective models in circulation - not anymore. I've bought 4 ""refurbed"" Spotlight cameras and all were perfect.Con:-You need really solid WIFI bandwidth, an up to date modem and good proximity from the camera to the modem. Many of the 1 & 2 star reviews stem from lack or proper bandwidth, a junky modem or too much distance between the camera and the modem. I upped my WIFI to Verizon FiOS 1GB plus the newest FiOS modem (that's key - 1GB with an outdated modem is pointless) and all my cameras work great. BUT, if you don't have those fundamentals, you can/will have massive problems.-You need an available power outlet outside to plug this in unless you ""customize"" the power cord (I did that).I had to cut the 2 pronged plug off my camera to thread the wire from the outside of my home to the inside of the garage where my power source is located and then attach an after market 2 pronged plug. Not an issue for me but it could be for some folks so think ahead about your own installation or have it done professionally if you lack that Liam Neeson - like ""particular set of skills"".Overall, Ring cameras are vastly improved and work really well. It's impossible to address all exterior installation challenges and they do exist so be aware and prepare ahead of time.

Works well for the backyard.,Wireless Freedom - Ring Cam Battery,"New Camera, New Update!!","I have a Ring pro on my front door and loved it so much that I wanted something for the back patio since I have contracts (lawn, pool, trees, etc) in my backyard. My challenge however is that all the walls on the patio are either stucco or rock, which makes it near impossible to run a hidden power line. So I opted for this option and so far it works great. The lights are pretty bright and the motion detection works as expected.As for the battery life, it has been in for a couple weeks and it has lost about 10% battery. So I’m guessing it will last about 3 months before it needs a charge. I just ordered a second battery which should double that battery life.The connection is very quick, it seems to connect much faster than my front door, but in fairness it is closer to the wireless router.As for installation, I installed it using the provided screws into the frame of my patio door. It actually works perfect there because you can’t really see it and allows me to perfectly position it for motion detection.My only complaint is the motion zone setup. Unlike the ring pro where I can “draw” motion zones (which significantly helps reduce motion alerts), it only allows you to specify a distance. It really isn’t very intuitive, so I just leave it at mid-range and it seems to work just fine for now.Beware, in order to have video playback, you do have to subscribe to the ring premium service. And you have to have a subscription per device! I have it for my front door, not sure I’m gonna pay for the back door. That was kind of a bummer to find out I’d have to pay more. It should be a household subscription.Overall, I’m very happy with the device and would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to install solution without wires.",,We have this camera for the backyard and also the ring doorbell for the front door. We got the doorbell first and think it does the job. It is not the best nor is it the worst. Now the camera for the backyard is very nice. We got it as a safety precaution because we felt someone had used the pool while we were away and did not want that to be a safety issue. As you can see in these live pictures I just took that it covers pretty much the whole yard and you can zoom into areas on the app with your finger. Also pictured. We have the sensor set Just right to capture the movement in the backyard. At night when motion is detected the lights fire up to record. There is also an option to push an alarm on the light. It’s not super loud but loud enough for the neighbors to hear and scare persons away. I have also included a screenshot of the app view of the ring items we have.I would recommend this camera but really recommend using the solar panel with the camera and not have to worry about taking the battery out to charge it.,"Love the freedom of wireless, the solar panels work great and only need a couple of hours of sunlight per day to keep the batteries topped off. Video quality is great and I've got eyes on the whole yard now. Just picked up 3 of these beauties. Simply system anyone can install and operate. Thank You Ring!!I bought a camera system a few years ago with a hard drive a 4 wired cameras. Wires all over the house and you need a PHD in programming to get the system to work. It ended up in the trash without ever making a single recording. Ring just makes it all doable for the average Non PHD humans...","Updated Review:Received a new camera from Ring.

I put this on a hidden guest network and I am thrilled at how it works. The timeline recording features are a huge perk and I am VERY happy as it even showed me an essential situation I needed to share with a third party and it was so easy to share the data.My only suggestion to RING is that you have to make it easier to ask questions about policies. I have the warranty on the device and coverage. My question did not get answered clearly and I asked for clarification and I was dropped. My main alarm is a start of the year coverage. My new lights I got late in Q3/Q4. I asked how does the coverage get applied to keep it one date and they failed to clearly answer that. I searched and found the answer on Amazon and solved my concern, however that's Ring's job, not Amazon.","• Overview: The Ring Spotlight Camera (Battery) is a remarkable security product that offers peace of mind and simplicity to protect your property. The camera offers what I have found to be very impressive video quality (1080p) that looks fantastic on both mobile devices and computers, perfect two-way audio, a very bright LED light, and alerting 110 decibel alarm – THE FULL PACKAGE in my opinion. All features of this product are cloud based and accessible from the comfort of where YOU are, via internet connect on the Ring app or website.The Ring rechargeable battery is a truly incredible product and delivers an industry leading design, efficiency, and fulfillment of expectations. Although proprietary to Ring products, the rechargeable battery offers the perfect solution to those who may not have access to a permanent power solution, solar, or stable power connection. I have purchased nine (9) additional rechargeable batteries, leaving me with an total of 20 of these. In most cases, one would expect the purchase of additional batteries to be the result of poor performance and longevity; however, these fit my exact demand of two (2) batteries per spotlight camera and one (1) to keep charged on hand for my Ring Video Doorbell 2. ALL of these batteries have held a phenomenal charge in the brutal summer heats of Arizona (100-110 degrees currently) with very frequent usage through each day. It is important that consumers know mileage will vary with the battery of any Ring products as there are both sensitivity and frequency settings to capture the moments you otherwise would not.• What I loved: There is so much to take into consideration when purchasing a security camera and for me this really checked every box. The installation process is seamless, as one would expect as Ring includes EVERYTHING necessary for you to install the product with ease. This is even to include easy to follow video demonstration of how the device is set up, installed, and even the functionalities. The lights and alarm add an additional layer to prevention that I thought I would never need, and hopefully never do, but am relieved that I have. The video playback is perfect, although, internet service is going to vary for everyone. I have purchased Ring products for all of my immediate family members, and for those who have slower internet connection or poor WiFi there is noticeable differences between Live View functionality.The proprietary battery is very well construction, durable, and fits perfectly into each Ring battery operated product. I have not ran into any issues or failures. The battery charges via micro usb in approximately 6 hours from 0% battery. In a world of fast charging devices, this may seem extremely long; however, consumers should consider that these batteries will last days, if not weeks, of consistent recording, live view, and other events.• Opportunities: I would like to see a proprietary charging dock that can charge multiple batteries at once.","These are great for peace of mind. I did have to get a stronger wifi connection, but it makes sense, as we placed one camera as far from the router as possible.I love that I can pull up the camera on my app. The sound is great. I love the two-way talk option. Our front camera battery does need charging every 5-7 days, but I have it to the max sensitivity, and we're across from a decently busy street end. The backyard camera has been about 2 weeks between charging.You do need a special drill to install on brick, but it's an easy setup.","Works great at detecting motion. Good fisheye and distance in light, less distance about 50-70 feet at night. Love that I can turn on light and talk through camera. (Make sure you do 2-factor security) Got 30 day free trial. I have outdoor with a non-Ring solar panel, using one battery. Never runs out. I had to get a range extender because my router is central in the house. even with a range extender it is skipping at times. I wish this model had an antenna built in or at least when connected to the solar panel used the connection as an antenna.","A snap to install, and connect to my existing Ring setup. These two cameras provide outstanding coverage for two backyard gates on either end of the house. Installed now for almost two months in triple digit Arizona heat, and a couple of fierce monsoon storms, and holding up extremely well. (I did instill them under eaves to partially protect them). So far, very happy with battery life as well. Was worried they would go through the battery quickly, but after almost two months on the job, showing 75% and 78% charge on the two units. Guessing at that rate I'll get around 6 months or so.",1643,71,https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Spotlight-Cam-Battery-Security/dp/B07K7GQTSB/ref=sr_1_17?keywords=ring+outdoor+security+camera&qid=1640229711&sr=8-17

GREAT SYSTEM.","***update*** changed to 5 star, if you set the camera to battery mode and then plug in the power outlet, it keeps the battery charged at 100% allowing the camera to use hardwire and battery power for backup in the event power is cut. This works as I intended, just need to figure out the setting*** Descent camera, but I am a little frustrated at a couple things. First, the inside camera allows you to mount upside down and then flip the camera view in the app. This was my install plan with the outside cam, but the outside cams do not offer the video invert option in the app. They claim this is for motion sensing issues, but I suspect it is so they can sell you the additional top mount. The biggest issue I have is that the stick up cams can be used with battery or plug in, so I bought the extra batteries thinking they would charge when the power supply was plugged in (nope) and that they would work as a back-up power supply if power is lost (also nope) the batteries have to be removed to charge and you have to manually switch between battery power or power supply within the app. I basically wasted $40 on batteries I’ll never use. I have an outside outlet on a timer I use for Xmas lights and I wanted to use the same outlet for the camera thinking when the timer kicked off the battery would kick in keeping the camera live, nope, camera will not automatically revert to battery backup. Apparently they just made it so they can sell the same camera as either battery or power supply.. no point in having both without them working together and being automated, which is not the case. I also tried to research this before purchasing the batteries and I could not get a clear answer anywhere which I think is intentional. Otherwise this camera is as advertised, works well, picture and night vision are good and other features seem to work as described. Setup was easy.","Bought this after learning about do-it-yourself security cameras. This Ring Stick up indoor outdoor security camera is a good quality security for $99. Firstly, I went to a geek tech store and bought a security cameras set and was completely disappointed with my experience and the marked up prices. This camera is very easy to install yourself. The picture quality is great. The App is easy to navigate and for $99 you can see what’s happening in front of your property when you are away and added security when you are home. I recommend using the Ring stick up plug in security camera....comes with an 8ft and 22ft cord 30ft total... if you can drill a hole on the exterior to the inside of your home to reach a electrical outlet to plug this device in that is the best option without the hassle of recharging batteries. I tried the recharge battery mode and did not like it but if you do go the battery route make sure you get the correct solar panel (called Ring Super Solar Panel) that will help the battery life. I understand some people can’t drill holes where they live and recharging battery mode with a solar panel is an ideal option for some. Hope this was helpful.","This is my third Ring camera (door bell, inside camera and now this outside camera), and I have become sold on Ring products. This stick-up plug-in outside camera exceeded my expectations. I mounted it on the side of the house under the eaves. Physical mounting was very easy, and the cord was long enough to reach through the eaves to an outlet in the attic without needing an extension cord. The ball-and-socket joint in the mount allowed sufficient angle adjustment that I didn't need a separate mounting bracket. The angle of coverage is generous, the image is crisp, and the Infrared night vision is incredible. It's easy to connect to WiFi, although be advised: when first connecting, it upgrades the software and tells you it could take up to 5 minutes. Mine took 10-15 minutes with a high-speed router, so be patient. There is also a wide range of parameters for the camera you can set with the Ring app, making it even more versatile. I highly recommend it.","I purchased the 2 Pack of the Ring Stick Up Camera Plug-In, but I have only put up one of them at this point (long story). However, I wanted to write this review because I felt doing so might help some others trying to decide if they should buy Ring or not. First thing I have to say that when you receive something from Ring the packaging screams quality. No cheap of flimsy box; everything that is in the package is well protected and yet easy to get out.Before I installed the camera I ordered a battery for backup. After installing the battery I set the camera up following the directions. The Ring android app made it extremely easy to get the camera connected to my network. Once that was done I took the camera outside and found the location where I wanted to install it based on the area of view I wanted covered. By the way, I did order one of the Ring ceiling mounts for it, but the more I looked at the area I wanted it to cover the more I realized that I could use the mount that came with the camera.There is a single screw that holds the stand on. I removed it and moved the stand/mount to the back of the camera. In order to do this you do have to removed a weather seal where the mount needs to be placed; be sure to put the weather seal in the bottom of the camera where the stand/mount was located. It is easy to do, after removing the seal just place stand/mount in the hole, put the screw back in place and you are done. Took me less than a minute. I then marked the location where the detachable part of the mount need to go, drilled a couple of pilot holes, put the screws in and the base of the mount was in place. Snapped the camera into it and put in the security screw. After getting it mounted I plugged it in and it came right up. Used my phone to view and adjust it to cover the area I wanted covered and I was finished with mounting it. Probably took me a total of 10 minutes.So, how does it work? Great. Since I already had the app open I went to the setting menu and turned on the Record Motion and Motion Alerts feature. I turned on Motion Verification and set the Motion Zones the way I wanted them. I then set the Motion Detection and I was done with the setup.The camera has been up for 3 weeks now without any false motion notification, which is a great thing. My wife and I have looked at it quite often. It comes up quickly and the image is great for a security camera. If a friend or family member asked me if I would recommend it, my answer would be absolutely.The things that stand out in my mind are:1. The quality of the packaging, but more importantly the quality of the product itself.2. The ease of installation.3. The features and function of the app and the camera.4. The fact that I don't get false alerts, but at the same time it does alert me when it should.5. Ease of use.",6606,303,https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Stick-Up-Cam-Plug-In-HD-security-camera-with-two-way-talk-Works-with-Alexa-/dp/B07RGSG4TN/ref=sr_1_11?keywords=ring+outdoor+security+camera&qid=1640229711&sr=8-11

It takes no time at all after getting the app download and adding the device. My house is set up with various security cameras over the years. Most are not battery operated except the Ring cam. I've learned to go through the hurdle to change the router setting to 2.4 GHz and always had to make sure to do the initial setup right next to the router. I didn't have to do any of that with this security camera. The magnetic feature also makes monitor area adjustment really easy. The area I needed to set up didn't have easy access to a power outlet and it's also really far from the router. It's been up and running for more than a week now without needing to recharge. It's definitely met and exceeded my expectation.,"I already have several cameras around my house, so now I added another. Easy to use and very easy to set up. Comes with a mounting bracket, but it's not very strong but will do the job. I have gone through summer and winters with no problems. Since its rechargeable, you have to take it down every once in a while. So that means it needs to be reachable for easy removal. I usually place then where they are not exposed to the harsh elements. Play around with it first and make sure you have the right views you want before screwing anything in. Overall, pretty good affordable camera. Also make sure it's not to far from your Wi-Fi connection. Comes with usb cable, but not a ac brick charger, which are cheap enough anyway. They should have included that in the package.","Brought this product after wasting more money on many cameras, but this works as i need for my home, already had many unknown people visiting our community at night time we have to be alert everytime, and this cam is really nice and helping me out in every ways it can, wireless makes it super easy for me, also motion detection and night vision working good. Definetly a recommendable product.","I gave this little camera 5 stars because of the price and what it does for this price. It is really amazing that something this affordable can be good. I have been using 9 days it is really good working. I can control from my phone, very easy. Materials are very good guality. I think I will use long time.",This camera is one that I have been looking for because its small enough without being intrusive with the larger ones because this has the PIR motion detection. I opened it up and it was neatly packaged. First thing you need to do is charge this camera. Second you can direct connect to the router finally downloaded the app called Esseecloud.

I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't. None. Not a single thing.It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways. I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed. Nope.I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house. Nope. There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not. They are not location aware in any way. The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording. Nope!The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours. Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room. I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on. This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%. This is with all the 'battery saving options' on. This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording. So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing. I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality. The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.***UPDATE***Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera. You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then. Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't. Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera. The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support. Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.***ANOTHER UPDATE***From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"". This will be a great update and should have been available on launch. I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.***ONE MORE UPDATE***Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days. It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration. With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set. They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away. For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off. You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc. Or any combination. The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can. This is a great improvement. They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5. This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras. I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.***LAST UPDATE***Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I've had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now. All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night. Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn't bad. I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it's pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation. They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you're thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them.","Before I start my revised review, let me state that there's been a lot of news lately about people hacking into Ring cameras, but this only happens when someone installs a new camera and doesn't update the default username and password (or has an extremely weak password which is easy for a hacker to guess). This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions.Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product.Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all.Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement.A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring.Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised.***UPDATE***Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices.Ring has now updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new wireless battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well.Observations.Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool.I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a few months before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent.I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once.Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete.I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic.Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.","Had the camera up and running in less than ten minutes. Excellent quality picture. Hooking up to the solar panel when installing, this way battery is always charged. Received mounting hardware, camera has been installed.",Installed 2 of these outside my house in about 20 minutes. Mounted one above my garage and the other near my front door. The video quality is pretty good. Not facial recognition software good but good enough for a good description of people if needed. I used the mounts that came will the camera and scanned the QR code for setup. Not sure why people couldn't set up zones. It is part of the setup unless you skip over the steps. I do agree with most reviews that the notifications are spotty. Took my trash out and the one by the garage only recorded me going to the side of the house and the one by the front door only recorded me coming back. A neighbor walked by this morning and it started recording after they walked by and were down the street. Pic attached. Went outside again and the both cameras picked me up as I would have expected. I will adjust the camera and reset the zones to see if that helps. They are my first Ring cameras so there may be fine tuning on my part that is needed. Will update this as the days go by.Windows 10 app logs me in but says I don't have any cameras set up. Tried on a PC and 2 laptops. Please fix!!Phone apps are pretty good so far. (Samsung note 9)Updating to 5 Stars.....After adjusting my zones and motion settings I was able to get the results I needed. At one point the wind blew leaves across my driveway and my sensor went off. After fine tuning I see no issues with the camera and its performance. It is by far better than other cameras I have purchase over the years and after comparing subscriptions from other companies $10 a month or $100 is a deal.,Don’t let any negative reviews influence your decision to buy these cameras. The negative reviews are from people who have not read the instructions or just have no idea how a security camera works. I monitor 16 security cameras where I work so I have a lot of experience with them. I bought the Ring Stick up camera and the solar charger for it as well. They both work great. I bought two more a week later. Now a month later I have no issues with battery power loss of any kind. Just set your zones to cover what you want. Don’t put motion sensor on full or you will catch bugs and falling leaves. I set my sensitivity in the middle. The image quality day and night is pretty good. You can also look at your cameras from a computer as well as your phone. You don’t need an Alexa to use these. The microphone works well too. Overall I would highly recommend these if you just read and understand the instructions and how they work which is very simple and easy.MD in SC 1-1-21,35984,1,https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Stick-Up-Cam-Battery-HD-security-camera-with-two-way-talk-Works-with-Alexa-/dp/B07Q6ZZFLS/ref=sr_1_10_sspa?keywords=ring+outdoor+security+camera&qid=1640229711&sr=8-10-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExNFFVSDVWTjMzSk01JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDI1MzEyMlQwRVQ5UEVOWkJUUyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNzI2ODQyMks1TFUxVDFUVU5PJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

The reason I opted for the wired version was I don’t like messing with batteries, however if I were to buy the battery version I’d buy the second battery pack to eliminate down time. The wired version is nice as your getting constant power. Then camera also starts recording motion faster with the wired version versus the battery version.Setup: super simple follow Ring app instructions and you’ll be up in running in 10 mins or lessInstall: I live in Nevada land of stucco homes so it takes a little longer to drill holes and place anchors. The ring mounting bracket comes with a level built in to make install easy “Pro tip I learned from my door bell” once you have the mounting bracket level I used a thin nail to start and mark my pilot holes for when I had to drill, which made the install even easier. Once you have the holes drilled anchors in installing is a breeze. The most time consuming part well for me as I’m OCD is space the holes for the cable clips. Overall the physical installation took 20 mins do to me being OCC. the cable is paintable to match your house. My stucco is white so it was a non issue.Functionality: in order for Ring,Arlo,Nest ect to work properly will require good WiFi and a good router. All these web based on demand cams require good WiFi if your WiFi or router isn’t up to par you’ll have a bad experience. I run a NetGear Night Hawk Router that I can pick up WiFi halfway down my street so no range extender needed for me. If you have a big house and your router is on the opposite side of the house from your cameras either buy the chime pro extender or better yet by a mesh WiFi like EERO or Orbi or googles mesh routers “you’ll thank me” the better WiFi signal the better your devices will operate.The App: The Ring App is super easy and user friendly and about to get even better here with new updates and usability. The app allows you to manually turn the lights on and off sound the siren create customized motion areas “a feature the battery version doesn’t do” as well as set the motion distance for the lights to come on. While reviewing a motion activity or in live view you have the option to turn the lights on or off as well as sound the siren. The app also keeps you informed of any issues with Rings servers or any downtime or issues with devices. The Ring cloud service is outstanding and it’s very reasonably priced at $3 a month which is cheap. I don’t need 24/7 video I only need motion events so $3 a month is a great value. The motion or activity alerts are fast and show up on your phone quickly. The two way communication is nice and clear to tell would be questionable people to buzz off if not the alarm will scare them away and wake your neighbors.Overall I am very satisfied with my Spotlight cam wired and my ring doorbell and plan to add more ring devices very soon, with the upcoming software updates from ring the experience is going to get even better. Again I can’t reiterate enough you have to have good WiFi and router for this device or any of the competitors devices to work properly. I’m a very very picky person with electronics and can say Ring Spot light cam wired met and exceeded my expectations.The neighborhoods feature within the app is also a great tool to keep you informed of activity or events within your community. Again I highly recommend this product",,"I have 4 ring Floodlight cameras in use at another property. I really like them so I was excited to see the new Spotlight camera added to the ring lineup. I tried the ring Stick Up Cam Solar prior to ordering the Spotlight and I ultimately returned it due to being spoiled by the better build quality and overall camera quality of the Floodlight Cam. I included photos to show the field of view comparison between the two. While they aren’t installed in the exact same location, you can see just how much better the Spotlight Cam looks. As expected, the light output is greater on the Floodlight Cam but the Spotlight Cam does a good job of lighting up the immediate area around the unit. After installing and using my first Spotlight camera, I promptly ordered a second and installed it as soon as it came in. Both have been operating as expected. The camera video quality is great, the field of view is awesome. I have already influenced at least one friend to buy a wired Spotlight Cam and he is just as happy with it. I do wish that ring would add some more customization to their iOS app. It would be great to be able to reorder the cameras in any order you want vs left to right based on order of set up. It would also be nice to know if the motion detector triggered the lights or if the lights are on for extended periods without having to open the app. I found that after losing power at one property while not there that the lights stayed on after power was restored. I just happened to notice they were on when I was in the app and had to manually turn them off. HomeKit compatibility would rock too! Anyway, the Spotlight Cam is great! Way to go Ring!",,,9137,1,https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Spotlight-Cam-Wired-Plugged/dp/B0756P26HL/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=ring+outdoor+security+camera&qid=1640229711&sr=8-9

I've wasted 2 years on an Azone Camera System that is trash(their customer service is trash too). I installed and had this up and running in 30 minutes. Super loud alarm. Super clear picture, legit covers 180 degree area great. Now I have a peace of mind from my neighbors. The app is really cool because it tells you all of the recent crimes in your area along with all controls is through your phone. Thank you for selling a quality system.","Clear video, motion detection works very good. It actually honors the zones you set. Light comes on when motion is detected as expected. Great camera.","This was very easy to install! We took down our regular flood lights, put this up. Ten minutes max. The picture is awesome and so very clear. I also have the original ring doorbell and there’s an obvious picture quality difference.The siren isn’t terribly loud, not like wake your neighbors loud. I set the motion boundaries and it picks up to the very line. It picked up the reflection of light on the window from my neighbors cell phone as he walked past his car last night. In his driveway.I tethered it to my doorbell so when one sees motion, they both start recording. The daytime visual range is from the ceiling of my carport to about a foot above the driveway, up against the wall it’s mounted on. It sees my entire driveway (2 wide, 3 deep), entire yard, and part of the neighbors yard. These are old-school large yards. The zoom can clearly see a persons face sitting in the car in the driveway. It lights up my whole driveway. So far, I highly recommend buying one, or five.","Crisp image. Love the Ring app. It allows you to adjust the motion detection area. The first few hours after it was installed, I was getting notifications every time a car drove by. I setup the detection zone and it’s been great since. I also like how it links to the other cameras whenever motion is detected.",8008,560,https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Refurbished-Floodlight-Cam-White/dp/B07GTG17W1/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=ring+outdoor+security+camera&qid=1640229711&sr=8-8

Amazing Quality, Excellent Night Vision",Way cheaper then a security system alarm and in some ways better.,Better than Nest!,Love these cameras!,Great security cameras!,"WOW! Highly impressed. We purchased these cameras to install outside our house for that added protection of audio and video surveillance.The video/picture/audio quality are great! I haven't experienced any issues at all with quality! The night vision is by far the greatest I have seen in wireless cameras. The night vision has perfect clarity and no distortion at all! It works just as good at night as it does in day light.The motion detection works really well for us. We went through the initial setup and chose the preferences that worked best for what we were wanting. You can even set zones so you don't have any unnecessary recordings or alerts!The battery life is also really good, like crazy good, at least for us anyway. They last about 3 to 4 months. What we have done is kept a backup battery that is fully charged for each device, that way when we charge the batteries, we don't have to worry about any of our Ring Devices not working.The Cams integrate flawlessly with Alexa as do all Ring Products. I have seen the quality of other Ring competitors and they don't stand up even close to the quality that the Ring Cameras or other Ring Products produce.If you are looking for great quality, and a product to perform as it is intended to do, then look no further than Ring. Ring truly does live up to it's expectations!","For the price you can’t beat what you are getting. Wide angle shot, motion sensor activation, and the battery life is unreal.Bought two of these and a wired doorbell camera during Amazon Prime Day sale and we are beyond impressed. We have an alarm system and the install fee alone to hook into the system was more than 10 times the cost of the two pack of cameras.Pros:Battery life in unreal. We can hook up a solar charger but why? The one gets a lot of motion and we charged it for the first time after 4 months at 18% battery life. The other gets motion but not really that much and we charged for the first time after 7 months at 6%.Notifications in your phone. Could be better. Almost instant, but you aren’t going to be able to catch the delivery man and the video takes 30-60 second to load. But it is on a continuous loop so it shows about 4-5 seconds before the motion sets it off.Live view is great. Awesome picture day and night. Easy to watch the kids playing outside or keep an eye out for the delivery man. Can’t keep it on all the time but for a few seconds it’s good. You don’t need to be on your network to watch who’s there.Support (we bought ring protect) chat and call options we had a connection problem and they were amazing on the phone and fixed it within 4 mins of making the call. Best part is if someone steals the camera they will replace it under the ring protect.ConsUnless someone rings the doorbell you aren’t going to catch the delivery man. It’s just a hair too slow.Wireless signal has to be decent for it to work. You may need a repeater or extender. And by decent I don’t mean awesome but if you can get on the internet on your phone in that spot the camera will work.Pro and con - Zeroing in the motion sensor takes a little time. Everything can set this off till you get it zeroed in, but once you do it will pick up only what you want to see. It can tell humans from animals so it doesn't kill the battery. For instance out doorbell is wired so we have a liberal motion setting. Instead of the cat that runs past the door at 4:30 am it was two cat sized raccoons!!!!Overall 8 months in we are impressed and are going to add two more of these bad boys. The ring protect insurance will cover all of them for one price so I am not worried about longevity but think that it shouldn’t be an issue.I rated motion detection at 4 but it’s more like 4.5 only because it really is annoying until you get it dialed in...","2 years ago my wife came home from work and I told her to come look. I was on our Nest Camera dashboard. As we watched, a car turned into our driveway. She asked,""Who is that?"" I told her, ""Its you, 1 minute and 23 seconds ago."" Due to the delay of the Nest server and since we had a new Ring Doorbell I went Ring Solar for outdoors.BEST CHOICE EVER!! We live in the High Desert where there is PLENTY OF SUN and I have 3 Ring Solar Outdoor cameras and and a Ring doorbell.Love them so much,I just ordered 3 more and a lighted Ring sign directly from RING because of the 1 camera limit here on Amazon plus they were cheaper directly from RING which BTW is owned by Amazon.I set all my cameras to detect ""persons only"" around my yard and set the range to the edged of my driveway because I don't need passing car motion alerts or alerts when our dogs are out to potty.With solar lights on every fence panel from https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XJHND3T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and solar lights on the front entry, driveway and gate entries from here https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XNS4SV1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1Our home and property says ""Go break into somebody else's house, we're protected!!",These Ring cameras were perfect for our shops security system. I was able to easily download the app on my i phone and get notifications when motion is detected-I can also snooze the alarm if I know someone will be walking around the area for a while so my phone isn't constantly going off. I charged them the first day about a month ago and have not had to charge the battery yet which I was worried about originally. Great picture and recording quality. I am able to talk to my dad through the speaker when he's at work later than he should be and tell him to go home hehe. I like being able to watch and make sure my father who is getting older is okay when he gets to work before we open and stays well past when we close. It also helps me to know when a customer comes in the front door if I am in the back helping the technicians. It also connected to my apple watch so I am able to get notifications that way as well. I am considering buying them for my house because I love them so much. I have also checked the photo quality at night time and it's pretty darn clear-I'd definitely recommend this camera.,"I got these to replace some cheapo $40 cameras I had bought from Amazon. They were ok and did the job but I just wasn't that happy with them. I was looking at going with Nest but they are just crazy expensive, $200 or more per camera?!?! I had four cameras total and that was still $40 cheaper than just one Nest cam. But, you do get what you pay for. Those took forever to connect on the app, their desktop app didn't even work at all and were powered by USB ( at least the ones inside) which made me have to use an extension cable and have ugly cables going everywhere. I thought I'd give these cameras a try since they were battery powered. I was a little concerned since they weren't recording 24/7 but after actually using them, it's not that big of a deal. The motion detection works pretty good and the fact that you can view live video almost instantly is great (the cheapo cameras took FOREVER to connect). Plus, the video quality and field of view is fantastic. I'm sure the more expensive cameras probably have a better field of view but honestly, these are great for the money. I am extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend this camera if you're looking for the middle ground camera (better than the cheap Chinese cameras but not as expensive as those $250+ cameras), also has the benefit of being wireless. Oh and on that, I've had them installed with some pretty heaving motion detection and have gone down only 6% for the cameras outside over two weeks and the inside cameras 10% (a lot more activity).",6143,183,https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Stick-Up-Cam-Battery-HD-security-camera-with-two-way-talk-Works-with-Alexa-2-Pack/dp/B07RM5BVVR/ref=sr_1_21_sspa?keywords=ring+outdoor+security+camera&qid=1640229711&sr=8-21-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExNFFVSDVWTjMzSk01JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUExMDI1MzEyMlQwRVQ5UEVOWkJUUyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODgxNTUyM0tGUTZIVEQzNUNPSSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2J0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

I had to move it as it was picking up my neighbors driveway and I did not feel right about that. The optional solar charger that powers the battery made it VERY easy to move without moving the panel. I feel great about the product and I rely on it. I wish it was a bit easier to change the wireless network but I do understand they are taking proactive measures against people using products wrong. I put this on a hidden guest network and I am thrilled at how it works. The timeline recording features are a huge perk and I am VERY happy as it even showed me an essential situation I needed to share with a third party and it was so easy to share the data.My only suggestion to RING is that you have to make it easier to ask questions about policies. I have the warranty on the device and coverage. My question did not get answered clearly and I asked for clarification and I was dropped. My main alarm is a start of the year coverage. My new lights I got late in Q3/Q4. I asked how does the coverage get applied to keep it one date and they failed to clearly answer that. I searched and found the answer on Amazon and solved my concern, however that's Ring's job, not Amazon.","• Overview: The Ring Spotlight Camera (Battery) is a remarkable security product that offers peace of mind and simplicity to protect your property. The camera offers what I have found to be very impressive video quality (1080p) that looks fantastic on both mobile devices and computers, perfect two-way audio, a very bright LED light, and alerting 110 decibel alarm – THE FULL PACKAGE in my opinion. All features of this product are cloud based and accessible from the comfort of where YOU are, via internet connect on the Ring app or website.The Ring rechargeable battery is a truly incredible product and delivers an industry leading design, efficiency, and fulfillment of expectations. Although proprietary to Ring products, the rechargeable battery offers the perfect solution to those who may not have access to a permanent power solution, solar, or stable power connection. I have purchased nine (9) additional rechargeable batteries, leaving me with an total of 20 of these. In most cases, one would expect the purchase of additional batteries to be the result of poor performance and longevity; however, these fit my exact demand of two (2) batteries per spotlight camera and one (1) to keep charged on hand for my Ring Video Doorbell 2. ALL of these batteries have held a phenomenal charge in the brutal summer heats of Arizona (100-110 degrees currently) with very frequent usage through each day. It is important that consumers know mileage will vary with the battery of any Ring products as there are both sensitivity and frequency settings to capture the moments you otherwise would not.• What I loved: There is so much to take into consideration when purchasing a security camera and for me this really checked every box. The installation process is seamless, as one would expect as Ring includes EVERYTHING necessary for you to install the product with ease. This is even to include easy to follow video demonstration of how the device is set up, installed, and even the functionalities. The lights and alarm add an additional layer to prevention that I thought I would never need, and hopefully never do, but am relieved that I have. The video playback is perfect, although, internet service is going to vary for everyone. I have purchased Ring products for all of my immediate family members, and for those who have slower internet connection or poor WiFi there is noticeable differences between Live View functionality.The proprietary battery is very well construction, durable, and fits perfectly into each Ring battery operated product. I have not ran into any issues or failures. The battery charges via micro usb in approximately 6 hours from 0% battery. In a world of fast charging devices, this may seem extremely long; however, consumers should consider that these batteries will last days, if not weeks, of consistent recording, live view, and other events.• Opportunities: I would like to see a proprietary charging dock that can charge multiple batteries at once.","These are great for peace of mind. I did have to get a stronger wifi connection, but it makes sense, as we placed one camera as far from the router as possible.I love that I can pull up the camera on my app. The sound is great. I love the two-way talk option. Our front camera battery does need charging every 5-7 days, but I have it to the max sensitivity, and we're across from a decently busy street end. The backyard camera has been about 2 weeks between charging.You do need a special drill to install on brick, but it's an easy setup.","Works great at detecting motion. Good fisheye and distance in light, less distance about 50-70 feet at night. Love that I can turn on light and talk through camera. (Make sure you do 2-factor security) Got 30 day free trial. I have outdoor with a non-Ring solar panel, using one battery. Never runs out. I had to get a range extender because my router is central in the house. even with a range extender it is skipping at times. I wish this model had an antenna built in or at least when connected to the solar panel used the connection as an antenna.","A snap to install, and connect to my existing Ring setup. These two cameras provide outstanding coverage for two backyard gates on either end of the house. Installed now for almost two months in triple digit Arizona heat, and a couple of fierce monsoon storms, and holding up extremely well. (I did instill them under eaves to partially protect them). So far, very happy with battery life as well. Was worried they would go through the battery quickly, but after almost two months on the job, showing 75% and 78% charge on the two units.

Sadly this is not the case. As noted in many reviews before me, the image quality and sharpness is just terrible. It looks as if I’m looking at a 480p image from my old Arlos. The color is also over saturated. Sad that I was expecting at least similar if not better image quality but this is a major step back. Perhaps it’s addressable via firmware update but you can’t enhance the physical sensor.UPDATE 6/26/2021: After talking w/ a super nice representative (Nicole) from Ring, it turns out my Spotlight Cam was swapping between WiFi Router and extender, and that the poor bandwidth was dropping the frame to 360p. I've adjusted my Router's antennas direction a bit and will likely swap out for a mesh system, as suggested and it's helped to keep a stable lock to get the 1080p quality.Kudos to the Ring team for their timely and superb customer service in helping me troubleshoot the issue. They also said they'd be rolling out a new firmware update that can enhance the image quality, though no exact details on how. Changed review from 2 stars to 5 stars.","The installation was very easy and the instructions are updated for installing on an eave (which is where I installed mine). After about 30 minutes I had the unit up and running. It syncs well with Alexa, provides quality video, and I tested the audio with my family who stated it was loud and clear.The siren might not be crazy loud, but it will definitely get the attention of anyone in the area.The lights are bright and seem to cover as much area as you’d expect from a flood light.Motion detection is as good as we all expect from a Ring product and I haven’t experienced any missed movements.WiFi signal is stable and I appreciate the 5g capability.My only complaint is the box did not include any “Do not switch off” stickers, which were included in the previous model. Not a huge deal, but that was a nice little addition from Ring in cases where a switch controls the unit’s power supply.Overall it’s a great camera that is doing everything it’s made to do and doing it well.","I have no clue why there are bad reviews about quality of picture and sound. I have the old one and the new one, the new one is ten times better than the older version. Quality of picture is better, the sound is soo much better, you can actually hear with out all that background noise. I think people just don’t have the best internet speeds and don’t understand the importance of such when it comes to audio and video. Ignore the bad reviews, buy this product you won’t be disappointed.",I would highly recommend the ring flood light camera. The lights alone are so bright at 1600 lumens alone!! The camera quality is great. The coverage is great. I use it out front of my garage doors for my driveway and then my ring doorbell links and it’s full front yard/driveway coverage! I got the black one and it blends so nice against my grey vinyl siding. I almost couldn’t tell it was there when my handyman installed it. He hooked it up to an extension cord and ran it on the ceiling of the garage and plugged it into an electrical outlet that I also use for the garage door opener. It works awesome that way of you aren’t replacing an existing fixture. So some options that are a little easier then wiring to the panel box. I’m glad I have it and wish I would of had it sooner!!!!!! Hands down best product. I think it has more coverage then the spot cameras too. And limits the number of devices you need depending on desired coverage areas and setup you have at home or your business!,This floodlight cam is everything I hoped it would be. Works great and easy to set up. I liked it enough to buy a second one,1218,77,https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Floodlight-Cam-Wired-Pro/dp/B08FCWRXQR/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=ring+security+camera&qid=1640229493&sr=8-16

INSTALLED QUICK. UP N RUNNING IN 10-15 MINUTES FOR AN OUTSIDE INSTALL. UPDATED 10-31-19. I LOVE THE RING SYSTEM, ONE THINK IS AN OUTSIDE CAM I PUT UP WAS A BIT AWAY FROM THE ROUTER, IT SHOWED WEAK SIGNAL THEN WOULD NOT WORK, FOUND THIS OUT FROM A CALL I DID TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, THE LADY WAS SPOT ON IN FINDING MY ISSUE. I PURCHASED A RING CHIME WIFI BOOSTER, NOW NO ISSUES. GREAT SYSTEM.","***update*** changed to 5 star, if you set the camera to battery mode and then plug in the power outlet, it keeps the battery charged at 100% allowing the camera to use hardwire and battery power for backup in the event power is cut. This works as I intended, just need to figure out the setting*** Descent camera, but I am a little frustrated at a couple things. First, the inside camera allows you to mount upside down and then flip the camera view in the app. This was my install plan with the outside cam, but the outside cams do not offer the video invert option in the app. They claim this is for motion sensing issues, but I suspect it is so they can sell you the additional top mount. The biggest issue I have is that the stick up cams can be used with battery or plug in, so I bought the extra batteries thinking they would charge when the power supply was plugged in (nope) and that they would work as a back-up power supply if power is lost (also nope) the batteries have to be removed to charge and you have to manually switch between battery power or power supply within the app. I basically wasted $40 on batteries I’ll never use. I have an outside outlet on a timer I use for Xmas lights and I wanted to use the same outlet for the camera thinking when the timer kicked off the battery would kick in keeping the camera live, nope, camera will not automatically revert to battery backup. Apparently they just made it so they can sell the same camera as either battery or power supply.. no point in having both without them working together and being automated, which is not the case. I also tried to research this before purchasing the batteries and I could not get a clear answer anywhere which I think is intentional. Otherwise this camera is as advertised, works well, picture and night vision are good and other features seem to work as described. Setup was easy.","Bought this after learning about do-it-yourself security cameras. This Ring Stick up indoor outdoor security camera is a good quality security for $99. Firstly, I went to a geek tech store and bought a security cameras set and was completely disappointed with my experience and the marked up prices. This camera is very easy to install yourself. The picture quality is great. The App is easy to navigate and for $99 you can see what’s happening in front of your property when you are away and added security when you are home. I recommend using the Ring stick up plug in security camera....comes with an 8ft and 22ft cord 30ft total... if you can drill a hole on the exterior to the inside of your home to reach a electrical outlet to plug this device in that is the best option without the hassle of recharging batteries. I tried the recharge battery mode and did not like it but if you do go the battery route make sure you get the correct solar panel (called Ring Super Solar Panel) that will help the battery life. I understand some people can’t drill holes where they live and recharging battery mode with a solar panel is an ideal option for some. Hope this was helpful.","This is my third Ring camera (door bell, inside camera and now this outside camera), and I have become sold on Ring products. This stick-up plug-in outside camera exceeded my expectations. I mounted it on the side of the house under the eaves. Physical mounting was very easy, and the cord was long enough to reach through the eaves to an outlet in the attic without needing an extension cord. The ball-and-socket joint in the mount allowed sufficient angle adjustment that I didn't need a separate mounting bracket. The angle of coverage is generous, the image is crisp, and the Infrared night vision is incredible. It's easy to connect to WiFi, although be advised: when first connecting, it upgrades the software and tells you it could take up to 5 minutes. Mine took 10-15 minutes with a high-speed router, so be patient. There is also a wide range of parameters for the camera you can set with the Ring app, making it even more versatile. I highly recommend it.","I purchased the 2 Pack of the Ring Stick Up Camera Plug-In, but I have only put up one of them at this point (long story). However, I wanted to write this review because I felt doing so might help some others trying to decide if they should buy Ring or not. First thing I have to say that when you receive something from Ring the packaging screams quality. No cheap of flimsy box; everything that is in the package is well protected and yet easy to get out.Before I installed the camera I ordered a battery for backup. After installing the battery I set the camera up following the directions. The Ring android app made it extremely easy to get the camera connected to my network. Once that was done I took the camera outside and found the location where I wanted to install it based on the area of view I wanted covered. By the way, I did order one of the Ring ceiling mounts for it, but the more I looked at the area I wanted it to cover the more I realized that I could use the mount that came with the camera.There is a single screw that holds the stand on. I removed it and moved the stand/mount to the back of the camera. In order to do this you do have to removed a weather seal where the mount needs to be placed; be sure to put the weather seal in the bottom of the camera where the stand/mount was located. It is easy to do, after removing the seal just place stand/mount in the hole, put the screw back in place and you are done. Took me less than a minute. I then marked the location where the detachable part of the mount need to go, drilled a couple of pilot holes, put the screws in and the base of the mount was in place. Snapped the camera into it and put in the security screw. After getting it mounted I plugged it in and it came right up. Used my phone to view and adjust it to cover the area I wanted covered and I was finished with mounting it. Probably took me a total of 10 minutes.So, how does it work? Great. Since I already had the app open I went to the setting menu and turned on the Record Motion and Motion Alerts feature. I turned on Motion Verification and set the Motion Zones the way I wanted them. I then set the Motion Detection and I was done with the setup.The camera has been up for 3 weeks now without any false motion notification, which is a great thing. My wife and I have looked at it quite often. It comes up quickly and the image is great for a security camera. If a friend or family member asked me if I would recommend it, my answer would be absolutely.The things that stand out in my mind are:1. The quality of the packaging, but more importantly the quality of the product itself.2. The ease of installation.3. The features and function of the app and the camera.4. The fact that I don't get false alerts, but at the same time it does alert me when it should.5. Ease of use.",6606,303,https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Stick-Up-Cam-Plug-In-HD-security-camera-with-two-way-talk-Works-with-Alexa-/dp/B07RGSG4TN/ref=sr_1_17?keywords=ring+security+camera&qid=1640229493&sr=8-17

With the new indoor cam I can now access all my cams from one app. To me the picture quality is great overall and especially in total darkness. Live view connection is a lot more stable than my Wyze cams. Alexa integration is a big plus, no need for third party hacks to complete routines. Because I already have Ring cameras it’s worth it to pay a little more over a Wyze cam.","In February, I noticed my ADHD medication ran out early. I’m very careful about taking it exactly as prescribed so it was strange that I had run out 10 days early. For reasons I won’t get into for this review, I suspected the property manager of my building was stealing it. Obviously that sounded crazy, but I couldn’t think of another explanation. A friend suggested a Ring camera, so I bought one never expecting anything to actually come of it. I put some antihistamines in my now empty pill bottle thinking no one would ever take them, set up the camera when it arrived, and felt more secure knowing it was there. Set up was simple so I figured worst case scenario, I was out a bit of money and I spent maybe 10 minutes setting it up.Fast forward a week later when I get a notification via the app that there was motion detected on my camera. I open up the recording and there she is, entering my apartment, going right for my decoy pills, taking them, and leaving. I immediately left work to get back home. I called the police who sent an officer. I showed him the video and he admitted that had I not had the video, he wouldn’t have believed me. I was able to quickly and easily send the video to the police and to the president of the company that owns my building. I also was able to download the video and get it uploaded so that I have copies of it as I go through the next few months as she (hopefully) gets brought to justice.I cannot emphasize how much this little camera has helped me. I would not have caught my burglar otherwise. Because of it, they were able to look up records of who used their electronic key to access my apartment and she had been in there 7 times over the month prior. This would have gone on for longer and who knows if it would have resulted in harm to myself or my cat had I not caught her. This camera has given some of the sense of security she stole from me back and stopped a nightmare situation from worsening. I will still be recovering from this for long time and I am hoping she is brought to justice, but I cannot thank Ring enough for helping me secure my home from an unexpected source of danger.","This camera for $60 is a solid deal.

I got a crisp and clear video, posted to the Ring app, other neighbors checked their video and found the same man on their property, the police were involved immediately and the perp was taken back to jail.From the press release of our local PD:""On 5/11/20, [city] Police Department Patrol responded to a residential burglary that occurred the night before. The victim had left their garage door open and went for a walk around the neighborhood. During that time, from about 8 pm to 8:30 pm, an unknown subject later identified as [nam,e] entered the garage, rummaged through the cars and stole the victim’s mountain bike. While [name] was in the garage, the victim’s family was at home in the house....When the victim realized his bike had been stolen, he checked his Ring Camera video and saw that the suspect had been inside his garage. He posted the video onto the Ring Camera Neighborhood App, warning others in the area.Many community members had seen the video of the suspect and had been in contact with the [city] Police Street Crimes Unit (SCU).

[name] is currently on PROS/AB109 and was in custody and had recently been released from jail on May 8th by Probation due to Covid-19 concerns.""For a $60 camera, this was a great investment.Original Review----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I had 5 of the Amazon Cloud Cams, purchased about 18 months ago. Amazon then acquired Ring and Blink, and discontinued the Cloud Cams, although they still provide support (for now).I needed two new cameras, so I went with the Ring. Primarily because I heard nothing negative about the security, as opposed to Wyze. However, Ring has some real downsides relative to the Amazon Cloud Cams.1. More latency.I have great WiFi. I have multiple wi-fi mesh routers throughout the house with no dead spots. Still have to wait ~5-7 seconds to connect to live view. Cloud Cams was 3-5 seconds.2. No zoomI could tap and zoom on Cloud Cams. Can't do that with Ring.3. No live view via Web Browser.Apparently you can download an app on Windows 10, but I'm on a Mac and wonder why I can't view the video in a browser. I could go with Cloud Cams.4. I can't see multiple Cameras at once.With Cloud Cam, I could stream audio and video from all five cameras at once over the web. It was great. Having to switch between cameras, one at a time, and having to wait 5-7 seconds per camera, is a big downside.I get that Amazon needed to simplify its product portfolio after their two most recent acquisitions in this space, but it's a shame the Cloud Cam isn't sold anymore. It was a superior product offering in this space.Design, Packaging, Ease of Setup, and from what I can understand, Security is all excellent in Ring, and I have no complaints. The app, in spite of the one camera at a time limitation, is well-designed too.*** UPDATED 3-Jan-2020 ***I found the Rapid Ring app. It works in conjunction with the regular Ring app. Rapid Ring has limited functionality, but it does everything I need. Somehow, it manages to reduce latency to connect to the cameras. When I pull up the Rapid Ring app, I can connect to anyone of my cameras in <1 second. The app will also continuously reconnect to the camera after the 5 minute timeout period, so I can stream a camera indefinitely. I have upgraded my review to 4 stars. If Ring ever develops a generic web interface to view all cameras simultaneously, I will give 5 stars.","The video on these cams is amazing, I am comparing the performance to previous Ring Cam models, this is the best so far. Really crisp even when zooming the content of the video. Responsive, immediately playing the live video when requested. I am tickled pink with these Inside Stick Up Cams, will recommended to all over other brands. I have replaced two of my three Wyze Cams with these Ring Inside Stick Up Cams, well worth the added expense.I have at this time, the first generation Stick Up Cams (outside and in the garage), Pro Door Bell and two Ring Spot Light Cams (one wired and one battery powered), all are in excellent working order. The video on these Inside Stick Up Cams exceeds expectations in comparison with my existing Ring cameras.Inside I had three Wyze Cams, one that was chronically loosing itself from the network, another two that intermittently would loose themselves from the network. All were chronically unable to provide a video within the app without crashing or without taking valuable time to do so. My internet is very, very stout, throughput is excellent, download of 500+ Mpbs's and upload at over 30+ Mpbs's. So internet speed, latency and throughput are not the issue where any of these camera's are concerned. My decision to replace these Wyze Cams with the Ring Stick Up Cams is well founded, I am quite pleased.","I purchased the ring doorbell and two indoor camera one of which I actually turned outward to capture the driveway. I think functionality, resolution, and being able to access recorded video is all I could ask for. And all at a very reasonable price!Settings options are ample for things like motion zone adjustment , upside down camera placement with adjusted view on the receiver, and even a night glare adjustment if you choose to have an indoor camera face outward.Important to note that after a 30 day trial of free access to video recording, if you want continued access to recordings, it’s $3/month per camera for the basic plan or $10/month for all cameras - obviously makes sense to do if you have more than 3 cameras.I added two 10ft power cords in case either do the cameras placement was too far from an outlet for the cord that comes with the camera (I think it’s 6 or 7ft). Actually just moved one of the cameras and needed the longer cord which I had.Another great thing is that I can set up the app on multiple devices.https://smarthomestarter.com/can-you-install-ring-doorbell-without-turning-off-the-power/I decided on the Ring Doorbell Pro so I don’t have to deal with a battery powered device. The Pro model gets wired directly into where your doorbell is wired into so make sure to cut the power supply first! Also the Pro offers a chime you cam plug into a desired place to hear the doorbell","The RING indoor camera were very easy to mount and activate on my WiFi network. These camera have been integrated into a wide array of SmartHome devices to monitor infrastructure and security. While my Weil-McLain hot water boiler for hydronic radiant floor heat is capable of providing information on its operating status, it does not have the ability to notify me when an error message is generated. Using the RING Indoor cam, I can monitor the backlit screen of the boiler from anywhere in the world via an internet connection and the RING app (picture #1 is a screen shot from the RING app). I can control my garage doors remotely by internet connection and do receive open/close status via e-Mail, but wanted visual confirmation of door status especially if I gave someone remote access and wanted to make sure they closed the door after leaving. With a RING camera ceiling mounted in the garage, the wide field of view (picture #3 is screen shot of garage from RING app) allows monitoring of both doors. RING sells a longer power cable that eliminated the need for an extension cord to provide power. A tilt/swivel mount allows for optimized viewing angles. The mount can be easily configured for ceiling or wall mounting. The camera has a sensitive speaker/microphone. The RING app is easy to use for configuring range and sensitivity of motion as well as viewing with an adequate WiFi signal. My Router is at the opposite end of the house from the garage location and the other camera is in the basement-no problem quickly connecting to both cameras.","Let me start by saying I received no compensation of any kind for this review; it is my honest experience with Ring products. I am a senior, living alone, in a single family home. Security is a big concern for me but I could not afford any longer to pay the outrageous cost of ADT. My neighbors recommended Ring doorbells. I bought those first. I also needed something that would cover the outside of my home, my yard and driveway. I bought this set of 2 Ring indoor cameras. I installed them yesterday in less than 15 minutes with them sitting in window sills but pointed OUTWARD. They are just perfect!!! Because I live in Iowa with very harsh winters, I did not want to have to worry about changing batteries or a solar powered camera. These 2 little cameras plug into to any outlet and the view outside is absolutely clear. I highly recommend them for reasonable cost, ease of installation and for the ability to monitor the entire outside of my home without expensive installation charges.",12496,524,https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Ring-Indoor-Cam-Compact-Plug-In-HD-security-camera-with-two-way-talk-White-Works-with-Alexa-2-Pack/dp/B07RM6922G/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=ring+security+camera&qid=1640229493&sr=8-18

Works well for the backyard.,Wireless Freedom - Ring Cam Battery,"New Camera, New Update!!","I have a Ring pro on my front door and loved it so much that I wanted something for the back patio since I have contracts (lawn, pool, trees, etc) in my backyard. My challenge however is that all the walls on the patio are either stucco or rock, which makes it near impossible to run a hidden power line. So I opted for this option and so far it works great. The lights are pretty bright and the motion detection works as expected.As for the battery life, it has been in for a couple weeks and it has lost about 10% battery. So I’m guessing it will last about 3 months before it needs a charge. I just ordered a second battery which should double that battery life.The connection is very quick, it seems to connect much faster than my front door, but in fairness it is closer to the wireless router.As for installation, I installed it using the provided screws into the frame of my patio door. It actually works perfect there because you can’t really see it and allows me to perfectly position it for motion detection.My only complaint is the motion zone setup. Unlike the ring pro where I can “draw” motion zones (which significantly helps reduce motion alerts), it only allows you to specify a distance. It really isn’t very intuitive, so I just leave it at mid-range and it seems to work just fine for now.Beware, in order to have video playback, you do have to subscribe to the ring premium service. And you have to have a subscription per device! I have it for my front door, not sure I’m gonna pay for the back door. That was kind of a bummer to find out I’d have to pay more. It should be a household subscription.Overall, I’m very happy with the device and would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to install solution without wires.",,We have this camera for the backyard and also the ring doorbell for the front door. We got the doorbell first and think it does the job. It is not the best nor is it the worst. Now the camera for the backyard is very nice. We got it as a safety precaution because we felt someone had used the pool while we were away and did not want that to be a safety issue. As you can see in these live pictures I just took that it covers pretty much the whole yard and you can zoom into areas on the app with your finger. Also pictured. We have the sensor set Just right to capture the movement in the backyard. At night when motion is detected the lights fire up to record. There is also an option to push an alarm on the light. It’s not super loud but loud enough for the neighbors to hear and scare persons away. I have also included a screenshot of the app view of the ring items we have.I would recommend this camera but really recommend using the solar panel with the camera and not have to worry about taking the battery out to charge it.,"Love the freedom of wireless, the solar panels work great and only need a couple of hours of sunlight per day to keep the batteries topped off. Video quality is great and I've got eyes on the whole yard now. Just picked up 3 of these beauties. Simply system anyone can install and operate. Thank You Ring!!I bought a camera system a few years ago with a hard drive a 4 wired cameras. Wires all over the house and you need a PHD in programming to get the system to work. It ended up in the trash without ever making a single recording. Ring just makes it all doable for the average Non PHD humans...","Updated Review:Received a new camera from Ring. Setup this past weekend and it has been great so far. A lot different and better results from my first go with Ring.I had upgraded my network devices, modem and router. No more drops or freezing.

I filed a police report and purchased a full blink system and added two of these 360 cams. To my delight, these work with my new Alexa equipped home and I can view all cams with my echo. I will be adding the smaller version for indoor to add to my system. I really wanted a CCTV system so I can run it around the clock...just didn't want to deal with the time it would have taken to wire it up so I opted for my current setup. It's a nice blend of battery powered cams and two of these powered devices cutting the setup time since I wanted security much sooner than later. One of the drawbacks with blink is that you are only able to record up to 5 min at a time. They are great cams for catching things as it happens but these 360 cams really surprised me with the fact that I've had them running and recording for the past 12 hours straight. They are fully automated and I smirked every time the camera tracked anything that moved lol. They always reverted back to point of origin which is awesome since monitoring a specific area is important to me. With my Samsung connected to my computer, I'm able to watch my blind spots without touching my phone. I wanted to close with how impressed I am with the quality of the recording. Very confident that with these cams and my blink system, any unlawful actions will be caught on cam which will be key to pressing charges. If you are on the fence, don't be. This is security at a very very reasonable price point :)Update: 10-11-21Pro...err n00b tip since I'm also learning :)The software will record 24/7 as long as you have Smart Scene set up. I have mine set to ""Tap Perform to start..."" and then the action is ""Record Video"". I named this Smart Scene as 24/7 Cam. Now you can have multiple Smart Scenes set up and I have this one combined with Scene's that record when motion isdetected. So while you are recording a 24/7 clip, the camera will still record separate videos anytime the motion is detected. This comes in handy so that you don't have to sit there and watch the full 24 hour video since the motion detected videos are saved in another folder. You will have to click record to activate the 24/7 recording and I would suggest clicking on the ""Pop-out picture in picture"" mode once recording starts. This will allow your recording to continue while giving you access to the rest of your phone. This comes in handy since I'm using this + Blink, Echo, Arlo, Smart Home and Alexa to control everything on one device. My phone also went to sleep mode but the recording did not skip a beat! Lastly, the manually recorded clips are contained in your local file under the user tab on the bottom right. Sorry if some of this is super basic. This is just what I've learned in the past week of operating and staring at my security system making sure the unstable people are captured if they try anything less than smart. Stay safe everyone!","This is a great camera overall and a very good unit for home surveillance applications. The packaging is good an it comes with everything you need to get started. It is nice that a mount is included. I mounted the unit on rails on my second story balcony overlooking my front yard. The angle of view is very good - it is pretty wide angle so you can cover a good sized area. The image quality is great both during the day and at night. It is nice that at night when a street light is on the camera stays in color. When it flips to the IR black and white mode the image quality is still good. The amazing feature of this camera is the human detection and auto tracking. I get a push notification through the mobile app almost instantly when a person is seen by the camera. I haven’t really gotten any false alerts from it so far which is nice. The camera was a little bit tricky to get connected to my WiFi at first but it was because I was a little bit beyond the recommended 15 ft max distance from the WiFi router during initial installation. Once you bring the camera working the recommended 15 ft radius it was pretty easy to get it added to the mobile app. The app is pretty easy to use and has all the features you would want. Overall I think this camera is a great value for the price and would recommend it, especially for home surveillance because it had the built in WiFi and you only need to supply power to the camera.",I can’t say enough great things. Option of local storage so I wasn’t held hostage to paying cloud subscription… picture quality is amazing. I bought mine so I can “catch” the animals eating all my flowers. Since installing a few weeks ago- watching all the crazy wildlife has become an evening ritual. Can’t say enough great things about these camera,"This a must have product from Imou! I already have the Bullet 2MP and the Cue 1080p camera for a year already, but I needed one that includes Pan mode, and I like the easy Pan & Tilt feature on this one, beautiful night vision color mode and the smart tracking feature. Also for nightvision mode, you can choose wether on motion detection, turn spotlights on and get full color video or just IR recording. It has two spotlights which is very bright. I like how the camera goes in the moving object and record instantly. The Cruiser model is a must have into your shop or home outdoors.",So far so goodCamera was pretty easy to get connected to WiFiDoes a good job letting me know if there’s movementWould like motion tracking to be a little betterWould recommend this cameraHopefully I can say the same a year from nowI have went thru 3 other cameras so far.... they didn’t work well after some time,129,29,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Outdoor-Floodlight-Imou-Weatherproof/dp/B08SC42G8B/ref=sr_1_22_sspa?keywords=ring+security+camera&qid=1640229493&sr=8-22-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFNUDBYWVNKNUZBRzUmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAwNjU1NjMyMUNEVERNSTlVUFBOJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNDQxMTA4UTNCU1VSSllTUDEmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9idGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl

Night vision is good for about 60’ - 75’ outdoors. Not so great in windows because the ir light reflects off the window. Just put them under a carport, an eve, or even build u a little wood covered platform like I did for the wife’s deer cam, and you’re golden. U can do it, Sparky… just use your head. The “wireless” is connectivity, Not power! U still need a 110v outlet near by or run an extension cord. As long as your phone can pick up your wifi network where u want to install the cam, your camera can too. After u install the cam on ur home network, u can view it with your smart phone from anywhere u have cell service.",Happy with these but the app could be a little more new user guide friendly for sure. Also you have to get a service that’s $11.99 a month to even really use them.

I purchased this refurbished Ring battery cam, and am very very happy with it. It requires no wiring, the entire device is powered by an internal rechargeable battery.More on the battery: The Battery life is insane. it came with 47% battery life out of the box, and I've used it for 3 weeks, and it's at 36% battery life. I did buy another battery to swap it out when it gets low. There are also solar options, but I'm good with swapping it out, but it seems like it will last at least 2 months on a full charge.You can install it a few ways, I did a wall mount to watch my front door area. I attached an image of the image quality in the app at night (there is a small lamp on my door area, so night vision isn't needed for my setup)The Ring app is great, it connects you and your neighbors to share warnings and get notifications for things going around in the community. Your camera is 100% private unless you decide to share. You will get notifications when someone steps in front of the camera, you can talk to them, etc.Setup took a couple of tries to allow it to update, but once I connected it to my wifi It was working.Make sure your wifi reaches the device.As far as a review of the refurbished aspect, you could tell it had been repackaged, but it was professionally done. There were no marks or damage on the product, just a couple o fingerprints. Would gladly purchase another refurbished product from Ring or Amazon.","I decided to add a camera to my new out-building. I decided to give this battery powered unit a shot. I already have a Ring doorbell, and a larger wired system. This little camera has been great. Clear picture. Easy to add to my Ring App. Battery life seems perfectly manageable. It has been running for weeks now, on lower power consumption settings. Battery is down maybe 85%? Best part, if I want to take it and use it elsewhere, I could.","Purchased because I have a recessed porch which makes seeing someone at the front door difficult, also a large open backyard which is extremely dark at night. I now get visual alerts and can see who is at my front door or when packages arrive, and if something is in the backyard or on the deck. Night vision is clear, easy installation and activating them took 30 minutes. Feel much safer with these cameras up now. Mine are mounted so I can reach them with a step ladder if I need to charge the batteries.","Camera is on front of our house and front of our driveway. Works great. Sometimes a little TOO great. We have a shared driveway and our neighbors apparently use the driveway ALOT lol :-). The boundaries work perfectly. Picture is extremely clear. Was extremely easy to mount. Mounted, configured, and up and running in about half an hour. The only thing that is a pain (and it may just be a setting I haven’t found yet) is when we get a motion alert it takes a few seconds for camera to load the recording. I love the linking feature so I can trigger my side driveway camera at the same time so I can record both parts of my driveway.","I got a great deal on this on one of Amazon's lightning deals.

We had it for about a year and it worked well, but the quality was garbage. So I got this one (ring doorbell 3) and the quality is so much better. I would recommend not getting the original and buying this one.","Don’t listen to the negative reviews. It was easy to connect to my SmartThings and setting up wifi is similar to google. When you connect to the network you have to disconnect your existing network and connect to the device with your phone or tablet. I was able to connect it through my existing hardwire doorbell and my existing doorbell ring worked as well. You just have to go through the ring app and turn that feature on. The video is clean, vivid and not choppy. I connected to my 5ghz network and the signal works just fine. I tested it multiple times with no issues. When someone rings the device my doorbell rings and my Amazon Alexa announces someone is at the front door. A banner popups up and on it and live view activates. The ring service is $30 a year. I also tried it through my fire tv and when asked show me the front door my TV screen went straight to live view. No app needed. Just remember to add the ring skill on your Alexa software and do a search for the device to add it. Once that’s done your set. I barely looked at the directions to set all this up.","I moved my 1st generation Ring Doorbell to the back door and installed the Ring Doorbell 3 at the front door. The field of view, responsiveness, sound quality and quality of the picture are much, much better on the Ring Doorbell 3 than the first generation unit. It also limits the motion response to just the area I selected unlike the old unit that over responded and picked up the movement of cars and trucks more than 30 feet away even though I had adjusted it to be less responsive. I'm very satisfied with the new unit.",I installed the device yesterday. It works GREAT and it is simple to set up.Soon we'll look into getting more devices for better home security.,"Updated: Sept 11, 2020. Changing to 5-star rating for two reasons, the outstanding customer service, and receiving a replacement that is working 100% the way it should. There were many emails back and forth to try and get my ring 3 working. After trying all possible remedies customer service sent me a new ring 3. I installed it 2 days ago and it is up and running without any of the problems I had in the past. So if you do have a problem rest easy knowing the Ring backs up their product and will make it right.Here's the pros/cons for me. Great picture quality and night vision are the pros, motion detection is really the only con I have. Even though I have set up the detection for the 5-15 feet range and have blocked 3 of the 4 areas you are allowed to it is still picking up traffic going by on the street which is about 40 feet from the door. Short of putting up a wall on my sidewalk (which I am sure the neighbors would love) I do not see any way of fixing this. I notice that many other reviewers have the same problems with setting distance and motion detection. Not sure if Ring will/can do a software fix for this but they should. So I guess that annoying detection is better than none at all.",32151,895,https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-3/dp/B0849J7W5X/ref=sr_1_21_sspa?keywords=ring+security+camera&qid=1640229493&sr=8-21-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFNUDBYWVNKNUZBRzUmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAwNjU1NjMyMUNEVERNSTlVUFBOJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA5MjMxMzJKTjFYQVRQUUlVSUomd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9idGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl

Great camera.,Just in time!,I can't say enough good things about this camera and company,"I’m a very big tech junkie and am very intrigued by Ring. I first bought ring doorbell 2 and loved the product and app so I went and purchased the Ring Spot light cam wired. The reason I opted for the wired version was I don’t like messing with batteries, however if I were to buy the battery version I’d buy the second battery pack to eliminate down time. The wired version is nice as your getting constant power. Then camera also starts recording motion faster with the wired version versus the battery version.Setup: super simple follow Ring app instructions and you’ll be up in running in 10 mins or lessInstall: I live in Nevada land of stucco homes so it takes a little longer to drill holes and place anchors. The ring mounting bracket comes with a level built in to make install easy “Pro tip I learned from my door bell” once you have the mounting bracket level I used a thin nail to start and mark my pilot holes for when I had to drill, which made the install even easier. Once you have the holes drilled anchors in installing is a breeze. The most time consuming part well for me as I’m OCD is space the holes for the cable clips. Overall the physical installation took 20 mins do to me being OCC. the cable is paintable to match your house. My stucco is white so it was a non issue.Functionality: in order for Ring,Arlo,Nest ect to work properly will require good WiFi and a good router. All these web based on demand cams require good WiFi if your WiFi or router isn’t up to par you’ll have a bad experience. I run a NetGear Night Hawk Router that I can pick up WiFi halfway down my street so no range extender needed for me. If you have a big house and your router is on the opposite side of the house from your cameras either buy the chime pro extender or better yet by a mesh WiFi like EERO or Orbi or googles mesh routers “you’ll thank me” the better WiFi signal the better your devices will operate.The App: The Ring App is super easy and user friendly and about to get even better here with new updates and usability. The app allows you to manually turn the lights on and off sound the siren create customized motion areas “a feature the battery version doesn’t do” as well as set the motion distance for the lights to come on. While reviewing a motion activity or in live view you have the option to turn the lights on or off as well as sound the siren. The app also keeps you informed of any issues with Rings servers or any downtime or issues with devices. The Ring cloud service is outstanding and it’s very reasonably priced at $3 a month which is cheap. I don’t need 24/7 video I only need motion events so $3 a month is a great value. The motion or activity alerts are fast and show up on your phone quickly. The two way communication is nice and clear to tell would be questionable people to buzz off if not the alarm will scare them away and wake your neighbors.Overall I am very satisfied with my Spotlight cam wired and my ring doorbell and plan to add more ring devices very soon, with the upcoming software updates from ring the experience is going to get even better. Again I can’t reiterate enough you have to have good WiFi and router for this device or any of the competitors devices to work properly. I’m a very very picky person with electronics and can say Ring Spot light cam wired met and exceeded my expectations.The neighborhoods feature within the app is also a great tool to keep you informed of activity or events within your community. Again I highly recommend this product",,"I have 4 ring Floodlight cameras in use at another property. I really like them so I was excited to see the new Spotlight camera added to the ring lineup. I tried the ring Stick Up Cam Solar prior to ordering the Spotlight and I ultimately returned it due to being spoiled by the better build quality and overall camera quality of the Floodlight Cam. I included photos to show the field of view comparison between the two. While they aren’t installed in the exact same location, you can see just how much better the Spotlight Cam looks. As expected, the light output is greater on the Floodlight Cam but the Spotlight Cam does a good job of lighting up the immediate area around the unit. After installing and using my first Spotlight camera, I promptly ordered a second and installed it as soon as it came in. Both have been operating as expected. The camera video quality is great, the field of view is awesome. I have already influenced at least one friend to buy a wired Spotlight Cam and he is just as happy with it. I do wish that ring would add some more customization to their iOS app. It would be great to be able to reorder the cameras in any order you want vs left to right based on order of set up. It would also be nice to know if the motion detector triggered the lights or if the lights are on for extended periods without having to open the app. I found that after losing power at one property while not there that the lights stayed on after power was restored. I just happened to notice they were on when I was in the app and had to manually turn them off. HomeKit compatibility would rock too! Anyway, the Spotlight Cam is great! Way to go Ring!",,,9137,1,https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Spotlight-Cam-Wired-Plugged/dp/B0756P26HL/ref=sr_1_11?keywords=ring+security+camera&qid=1640229493&sr=8-11

But it works.,Fantastic PTZ Camera,Fantastic overall PTZ Camera,Amazingly Great Camera,Awesome zoom in quality!,"I like this camera, but setup was troublesome at first. I tried connecting P2P and it wouldn't work. I tried connecting directly on my network, using the included power adapter, and it wouldn't work. I tried connecting it through my Amcrest NVR on a PoE port, and still didn't work. The camera powered on and did its little spin start up move, and then it sat idle. The NVR gave it an IP address, but it was not able to actually connect or view the camera feed.Finally, after unplugging and replugging the camera back in, I was able to connect it, after manually adding it to the NVR and refreshing a few times. I have no idea why the camera was fighting during setup, but it's working great now.The image quality appears to be excellent. The camera adjusts quickly to changes in lighting, and it's responsive when using the PTZ functions. I'm also happy to see that it supports microSD cards up to 128GB, as that has been an issue for me with other security camera devices that wouldn't go above 32GB. One thing to be aware of when selecting a location to mount the camera is that the minimum focus distance is a little bit on the high side when zoomed in at all. This is somewhat to be expected, but you should keep it in mind if you plan on putting it over a door or something and want to be able to see faces.Another thing to consider is that the PTZ motor is not silent. If people are close enough, they will certainly hear it moving in a quiet area. Besides that, the camera itself is HUGE. I was not expecting it to be quite this big. It's at least twice the size of my other security cameras, and it's a bit heavy. Which is great if you need to throw it at an intruder.Overall, it's a great security camera and I'm happy with the purchase.","Needed a PTZ camera for my backyard and decided to splurge on this one thinking I'd just return it if it didn't justify its cost. This is an expensive camera for home use, and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a PTZ camera. The PTZ is fast and smooth with fine adjustments possible. This camera isn't plagued by the cheaper Amcrest indoor PTZ cameras that often overshoot their mark while trying to position them.The Zoom on this thing is incredible as well (the main reason I needed it). The 20x zoom is no joke and it auto-focuses precisely when zooming. You can control the iris, zoom, and focus all manually if needed as well. This become important if you have a part of the picture that it happens to focus on accidentally.You can do some really cool things with this like face detection, auto patrolling, etc (though I'm not using any of that since I use Blue Iris).All in all, I highly recommend this camera to those who must have zoom/PTZ and can afford the cost.","The camera itself is very well built. It's metal housing is thick and overall I am impressed with the build quality. Keep in mind this camera is quite heavy so plan ahead when finding a location to mount. You can power it by either POE+, direct DC or the included wall wart power plug. The setup of this camera is identical to the other Amcrest cameras. You simply power it on with network connectivity and scan the QR code using the Amcrest View Pro app. Once that is complete an IP is assigned and you can view the camera using a web browser.I run Blue Iris and this camera integrates with BI flawlessly. I can control all the PTZ functions from the BI interface. I very much appreciate how easy all of the Amcrest cameras work with Blue Iris. It makes my life SO much easier.The picture quality is exactly what you'd expect from a 4MP camera. The zoom on this camera is impressive, especially at night. For example,at night while zoomed out an object in the distance (~100ft) is almost not visible. I zoom into the object and suddenly it's lit up like the camera is right in front of it. The automatic light control is so nice.Overall this is an impressive camera with a ton of capability. If you don't run Blue Iris the camera has an SD card slot for local storage or it can save videos to NAS or FTP. The camera can work very well on it's own.","I wanted to update a PTZ camera for my driveway and decided to splurge on this one thinking I'd just return it if it didn't justify its cost. This is an expensive camera for home use, and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a PTZ camera. The PTZ is fast and smooth with fine adjustments possible. This camera isn't plagued by the cheaper other vendors PTZ cameras that often overshoot their mark while trying to position them.The Zoom on this thing is incredible as well (the main reason I needed it). The 20x zoom is no joke and it auto-focuses precisely when zooming. You can control the iris, zoom, and focus all manually if needed as well.You can do some really cool things with this like face detection, auto patrolling, etc. I have paired it with my Synology Security Center and it works great. It connects fast and integrated perfectly. I have full access of the camera from within Security Center.All in all, I highly recommend this camera to those who must have zoom/PTZ and can afford the cost.","First impression when I received the PTZ was great, looks solid, feels durable, and looks nice. Being a PTZ camera it will weigh more then your average camera, this PTZ comes in almost 7 lbs, so mounting them can be tricky if not thought out ahead of time. Installation wasn’t bad once I had the game plan. I had no issue powering the camera with POE over cat 6. When the camera powered up, got the ip changed, loaded into my NVR and away with testing. The camera quality is as expected, great clear 4mp image even at night! The PTZ functions work great, with minor delays controlling it through mobile, and again even at night the quality is very clear! I was most surprised with how good the zoom function worked at night while balancing the light and keeping a nice clear image. Even at maximum zoom night or daytime, you get a nice clear 4mp image of what ever you zoom into. Its as if you are right in front of what ever it is you zoomed in on. The other function that I find helpful is “tour”. You can set up multiple camera positions and set a time to stay on each position. When you hit play, the camera will automatically “tour” those preset camera positions while recording if you want. Overall, I have found the IP4M-1063EW-AI to be a very well-built camera, offer great quality footage, offer great features, and performs great! With that being said, I recommend this camera to anyone that may have a large area that needs camera coverage, or if you need a solid zoom in feature. This camera will get the job done!",40,16,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-Outdoor-Motorized-Security-IP4M-1063EW-AI/dp/B08TYGDH1Q/ref=sr_1_21?keywords=security+camera+without+wifi&qid=1640229611&sr=8-21

(Wiring available if needed too),"I am very impressed by this doorbell camera. The video quality is amazing and crystal clear. We have a long driveway but have two locked gates and a sign post. We installed in a few minutes (have a 5-acre span mesh network system) and it was super simple to connect.There are various ring tones to choose from. The door bell once pressed will start lighting up red and you'll hear a chime. On the receiving end you'll hear the chime you selected as your ringer. The volume from the unit is amazing and can be heard in our entire home.And speaking thru the camera app is an interesting option especially for our setup as we can advise the pin code to the key lock so that authorized visitors can come to our property even when we are not home. My wife also likes the fact that she can work in the garden and still be alerted when not in the house.Follow the simple install procedure like we did and you'll have yourself an awesome doorbell camera! It really shouldn't take the average person to setup and if you ever do run into a problem, the manufacturer has outstanding customer support!",This doorbell camera feels solid and durable. it can be installed in about 5-10 minutes. it includes a free door bell chime that it can be paired with and sends alerts when someone is at the door. it also creates a log so i can check to see who has been at my door. there are several chime options and it places a call to my phone when someone is at the door and i can talk to them even if i'm not home. The picture quality is pretty good and offers standard or high definition as well as night vision and motion detection with an adjustable sensitivity. the seller is very responsive and helpful as well.,"The camera looks amazing. High quality. Not cheap at all! It doesn't come with much instructions. Pretty basic. Charge, install it on the cloud app, hook it up to your doorbell system or just keep the box in the middle of your living room so it can be heard. With the app on your phone, any time someone rings, your phone rings. You can also share it with your family members as well so they can view and answer the door when you're away. Also, there are 2 types of quality you can view your camera footage in, SD or HD. HD is great but it would drain your battery faster. SD is basic and all you really need. So keep it on SD until you need HD.","Picture quality is amazing. Night vision is amazing, set up was easy. I mean I'm a woman so it took me some effort to screw the mount into the wall but other than that, super easy to work with. I set my motion detection on 5, that's the mist sensitive, because I live in Apts and ppl like stealing packages etc. .. plus I don't have a peep hole on my door, so I can just view them on the live cam. I love it so far. I hope it lasts and is actually weather proof, I live in Texas and we never know what the weather will be like here. It came with tools to set it up, and a user guide, it doesn't have much instructions but it's really straightforward and easy to set up anyway.","Currently using this wireless on my back door, but it does come with everything to hardwire it as well. The picture is great for a small wireless camera. The motion sensor alerts me when there's movement and you can set the sensitivity. The app allows continuous live viewing and if you have an SD card in or the cloud service than you can view a recorded history of events. The indoor chime has a few different rings and is also completely wireless. It said it has a battery life of about 5 months so I'll update that once I have a chance to run it that long. Overall it's a pretty simple yet effective product. I would recommend it if you're looking for a good deal on a doorbell camera.",99,64,https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Doorbell-COOAU-Multi-User-Detection/dp/B09B1HZQV2/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=security+camera+without+wifi&qid=1640229611&sr=8-19

Given the insufficient sunlight, my previous installed camera always run out of power. Thanks to the large solar battery panel, power outrage is no longer a problem, even when the camera was set on a high-power consumption mode. Furthermore, the camera comes with a long micro-USB cable, which makes it possible to connect the camera to an electrical and do 24h continuous recording mode.The installation is straightforward. One of the reasons is that unlike most cameras which only provide a fixed angle, this camera is more flexible to obtain a 360-degree view. So not too much adjustment is needed when installing.The app is easy to use. The camera provides a crispy view, even at night or in stormy weather. It is also possible to record colorful picture at night. The motion/humanoid detection is sensitive. The intercom works great, through which I can speak to the deliverers when I am at work.Cons: While the WiFi signaling could be a limitation, this product does work well with a WiFi extender. In contrast, my previous camera does not.","It helps a lot that it does not require wires. There is not much place for me to plug the camera in if it needs to be plugged in. So the being wireless and solar powered saved me from having to find a place to plug in, from constantly having to buy batteries and, from the hassle from dealing with the wires. Not only that, the recording shows up very clearly on my phone and it is very sensitive to human motion. So I know when someone comes close to my door and i can clearly see who it is. I am also able to speak to the person through the camera. It is very convenient if I am on vacation or at work.","I purchased one of these cameras to keep an eye on my off the grid cabin. I was pleasantly surprised with it. The unit was very easy to install. The picture quality is excellent and the app is easy to use. . The night vison is very strong and clear. I have been impressed with the battery life and have yet to run it down. I like the camera so much I purchased two more for my property. I have them set up outside approximately 200' from the cabin and they work great.The best part about these cameras is their customer service. I had a question about a feature on the app. I received a quick response from their rep and a solution to follow.If you are looking for an affordable, easy to use, wireless CCTV solution these cameras are for you.","You'll want a drill for the holes. I started mine with hammer and nail, then drilled. They provide a paper for drilling the holes, which made it easy. You'll need to charge the solar plate for 3 to 5 hours inside, before installing. Also, important, if you use the micro SD card, insert it first. When pairing the camera to your internet, be about 1 1/2 feet from router. The camera ""speaks,"" and is kind of loud. The trickiest part of installing were the bottom holes. I found that doing the right side first, then let camera rotate and hang down for the 2nd bottom screw made it easier, then do top screws. *** The picture quality is very good, day or night. (I can see the bugs flying at night!) Initially, it took several minutes to get it to connect, but once it connects a few times, it goes quite quickly. Camera rotation works great. Whether at home or away, it works great.","I installed this solar camera in front of the garage door. It can monitor the front of my garage door, the front door, and the grass without blind spots. When someone approaches my door. It will also sound an alarm. Makes me feel a lot safer. It is a colorful picture during the day. At night it is a black and white picture. And this solar energy does not need to install wires. Just install it in a sunny place. Don't worry about installation. Will also buy one to install on my back door.",38,22,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Wireless-Tracking-Surveillance-Detection/dp/B097T1QVF3/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=security+camera+without+wifi&qid=1640229611&sr=8-16

I found these and thought they would be a quick and easy answer to my problem.Shipping was quick and easy and everything showed up in great shape.Out of the box, everything looked great. The installation is fairly simple, and it comes with all the required hardware. The batteries will need to be charged a while in order to ensure the battery life is optimal. After charging them overnight, I installed the mounts, slid the battery into place, and followed the instructions on the app. After a short wait everything was set up and ready to go.These have been up for a while now and I have absolutely nothing bag to say. As long as you have wifi boosters around the house, you should not run into any issues with connectivity or lag. The notifications are great, and the video clarity is exactly what I was looking for. Additionally, this system allows you to post possible issues to the neighborhood so your neighbors can be made aware of issues. For example, I recently saw a lady had her package stolen off her front porch and they managed to get the whole thing on video.Overall, I would absolutely recommend these for someone that is looking for a simple solution to a home security video system. This allows you to be literally anywhere and still check on things around the property. I would am extremely happy with this product and will continue to do business with them in the future.","Love these cameras. I bought the 2 pack 7 weeks and 1 day ago when I discovered someone was peeking in our windows and testing our locks, and just had to change the battery today. The front camera goes off 4ish times per day (when we go to and get home from work), and the battery was at 5% this morning. Our back porch camera goes off about 1-2 times per week and was at 37% this morning. I live in upstate NY so these cameras were installed in single-digit weather, and the batteries have now lasted through into the warmer 50-60 degree days. I'm amazed at how long the battery life has lasted and the quality of the video. I love that I can see my packages get delivered (the delivery man even waves at the camera), the quality of the video is amazing, and I can go back and watch old footage as well as go to a live view whenever want. The spotlight is great for helping with night vision and I love that I can talk to whoever is in front of the camera. Definitely recommend. Purchased a second battery for each camera to extend the battery life (have not put them in yet; this review is on a single battery in each camera) and look forward to getting 3+ months of battery life out of each camera.","I was reluctant to have to spend any money on outside cameras but all my research pointed me to Ring products. Price point on the wireless spotlight cameras is excellent and once I got the cameras, installation was so easy. I have had them about a week and everything works well. Only major complaint that needs to be addressed asap by the company is recording time. We need full event recording rather than short clips. Only recording the first 30 seconds does nothing if a burglar or nefarious person waits 30 seconds to rob you. It should at least start re-recording after the 30 sec period if motion is still detected. This can mean the difference between catching a thief or not. It must be addressed immediately! If they fix that then they will have a much better rating!","FOLLOW-UPJust when I thought I was Ringless, I finally spoke to a Ring rep over the phone and was very pleased with the next step. Not only did Ring understand my frustration, they were aware that my camera was not displaying. Ring sent me a replacement camera and emails wanting to know more. A review of a company should note the wrong and a follow up when they make it right. I recommended Ring to my friends and family when I bought it in 2019, I standby their product therefore ""I"" standby my Endorsement. Thanks RING!","I love these, and how easy they integrated with the ring door bell we already had, After they arrived, I realized based on placement, they option of 2 batteries versus one was the way to go, so I didn't have to keep on getting up on the ladder and charging, (which takes several hours) and be without coverage.The wifi even when it was 7 feet away with a window between, we had problems connecting, I would get a notification, and moments later it might pull up. That too is random when it does that.The motion is fabulous, I had to place one really high to capture the back yard 2 stories up, and it catches everything, to the point I had to scale back sensitivity, and shut off one side of it, as my tree would move. One thing I would love to see Ring do with these, is allow you to draw out the objects triggering the motion sensor like on the door bell. This one, you just turn of sections.Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to consider these, just know going in the things that are small hiccups.",2750,119,https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Spotlight-Cam-Battery-Security/dp/B07K7CSVJ8/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=security+camera+without+wifi&qid=1640229611&sr=8-15

Had to reboot the cam twice to get the SIM to activate (not a big deal). Battery is 75%+ every morning and is fully charged on solar every evening. Image quality is great. Android & iPad apps are excellent and easy to use. Motion sensing is slightly lacking as it is a PIR sensor and not image motion recognition. Camera only records motion events triggered by the PIR sensor so if you need constant recording you will need wired cameras and an NVR. Overall I'm very satisfied!,"I bought this camera to monitor a remote renovation project and it works great. No power needed, no wifi required. It works on the rechargable battery & solar panel. At first I bought two tmobile sim cards from a seller on Amazon, but the sim cards would not work and the camera kept saying Sim card Not Recognized. I went to two different Tmobile stores and called customer service (45-minute call) and no one was able to help. I did not want to give up on the camera and I instead decided Tmobile was not the right route for me. I went to Target and picked up a FreedomPop Sim Card $9.99 - Free Basic Plan & GSM SIM Kit and it works great! The set up, from the time of using the FreedomPop was very fast, simple and easy and I am grateful at the quality and ease of the camera. I purchased two of them and would definitely recommend.","Update:changed my rating to 5 stars. The limited sim card options and reception problems are the cell companies issues not the camera manufacturer. The camera works reliably. Just took two days to set it up finding a pre-paid data provider.Also you are able to use an external battery pack to charge your camera.Nick of time! Most importantly be patient, the setup of the sim card is not a breeze it will take time and try your patience. T-mobile prepaid data sim cards are nearly non-existent as they are moving to a different platform. AT&T pre-paid works. What I recommend as steps to follow for setup. 1. Receive your camera/charge the battery right away. 2. Take your camera to the cellular store you plan on using for data. Set it up with the clerk and test it right there before you leave. Now the hard part is done, be sure your carrier is a GSM and supports WCDMA and FDD LTE. DO NOT EXPECT to receive your Amazon box and use the camera right away. I came to use this camera because I was looking for something multifunctional and reliable and I got that. Our old wifi camera died and cellular gives you a lot more flexibility. I was impressed with the solar panel and construction of the camera. I received the camera Tuesday night, set it up Wednesday night, caught the foal being born Thursday morning. Also audio is good and decent battery length. You should have a micro SD card to install right away.

In general, I've always liked the simplicity of the setup and the ease with which different settings can be customized in the app. I bought my first camera in 2019, second one in 2020 and the third one now. The wire-free advantage is totally worth it, if you disregard the minor inconvenience of having to take it down charge it every few months. This solar-powered camera provides a perfect solution to that, especially if you have to mount it in a place which requires some effort to remove and put up again. The product is not TOTALLY wire-free now since you have a small cable running from the solar panel to the camera, but this in my opinion is a perfectly acceptable compromise. They also have a rubber seal where the USB cable plugs into the camera body, so it is indeed waterproof.Since they moved to the Zumimall app from the previous Cloudedge, I've found the alarms and the settings are relatively more stable. I'm able to see all my cameras on one screen and each of them can be configured with my preferred alarm interval and motion detection sensitivity. These work really well, I've found a ""medium"" motion detection sensitivity and 2 minute alarm interval works best for me.Make sure you get a Micro SD card (a small capacity one will do) so it can record videos once the alarm is triggered. You either need a micro SD card or a subscription to their cloud service to record videos. I don't use their two way communication feature much but have tested it and can confirm it works well.In short, totally worth the price compared to some other cameras on the market. I'd recommend without hesitation.",This camera has been great. The image quality is very clear. I love the solar panel attachment to keep it charged at all times. The two way talk is an excellent feature to be able to talk to someone outside of your house. I also like the motion detection to alert me if something or someone is in my driveway. This works great when waiting on food delivery or company. This camera also has night vision that is very easy to see out of. The app is easy to use and the camera was very easy to connect.,"I bought this camera to cover the other entrance to the house after having already purchased another model from Zumimall for the main entrance.I was intending to just grab the exact same model as the other camera until I noticed that this new model comes with a solar charger, which will allow me to not have to manually charge this camera. I was even able to save a little money by having the solar charger included, instead of having to order one later.So is this camera as good or better than their previous model? Yes! This camera is amazing. The setup is super simply. You literally just download the Zumimall app, turn on the camera, and follow the step by step instructions in the app. The instructions are well written in English (not looking like someone used google translator) and even include troubleshooting for each selection.From the beginning of downloading the app, turning on the camera, entering a email address & password for your account, and the couple of steps to connect to the camera, you will not spend over 2 minutes in the entire process. They really made the setup fast and foolproof.The mounting of both camera and solar panel is very simply and sturdy. You wont ever wonder if high winds are going to rip them away.The picture and audio quality of the camera is excellent. The app will even allow you to change to a full screen view if you want a larger view. The night vision is perfect as well and you really get amazing detail in both day and night time. I like that you can zoom in on live views if you see something far off. The mic system is very good and clear.One thing that was improved in the app was the ability to ''select all'' recordings to delete, instead of individually selecting each one. I also like the ability to use the alarm feature if you want to.Overall the camera is a great buy, and so far does everything I was wanting it to. If I have any issues, I will update this review.","This is my THIRD ZUMMIMALL camera and I absolutely love it! They are super easy to operate with simple controls. Tons of features and yet easy to navigate. Everything has been thought of with the camera and in the app. The range to catch the WiFi signal is EXCEPTIONAL. The camera is mounted on my shop and the router is in my house (you can see the long distance from the pics). With it being solar-powered, you can set it and forget it. Every time I get into my Jeep it alerts me, which is the whole point of having it. I have another brand camera that doesn't have nearly the amount of features, the app is confusing, and its battery drains after about a month (supposed to last around three months). I definitely recommend this camera and hands down recommend this manufacturer, ZUMMIMALL!!","For its price, this is a robust security camera that works as advertised, with only a few minor quirks.The setup is very easy and only took a couple of minutes to pair the camera with the Zumimall app on my iPhone. The camera connects to whatever wi-fi signal your phone is using at the time of setup, as long as its a 2.4GHz signal—it is not compatible with 5GHz wi-fi.Once the camera is linked to the app, it shows up as a device that you can select. Once selected it typically takes a few seconds to load the stream. Occasionally it takes a little longer or fails to connect and I have to retry, but this could easily be an issue with my Asus wifi mesh system—its difficult to say just yet.The stream is HD and looks good with nice colors during the day. When you turn your phone to landscape, the stream goes full screen. I’d say it looks like a solid 1280x720 image, but not sharp enough to look like 1920x1080, probably do to optics limitations or compression. You can also switch to SD, presumably to use less bandwidth if desired.Once the camera is streaming to the app, you can choose between a “Live” tab or a “History” tab which will show a list of any recordings the camera has made to the micro SD card (sold separately). The micro SD card is a little tricky to put in or take out because the slot is slightly inset on the back of the camera. I end up using tweezers to insert or remove it.There is also a “Cloud” tab to review cloud recordings if you are paying for the close service, which is $4.99 per month per camera. There is no way to manage your cloud recordings though. It would be nice if there was a way to delete certain recordings if you so desired, but there does not seem to be an interface for that. It would also be nice if you could review and manage recordings through a web browser login. Bottom line is I would like to feel more in control of my recordings.The recordings are triggered by motion detection, which has a sensitivity setting from 1 to 10. When set to 9, I was getting a good deal of recordings triggered by minor events, or perhaps rustling tree leaves. You can also specify how long each motion detection event is recorded—10seconds, 20seconds, or 30seconds—and wether or not you want an interval between alarm events (none, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, or 10 minutes). I keep the interval turned off so that a new recording can begin just a second or 2 after the last recording ends, if motion is still being detected. On the downside, I’ve found that the first 2 or 3 seconds of motion are not recorded, presumably while the camera activates its record function, which means the camera is not continuously buffering video.The recordings on the SD card can be viewed in the app wether or not you are at home or somewhere out in the world and wether using wi-fi or on cellular data. There is no additional setup for this, it just works.Event recordings can be saved to your phone’s album by playing back a video and pressing a record button in the app. This saves the video to an album within the app, and from there the video can be exported to your phone’s album. Its a bit cumbersome, but it does allow you to record just the bits you want.The app will send you notifications every time a motion detection event occurs, or you can turn that off in the camera settings. You can also turn it off in your phone’s notification settings. If you do that, but keep the notifications turned on in the camera settings, you will get audible motion alerts if the app is opened.One big checkmark in the plus category is the company’s responsiveness. They have been answering my email questions within a day or 2.As for the solar panel, it works. I installed the camera 3 weeks ago, and as of yesterday evening, the battery shows 5 out of 5 bars. It was 4 out 5 bars a few days ago, but then I realized that as we are moving closer to winter, the solar panel was becoming shaded by a neighbor’s tree earlier and earlier in the afternoon. So I moved the panel a few few to compensate. The camera comes with about 7 (estimated) feet of wire to allow the solar panel to be moved away from the camera to a more optimum location.The two-way audio works, but it is subject to network lag, plus the volume is not all that loud if the camera is outdoors, which is not surprising for a speaker inside a small camera.Night vision also works well and looks good, and the camera can be set to automatically switch to night vision when the ambient light levels have dropped.You can link multiple cameras to the app and monitor multiple cameras on screen at the same time.",100,67,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Wireless-ZUMIMALL-Detection-Waterproof/dp/B09836Q17M/ref=sr_1_14_mod_primary_new?keywords=security+camera+without+wifi&qid=1640229611&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sr=8-14

It's getting pretty ridiculous since the cops couldn't do anything. My front door and front yard camera caught them in the act, but it was way too far to see anything clearly or get a good read of the thieves' license plate... Thus, the reason I got this camera set. Both cameras have built-in battery and it last pretty long on a full charge. I have them up for almost a month, and battery is at around 85% right now. It's very small, very compact and white so they blend in well in my tree (where I attached these cameras on the tree trunk near my front gate, so I can have better video footage of the street and side walk in front of my house). I also like this setup with a central hub, because the captured videos and photos are stored on the micro SD card on the hub (which is sitting inside my house), in case thieves spot the cameras and trying to steal the camera, I can still have the footage to give to authority or insurance claims. I have the central hub sitting inside my house, which is about 100 feet away from the cameras, and the signal quality is at around 60%, which is pretty stable to ensure no losses in captured video/photo transferring. The phone app also notifies me anytime it detects a motion and send me a snapshot when motion was detected. It works very well so far. Hopefully, next time something happens in front of my house, I can get a clearer footage to provide to authority.","This is a great security camera option for those who doesn't want to drill holes in the walls for wires.It comes with 2 cameras that has rechargeable batteries, which can be charged using USB-C cable.The battery supposed to last up to 270 days, which is pretty impressive but I'm sure it will be shorter if it constantly detects motions all day long. Ideally this type of camera is good for places where there should not be any motion other than potential intruders.The setting up the camera with the free app for my iPhone was pretty straight forward. You do have to sign up and create a free account in order to use the app and camera.By default, it asks you to connect to your router using ethernet cable but there's also an option to connect via wireless, which is what I did. I always use GUEST wireless SSID access point for anything that needs my home wireless access.After I successfully setup the app, I was playing around with the camera in my hand and immediately received few notifications about motion and human detection then a loud alarm went off few times. It turns out that it has a Tamper Alarm, which is great since alarm will go off if intruder tries to turn off or turn the camera around. The Tamper Alarm can be disabled from the setting in the app.The video quality was impressive and the app is very intuitive. It shows the battery level as well as wireless signal strength. The base station is what connects to your wireless and has the microSD card for video recording. The 2 cordless cameras communicate with the base station so they will work fine as long as they are close to the base station.You have the option to purchase the subscription to store the video recordings in the cloud but I don't think this is needed since all recordings will be in the base station, which is inside your house so even if the camera is tampered, they can't get to the recorded video files unless they break into the house. Hopefully, you will get the notification when it detects the intruders and take action to scare them off.The cordless feature of this security camera is the main attraction for me. I can place this cameras in different places and move them around as needed. I don't like to have security camera permanently mounted since it makes it appear like I have a reason to keep intruders out but I do want to set up it up when I'm going out of town or vacation since that's when I need it the most.Overall, I'm very happy with it and it's well designed in both hardware and software app. 5 out of 5 stars!","This camera was purchased for usage in my front door. I work the night shift and needed a camera to keep a watch on the door and garage while I was gone. I needed a camera that runs on batteries and connects to WiFi so that I wouldn't have to make holes in the walls for electricity and Internet. I ordered this camera since it met all of my needs. Before using it for the first time, I fully charged it for a few hours. I started setting up after I was sure it was completely charged. To begin, you must first download the app and register, which takes only a few minutes. Then, once the app is ready, switch on the camera and show the QR code from your phone screen to the camera, which will immediately connect.The app itself is excellent; you can choose between HD and SD photos, as well as capture screen shots and video to save to your phone. You can enable motion detection and receive notifications when your phone detects movement. I've only had it for a few days and the battery is still charged, so I can't comment on battery life, but I'll update my review to let everyone know how long it lasts before I have to charge it again. I am extremely pleased with this small camera, and it has behaved as predicted thus far, so I give it 5 stars!",I've had these LaView security cameras for over a week now and am very impressed. The setup instructions were clear and easy to follow. I already had the LaView app on my phone so it took only a few minutes to plug in the base station and pair the cameras. The cameras came fully charged so that was a bonus. The cameras have some weight to them an feel well made. One thing to note: they come with the tamper alarm set on so it goes off while setting them up. Need to turn that off while placing them. It's great that they are wireless and I don't have to run wires to them or plug them in. I placed one on a tree overlooking my garage and front entryway to alert me when packages or guests arrive as we live in the country at the end of a long driveway. Works great so far and the picture quality is fantastic despite the fact that the camera is quite a ways from the base station. Even the night vision shots are clear. I use my cell phone to do live checks of the house when I'm away and the alert notifications work well.I like that they use a base station to link multiple cameras rather than each one operating independently.The app on my phone works well and is easy to navigate but the functions are not fully explained in the supplied instructions. There is a good YouTube video that explains all their functions though. I like that the app displays signal strength and battery level as well as having a human detection feature to minimize false alarms.I had a question on using the MicroSD card and emailed LaView support. The response was quick and Professional.All in all - a great product and excellent support.,"I'm reviewing the dual camera system with the base station. There was no memory card that was included with the system but I was able to successfully use a 128GB Samsung micro sd card in the base station. The system is capable of handling up to 4 cameras but for the time being, I'm just using the two that were supplied with the system.The template that is included in the box was easy to use and I was able to drill into the side of the house for one of the cameras and another into a tree without any difficulties. The cameras are about 30 feet away from the base station and I have not had any connectivity issues with them.Charging the cameras was painless and easy. So far it seems that the battery has only gone down slightly over the past 5 days with roughly 25 detections per camera per day. The ability to use the app on my iPhone to view these cameras is nice! Previous to this I have also bought the two package of the moving indoor camera which had the 32GB cards included inside them. Those do not require this basestation.Overall, I feel that this is a good system and the alerting has been manageable and not obtrusive where the cameras are positioned. I will be attempting to change where they are pointed to reduce the amount of alerts. Quite a feature rich device and had all of the features that I was looking for.",26,12,https://www.amazon.com/Security-LaView-Detection-Weatherproof-Assistant/dp/B095BFW7C4/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=security+camera+without+wifi&qid=1640229611&sr=8-13

I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't. None. Not a single thing.It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways. I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed. Nope.I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house. Nope. There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not. They are not location aware in any way. The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording. Nope!The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours. Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room. I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on. This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%. This is with all the 'battery saving options' on. This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording. So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing. I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality. The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.***UPDATE***Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera. You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then. Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't. Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera. The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support. Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.***ANOTHER UPDATE***From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"". This will be a great update and should have been available on launch. I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.***ONE MORE UPDATE***Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days. It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration. With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set. They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away. For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off. You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc. Or any combination. The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can. This is a great improvement. They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5. This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras. I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.***LAST UPDATE***Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I've had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now. All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night. Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn't bad. I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it's pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation. They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you're thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them.","Before I start my revised review, let me state that there's been a lot of news lately about people hacking into Ring cameras, but this only happens when someone installs a new camera and doesn't update the default username and password (or has an extremely weak password which is easy for a hacker to guess). This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions.Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product.Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all.Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement.A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring.Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised.***UPDATE***Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices.Ring has now updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new wireless battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well.Observations.Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool.I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a few months before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent.I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once.Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete.I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic.Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.","Had the camera up and running in less than ten minutes. Excellent quality picture. Hooking up to the solar panel when installing, this way battery is always charged. Received mounting hardware, camera has been installed.",Installed 2 of these outside my house in about 20 minutes. Mounted one above my garage and the other near my front door. The video quality is pretty good. Not facial recognition software good but good enough for a good description of people if needed. I used the mounts that came will the camera and scanned the QR code for setup. Not sure why people couldn't set up zones. It is part of the setup unless you skip over the steps. I do agree with most reviews that the notifications are spotty. Took my trash out and the one by the garage only recorded me going to the side of the house and the one by the front door only recorded me coming back. A neighbor walked by this morning and it started recording after they walked by and were down the street. Pic attached. Went outside again and the both cameras picked me up as I would have expected. I will adjust the camera and reset the zones to see if that helps. They are my first Ring cameras so there may be fine tuning on my part that is needed. Will update this as the days go by.Windows 10 app logs me in but says I don't have any cameras set up. Tried on a PC and 2 laptops. Please fix!!Phone apps are pretty good so far. (Samsung note 9)Updating to 5 Stars.....After adjusting my zones and motion settings I was able to get the results I needed. At one point the wind blew leaves across my driveway and my sensor went off. After fine tuning I see no issues with the camera and its performance. It is by far better than other cameras I have purchase over the years and after comparing subscriptions from other companies $10 a month or $100 is a deal.,Don’t let any negative reviews influence your decision to buy these cameras. The negative reviews are from people who have not read the instructions or just have no idea how a security camera works. I monitor 16 security cameras where I work so I have a lot of experience with them. I bought the Ring Stick up camera and the solar charger for it as well. They both work great. I bought two more a week later. Now a month later I have no issues with battery power loss of any kind. Just set your zones to cover what you want. Don’t put motion sensor on full or you will catch bugs and falling leaves. I set my sensitivity in the middle. The image quality day and night is pretty good.

I have had CCTV cameras in my house for years. I've been using Swann wired cameras for the most part with mixed emotions. But running new wires to upgrade the system just didn't excite me.I had been looking at NEST cams since I have the smart Thermostats and Smoke/Carbon-monoxide detectors for a while, but the price is ridiculous! Plus your only option with them is cloud service (an additional cost). Then I spoke with a neighbor who sent me a screen shot from his YI camera. I must say, the quality was pretty impressive.So I bought a four pack for $119.00 with moderate expectations. Let me tell you I'm super impressed with the picture quality of these cameras. Set up is quick and easy. When I purchased them I had no idea they had audio as well. The audio quality is incredible, plus it's a two way speaker. Purchased 32 GB SD cards for all of them so I didn't need to use cloud storage and it's been working great! I have them set to record all motion and I usually have about 7 days of history on each camera.Day and night vision are both spectacular IMO. I have attached several photos so you can see the quality both day and night. Side note, I have a couple ""indoor cams"" mounted outside. To do this I purchased a rubber sleeve/cover from Amazon to make the drop cam weather resistant for outdoor application. It's been through rain, sleet and snow with out issue so far. Link to cover: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FD5XHMP/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1A couple cons, the power cable is sooooooo short. I had to purchased longer cables for a couple of my installs. No biggie, they are only a few dollars here on Amazon. The app for iOS is very functional, but it has no multi camera view which would be a nice option.","So I have been using the Yi 1080p indoor camera system for 2 weeks now and I LOVE IT! The camera's are crystal clear during the day and are just as sharp in night mode. The added features of being able to hide any ""lights"" such as the blue power light and the typical red IR lights for night vision makes ""hiding"" these cameras a breeze. The playback function works great and give you the time in hours, minutes & seconds. The 2 way talk feature works great and has 2 modes, 1 is a push to talk feature where when you press the button you cannot hear what the person on the camera is saying and the 2nd is a continuous talk where you and the person on the camera can talk back and forth without pressing any buttons (love this feature) the 32gig on board storage is also a great bonus. Like I said I have been using the cameras for about 2 weeks and have barely used 3 gigs of space. (for an idea of the amount of traffic, it's just me, my wife and our 2 pets) so the cameras don't get a ton of action during the week. But are always recording on any motion. (I do not subscribe to the cloud storage as for I haven't seen a need) Anytime you get an alert it will store it on the app and you can upload it to your mobile device and share it with others. The initial motion detection clip is only 6 seconds, but if you wait till the end of the 6 seconds you will get an option to ""view entire motion"" which will bring up that camera, rewind to when it first detected the motion and play it back until there is no longer any motion, GREAT feature. All of the features seem to work as expected, you can set times for your camera to alert you when it detects motion and zones so that your dog walking around doesn't keep triggering the alerts. I can say the motion detection is VERY sensitive. You can set the setting to low, medium or high but really I can't tell a difference low to high. I have one camera facing out of my front window and it picks up shadows, car lights, leaves blowing, etc. Not a big deal, but on a windy day I can get a ton of alerts. The app works great, you can set a PIN or use your fingerprint to log into the cameras so in the event your phone is stolen, unless they have your PIN or fingerprint they will not be able to pull up your cameras. Connecting them was very simple and took less than 5 minutes per camera. Plug them in, scan the UR code and they will automatically connect to the network your phone is connected to. The packaging was very nice, didn't feel cheap. All cameras were individually wrapped along with all of the accessories. Comes with instruction booklet for assistance with installing/setup. The camera (black part) can be removed from the white base and mounted in different areas. They also sell (separately) wall mounts for the cameras. (cheap, like $10-$15 for a 4 pack) or you can stand them up anywhere you like (they have a round rubber grip on the bottom to help keep them from sliding around. All 4 cameras come with a USB cord and power brick. The USB cord is about 10-12 feet long so you should be able to place these cameras wherever you'd like. OK so I hope this rant...I mean review was helpful. If you're anything like me, I read all the reviews on a product before I make a purchase. Thanks for reading!***(I am not affiliated with Yi or any of there products, this was simple a consumer review, please purchase these at your own risk)***","I purchased the Yi 4 pk. 1080 Indoor security cameras. I was skeptical but am so glad I took the chance. I placed them in various windows facing outside as it’s outside I want to observe. They work perfectly during the day and, where the outside area is lit, at night. If the area is not lit, there is a reflection on the glass from the IR light, but they ARE designed to be indoor cameras. They work very well indoors, day and night, as intended. I have observed some sketchy people that have rung my doorbell when I’m not home (I have a camera in the window next to door), along with the neighbor’s cat, a family of raccoons, an opossum and numerous squirrels. I had an issue where they stopped alerting me of activity (which I see some others have had, also) and contacted Yi customer service. They promptly replied to my request and worked with me to make sure all my phone settings were correct. Turned out, the problem was with my phone settings, battery saver shutting down the app, NOT with the cameras or their app. I especially love that I can insert my own sd cards to save & view past events and not have to pay for ‘cloud’ subscription. I don’t know of another security camera that offers this. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase! In fact, I ordered another set of 4. If you are still in doubt, look up some reviews and comparisons of the Yi cameras on youtube.",,"Best Security Option for a home because:1. Its a one time charge- no monthly subscription- and all of the features of the camera work with the SD card2. The camera video is excellent especially the Night vision- it can see in almost complete darkness- wow3. The detection system is superb- I especially like that you can select an area within the total viewing area for detection. I use this feature so the cars that pass outside of my house do not trigger the alert only the area literally right in front of my door.4. The intercom is clear and at the appropriate volume5. Install and app use is seriously easy whether your a ""techy"" or not6. Small form and can be hidden without drawing attention7. Excellent price - for what you get its so worth it!8. Retrieve data on multiple device- My wife and I can both check our home and get the alerts simultaneously.9. Still records video on SD card even when wifi is out10. The option to make the camera stealth (no sound or constant blue light)As long as the camera and app lasts then I would definitely tell you do hesitate, buy it- its worth it and more.",25027,2,https://www.amazon.com/YI-Wireless-Security-Surveillance-Monitor/dp/B01CW4CEMS/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=security+cameras+without+subscription&qid=1640229824&sr=8-18

Great video quality. Easy to setup.,"I bought this system a couple months ago. I originally bought two other systems that arrived with problems, and I had to send them back for a refund. After doing a little more research, I bought this system for my small business. I unpacked the unit and tested it out at home before taking it to the business for installation. Before installation, I chose to purchase a new wifi router, which was quite an upgrade from what was already there, installed wifi extenders where the wifi signals were weak and tested the system and all cameras to be sure everything was working properly and recording. Once I was comfortable with the system, setting it up and installing it in the business was easy. The unit is installed on the second floor, and the cameras on the first floor, all the way to the back of the building, still work with no issues. I did not have to use the extended antennas that came in the box. I did have some questions for the company. The phone number and email are posted here at the bottom of the product description on Amazon, so finding contact information is easy. I chose to email the company, and within 24 hours or less I received a response. I needed assistance getting the system to display on a computer screen. Tech support sent a link to download the software along with instructions on how to set it up. I clicked on the link, downloaded the software, followed the install instructions, and all cameras popped up on our computer screen. The 3TB hard drive gives my business 30 days of recording, which is better than we expected. We have all 8 cameras set to record continuously 24/7. This is a great buy for the money.",I have been in the alarm industry for over 40 years but getting your company to install cameras (even at cost) is ridiculously expensive. I purchased these cameras just prior to our completing a remodel on our home and just started the installation. It was incredibly easy with essentially just plug and play set up. The pictures during the day (and night) are crystal clear and playback is extremely simple. The best issue is that I had some issues with the distance for the wireless reaching and have had incredibly quick response to each and every request for assistance. The system is simple but when there is an issue is is nice to have instant responses to your inquires for help. 5 star customer service and five star system. Really user friendly at all levels and I would recommend to anyone!,"I ordered the security system February 1, 2019 but just installed in on April 13th. The system is a Hiseeu with 8 1080P cameras and a 3TB hard drive. The system worked flawlessly right of the box.

That is quick.Second quick thing was the setup. Had hard time with some previous cameras where you need to switch off your 5G Wifi but thought to give a try and guess what it literally took less than 1 minute to setup.All you need is to Install the APP, turn on the camera, Add the camera and scan the QR code in front of the camera and its up and running. Quickest setup ever for any wifi camera. Installing the camera only took 4-5 mins.Result of the camera is also great for both day and night. I can easily read the license plates. (Street name is omitted in one of the photo).Battery is also very powerful. After all the testing for motion detection it remains the same even on third day.Motion detection is very efficient, It saves the footage on cloud right after it detects any movement. You can adjust the motion detection to high or low.Audio is also crisp and one can easily communicate both ways.","Now I have a total of 6 ZUMIMALL cameras. Since May 2019, I started collecting them. I got hooked on the first camera and I kept finding other places that I wanted to monitor for the occassional human visitor (driving up our long driveway) but mostly for the wildlife, since we live in the country.This latest edition to my collection (received 1 week ago) seems more clearer, the angle wider, the picture clearer and the signal stronger (67% - located over 100 feet from my router extender) . I like how the case extends over the front of the camera and keeps drops of rain off of the lens versus the others I have. I strongly recommend the ZUMIMALL brand and their products. Their customer service is great also. They are quick to respond and very helpful. I misplaced the tiny mounting screw to my ZUMIMALL Doorbell camera and asked how to go about getting a replacement. Soon after I sent the email, I got a positive response that indicated that they would send me a replacement screw (no cost to me). I'm looking forward to see what ZUMIMALL comes out with next. Thank you ZUMIMALL!!!","I bought this after my neighbor had a car window smashed in during the night. I needed to make sure if it happened to me, I was protected. I already had a zumimall camera, so it was a no brainier to buy this one. I've been using the other one for quite a while now - only difference is this one came with a solar charger. Huge benefit. I was able to mount it in an area that is impossible to reach without a ladder. I use an SD card to backup the alarm video that it records. It does not sound the alarm over a passing animal, only vehicles and people. The night vision is awesome. I'll include a daylight screenshot and a nighttime screen shot for reference. I'm very happy with this camera, and excited that I don't even have to pull it off the wall to charge anymore.","This review is for the Zumimall ZS-GX1SI was in the market for a wireless camera to use to investigate employee theft. I needed something that was motion activated and would be able to be hidden in a stockroom and record wrong doings. I came across this item because it seemed like it would do the trick and then I could repurpose it to record vehicles since it was fully wireless I would not need to install a power line to it.Reviewing the owners manual they offer a free 3 year warranty extension if you follow the site they provide. The app required is called CloudEdge App. A microSD card (up to 128GB is required to record videos when the sensor detects movement).Battery- Manual states the camera has a built in 10,400mAh 18650 battery which can be used for 3-6 months assuming the camera wakes up to 15 times a day playing video only 10 minutes. There is a solar panel option for fully wireless charging. I could see this thing being used for a high tech trail camera.I was able to set up the camera while still being connected to a charging cable. So I guess you could use it as a wired camera? The app set up had voice prompts which was nice. It walks you through the setup and you enter your wifi password into the app. The app generates a QR code, you then point the camera towards your phone and the camera will snap a picture of the code to configure itself. MUCH better and faster than having to log into the camera and toggle back and forth. The longest part for me was pulling up my Wi-Fi password since it is long and complex.Video quality is acceptable. App has nice features such as battery life and status. It will also show the signal strength and mac and IP address. You can save to the cloud or use the app to access video files saved on the micro SD card. You can also live stream on demand as well as receive notifications.The box says the camera is ""IP weatherproof"" but does not list the rating. I would say it would be safe to be outdoors but I would not trust it to be in full rain. I would be more worried about water entering through the antennas as well as the speaker. The buttons, sd card and charging slot are protected by a well fitting rubber cover.",,7069,1,https://www.amazon.com/Zumimall-Rechargeable-Surveillance-Detection-Waterproof/dp/B07X27WDVM/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=security+cameras+without+subscription&qid=1640229824&sr=8-16

There are some drawbacks to getting a WiFi monitor vs a traditional one that I will get into later. But here are some of the features.Picture Quality:Far superior then traditional and more than adequate. No need to install another monitor just for camera, i can just access the camera via wifi from anywhere and it is so easy, even for someone have limited knowledge about technology.Viewing monitor:We use our phones to check which works great. The quality of picture came out clearly and the night vision mode works completely better than our old system which is much more expensive and more complicate to install.User Access and setupSome other comment mentioned how 2 different phones can’t both check at the same time so I wanted to mention that’s completely wrong. In wansview cloud view, you can create multiple accounts that can access/view/replay really easy. You can share the camera access to anyone that have the wansview app and they can check it, all the setup process can be complete in just a few minutes.PriceCompare to my old system which costs me almost $3k and hours to setup, wansview camera came in very handy and extremely affordable at $40 (free shipping and free return policy) and all my family can easily find this system is so easy to use. What a stealing deal.","My wife and I bought this camera for the upcoming holiday season where we tend to buy a lot of stuff by mail for gifts. We live in an urban setting, bigger city on a main street with no lock box, just a little door slot for mail. We've had packages stolen before and we just want that added security. I set it up right away. It was very easy to set up. Literally 10 minutes out of the package and it was hooked up. Now we just need to mount it. We tested it out with the video and you get a month of storage free with the app. Then you can either pay by month, quarterly or annually. Theres a free option too but not much storage. It's really affordable. I believe 7 bucks a month or 69.99 for the year for up to 3 cameras. (There are other plans and offers for even more cameras and storage as well) After seeing that it works great we are actually going to purchase 2 more for around the house and back building. You never can be too safe this day and age.It does have to be plugged in so it's hardwired not wireless camera, but does work through Wi-Fi. Also it's good to note that the app only works on 2.4 speed and not 5.0. I'm glad that our fast internet package gave us 2 separate lines so we have both. We were very impressed on what it picked up even in the dark when we took the red light off the camera. It would start recording every time my son would roll side to side sleeping in the morning while we tested it out as grandpa came to babysit the kids for my wifes morning appointment and while I was off to work. All in all I'm very impressed. Will update to see how it lasts through the winter and outside.","This camera works great for my use, and at a fantastic price value. Set up was easy on my cell phone, and it has a Windows app, too. I use it to monitor my front yard and door when I'm away. It has adjustable motion detection and alerts me on my cell phone immediately when it senses something. I just click on the alert and the video comes right up. I can view it or optionally download it to my phone. It stores about 10 seconds of video for each motion detected, starting before the motion was detected. I haven't yet figured out if I can adjust that record period.It also offers / encourages cloud usage by subscription (with free trial), and I've seen some complaints about that. But it isn't required, at least not for what I'm doing. I haven't done the trial and it's still storing my Alarm videos just fine. It seems that Cloud usage would be helpful for continual monitoring and additional feathers, but I don't need that. Very nice camera!","I received the Wansview W4 outdoor camera a few weeks ago in exchange for my unbiased review. It came well packaged with easy to follow instructions and a packet of materials (e.g.: screws, anchors) which cover most installations.Setup: This is not my first Wansview camera, so the app was already downloaded and is pretty user friendly (once you get the hang of the QR reader Wi-Fi setup). Wansview does give the option for cloud storage, which is convenient for those who require it, or you can store clips and images locally on your device.Installation: This device must be connected to continuous power and battery operation is not an option. I had an outdoor outlet in the location where I planned to install the device which made things easy, but this is surely something to consider. The option to connect via ethernet or Wi-Fi is also a nice feature if your installation is set up to be hardwired with ethernet. The three cords that extend from the rear of the camera (power, ethernet, and reset button) are a bit bulky, but can be managed during install. The antenna has several degrees of freedom but can get in the way depending on your installation location. In my case, I mounted the camera on the underside of an eave rather than the side of a wall. Thankfully, Wansview has thought of this and allows you the option of flipping the video orientation if you must mount the camera with the antenna facing down.Video Quality & Integrity: The images are high quality day and night, especially for the price point. I experienced acceptable lag and good stream integrity. The camera only connects to 2.4 GHz bands, so depending upon your provider and Wi-Fi coverage, bandwidth could present a problem with lag and stream integrity.Features: The app allows you to activate motion detection and alerts. This is convenient but does not apply for my application. You can share access to the camera via the Wansview app with many users (e.g.: family members, employees, etc).Pros:Value (This is multiple pros wrapped up in one with good quality and functionality at a reasonable price.)Reliable (Thus far, no issues with loss of connectivity or needs to reboot the camera since installation.)Option to expand to cloud based storage at an additional cost. Probably most useful if you have multiple Wansview cameras.May be controlled by Alexa.Waterproof.Cons: (Only apply to certain applications)The camera does provide audio or a talk back feature. This is something to be aware of to limit disappointment if you require this functionality for your application.The location of the antenna could potentially impact your installation plans, but there is a significant degree of possibilities here to make it work (e.g.: degrees of freedom in the mount and antenna, as well as ability to flip the image).No native or expandable storage in the camera itself.Overall:A good value waterproof outdoor camera with night vision that is appropriate for most applications that do not require audio or talk back features.",This Camera is great. Having 2 older wansview outdoor cameras they were good and but had some minor issues with motion detection and switching night/day vision. But they have corrected these issues with the wansview w4 camera. I now get great 10 second video clips sent to the cloud with really good picture quality. It was easy to set up. After having these for the last several days these are perfect. I recommend getting these cameras. They aren’t that expensive which is another major plus. I think they did great with this one.,6500,1,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Surveillance-Waterproof-Detection-Compatible/dp/B07WNLB2RG/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=security+cameras+without+subscription&qid=1640229824&sr=8-20

Watching Remotely works great. BUT...,Big things come in small packages.,Great Security Cameras for a Wireless Solution,So far so good.,"I love innovative tech gadgetry, so just based on the design and innovation on this camera it already gets high marks from me. I was looking for a rechargeable IP camera that I could install in a location away from a power-source. As such, I was willing to periodically change or charge the battery, but having a solar-panel makes that step unnecessary.There is an additional feature to this camera that I did not expect. The solar panel connects to the camera via a micro-USB cable. This is great because if I ever get power to the location where it’s installed, I can opt to go with a wired power-source. Also, should there ever be a need to top off the battery; I have a way of easily doing that.Overall, the camera was very easy to set-up. It uses a barcode generated on the app to pass along your information to the camera after you've signed up and created an account. All of that process and function is pretty standard, where this camera stands out is in its quality construction and design.Two of the features I’d like to point out are the power-port cover and the magnetic mount. The ports for the power, reset, and microSD card are all covered by a thick rubber seal/lid that is built into the connection from the solar panel. As you can see in my photo, once you connect the panel, everything is sealed up very well. I do wonder why the lens doesn’t have a visor or some other protective measure around it though.The magnetic mount is an ingenious way to mount the camera and be able to position it in nearly limitless angles and positions. There must be a pretty strong magnet housed inside the camera behind the rubber indentation. When coupled to the metallic-looking half-ball, it seats perfectly and very securely.The only thing I’d change or add to this setup is a bead of silicone along the glass/frame edge of the solar panel. Mine didn’t come with anything there that resembled a seal, so I did just that and now I feel much better about the durability of the panel in wet weather.","The cameras were easy to install - took minutes to get them installed. Connecting to WiFi was a challenge not because of the camera but because I forgot my WiFi passcode. Once I put the right WiFi passcode, it connected in seconds.The solar charge also works great - I installed in a sunny area and the cameras are always 100% charged, thanks to mother nature power (solar).Remote viewing is very quick and the cameras are clear. I can also hear the wind sound and birds chirping if near by. I even checked from across the globe and it worked flawlessly.I get Alert texts all the time as the cameras are sensitive - the alerts show ""Body Movement"" but the problem is, I could never see the playback. When I play the message back, it keeps connecting slowly and keeps giving me a message that network is slow - not sure why I could see live but network is slow for playback. After few attempts, I get a picture that is barely usable - it is so bright it is washed out. There is no video either. For this reason, the video playback is useless for me.","PHonestly I have to say I wasn’t expecting much out of this camera since it was fairly cheap. The package arrived within two days thanks to prime so I was really excited to install this as soon as possible. I plan on putting this camera in an area that doesn’t have WiFi and only utilize the sd card recording function. For the next few days however I will be leaving this camera in an area close to another camera I have to better judge the quality of it since I’ve had these other cameras for about 2 years or more. Upon opening the package I found more hardware than I could ever have guessed, I knew it came with a normal mount and a double sided sticky tape mount but it has so many options I plan on utilizing two of them during my testing phases before leaving it in its permanent home ( I ordered the solar panel option). I charged the camera over night before testing it since I’ve read some reviews about needing to be charged first and the manual does say charge for at least 15 minutes. The manual is very clear which is a breath of fresh air considering how many cameras either only come with a note card size instruction sheet or make you find some weird website online that doesn’t even exist anymore. For the little I spent on this I am still at shock at how much stuff came with this camera. The camera has an intercom function which is really cool. I will definitely utilize this if I do decide to put it in range of my WiFi for its permanent home but I have enough cameras already around my house so if you are looking for something like that then this is the way to go. The night vision is very sensitive to low light situations but I prefer that since the picture quality isn’t hindered like my other cameras during night vision mode. The WiFi range is similar to a phone which is better than I expected but I will experiment with range later one since I’m not really concerned with that.Overall I am very pleased, I’m interested to see how the solar panel will work with charging the battery. I don’t plan on leaving it out all year since I’m going to be changing out the sd card anyway and charging every so often isn’t that big of a deal.Out of the box I have to say this product has definitely made me a happy costumer, I’ve had people already ask me about recommendations on cameras similar to this and I definitely will be telling them how pleased I am so far. Only time will tell in the long run how great a camera is but if it catches a trespasser even once, it has payed for itself.","I picked up two of these cameras which included the solar panels instead of all the other options out there due to the 100% wireless factor.I didn't want to fuss with charging or replacing batteries and was skeptical at first, but after a week of ownership, I think we have a winner.Along with my order of the two cameras, I also picked up two 64gb micro SD cards. I didn't want to pay for a cloud service and am being responsible for my own storage.I read that the 128gb cards was overkill and that sentiment was true. In fact, 64gb SD cards may be overkill but at $16 for two, no biggy.After unpacking, I installed the SD cards and charged each camera with the provided cords overnight.With both cameras at 100%, I connected them to the Cloud Edge app and formatted the SD cards.I installed one camera at the front and one camera at the back of my house along with the solar panels on my roof.I am happy to say that after a full week of use, both cameras still show 100% charged on the CloudEdge app. The solar panels work!!!The cameras are sensitive to motion, which can be adjusted slightly, but if a humming bird or large bug (grasshopper in my case) flys in front of the cameras, they will record.You can set the default record time from 20 seconds to 40 and 60 if you like.Each alert instance sometimes comes through twice, one showing two screen shots and one showing video. I'm still not sure why I received two different alerts sometimes, but I can live with it.You can view a live feed which includes audio and two way communication which is nice. During the live feed you can take screen shots and record video on the fly.The video is good, but not great. Meaning... If the person is up close, it's very clear, but if the person is more than 10ft away, it's not a crisp picture. Deducted 1 star for that.Night vision works well, but as expected, not as clear as during the day but still acceptable. Deducted 1 star for that.The recording volume is very sensitive and picks up birds chirping in the background as well as any noises you would hear if present.The back of the solar panels are white, so I spray painted them black to blend better with my roof.I wish the solar panel cords came in white to match my rain gutters and wood siding.I like that you can turn off the motion sensors from the app for when you are home as to not trigger the alerts to your phone all day.IMO, these cameras are worth the price for a wireless solution. In fact, I may buy a 3rd just to hide somewhere indoors...just in case.","Seller was very helpful and prompt in getting me set up. Once I was up and running the cameras are working as advertised. Video and sound quality are good. It helps to have fast internet speed to reduce video delays. All cameras are outside (haven't installed inside ones yet) and was able to place where I wanted which, in one case, was over 50' from my router. The cameras with the solar panels are like having wired connections - always powered. Still playing around and will follow up.Update: Seller, again, was very helpful. Even sent me a couple of mounts for the solar panel that I had broken during installation. Also, it was suggested that I tilt downward the angle on the camera to capture movement, which worked better.Next Update: I dropped my camera twice from a height of at least 10' when mounting from the deck. First time it hit the ground, and the next time it hit concrete. Bottom line, the camera still works although the lens cracked after the second time. Mfg. said they would replace the camera...which is way above and beyond good customer service. I just wanted to tell them how durable the camera was. Update: just received the replacement camera.",2269,404,https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Rechargeable-Security-Detection-Waterproof/dp/B07V1C2YDZ/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=security+cameras+without+subscription&qid=1640229824&sr=8-15

The clarity is great and they are very easy to install. We had a small hiccup with one of the lenses and the company was wonderful about replacing it. I had a new camera within two days. Great customer service!,"I must say this camera system is awesome, the WIFI coverage is great, really powerfull. Mi home is about 400 sq/ft and the signal is really strong, I have been using it for a month and I haven't lost signal at all.The system is really Plug N play, very simple and the manual is very detailed. It has all the steps in order to set up the cameras.I would definetley recommend this camera system.(The one I purchased is the 4 cameras and NVR with screen) the screen is very convinient.","To start with I gave Tech Support 3 stars simply because I have not had to contact them. From the quality of this system and the excellent response I received from Hiseeu concerning the pre-purchase discount code and a few questions about the two units I was considering I feel any assistance I might need will be satisfactorily handled.This is a pretty straight forward setup, but I had already set up a similar system from a different manufacturer last year. My experience is this system truly is basically plug and play.My only ""complaint"" is the product description states one way audio and my cameras do not have audio. That is no big deal to me. If I feel the need to have audio on a camera I will simply buy an additional camera with audio.I also have found the motion detection sensitivity setting tricky. I do not want to record constantly nor during specific time periods. I only wish to record when a camera detects movement. It appears to me this system has specific settings, ie. ""Highest"", ""Medium"", down to ""Lowest"" with no agility to fine tune the setting. My other system has a sliding percentage ability to set sensitivity infinitely. This is not a major flaw just something I need to experiment with to find a happy medium.The power supply cords are about 10 feet long so plan on your placement before you start and make certain to purchase power extension cords as they make your install go so much quicker. I have 12 cameras between the 2 systems and using the power extension cords I only had to install 2 new outlets. These power extensions cords come in a bunch of different lengths. I purchased several from 6 foot to 30 foot. They are not expensive and much easier than running an entirely new electrical circuit. I would NOT recommend using a regular cheapo extension cord. The power extension cords are designed specifically for this purpose. Also remember to at least wrap a high quality electrical tape around each connection to help keep moisture out. I used electrical shrink wrap personally, but I'm kinda anal about this stuff.This system truly has a lot of features for the cost. The build quality looks very good. Picture quality is great, even at night. One of my cameras in the front is directed towards our yard light and that camera records in color at night. The cameras are made of aluminum not plastic. I experimented and discovered my original system cameras (which look as though they were made at the same factory) will easily pair to this system and vice versa. Hiseeu also makes a compatible PTZ camera that, I do not have one but have read, pairs to this system.I believe I will get several years of quality surveillance from this system.June 16, 2020 UpdateI for got to mention in my original review that I had absolutely no issues setting up remote access on my Android phone using the IPPRO APP. This APP allows me to view either of my 2 systems with one account. I love that ability to ""check in"" while away from home. I live in Florida and was able to ""see"" my system from Illinois last fall. It's is very easy to setup and connection/viewing is only limited to the internet speed you are using.","This is second time I contacted support and got very quick reply, the first time was on weekend. This second support was for a failed hard drive. Within few hours after sending email to support, they shipped me a new high-end replacement and received it 2nd day. When I pulled the original HDD out I could see it too was high-end HDD. The replacement was easy.","I had been skeptical at first but after series of reading and comparing, I found this product to be the best so far. I went ahead and purchased, It didn't take me long to figure out how to match the cameras and all that stuff ( self explanatory) considering that Im not an electronics person but I figured out anyway in no less than an hour. My husband and my brother had it going in a couple of hours. The picture quality amazed me, so clear and the audio is perfect compared to our previous ones. I just loved the fact that it's so easy to install, no sweat. The only minor problem I encountered is one of the cameras has poor wifi signal pick up, though it came with a signal extender I kind of gotten confused so I reached out to the tech support thru email. Johny, got back with me so fast! I didn't quite expect that, I got the answer to my question right away.

Amazon MAKES it right,Best investment I've ever made for the price.,Wireless!,Great wireless camera!,Clear video and sound,"Geeni makes a great product and has an easy to use app, one of the best, in my opinion.follow up...one camera stopped charging 100% (purchased in Oct 2020), called/emailed Geeni...HORRIBLE customer support, non existent and just gives you the run around...i talked to Amazon customer service.....THEY BLEW IT OUT OF THE WATER for support...thank YOU Amazon..Geeni, you need to take some support classes from Amazon customer support",This is the best little camera. I've had it up for over three weeks now and the camera battery is only down to 50%. I'll pull it down and charge it once it hits about 20%. The camera was hung upside down but it was super nice that I was able to rotate live and captured views. I love it when I'm gone and I get a notification that somethings delivered and I can see that on my iPhone. Also I can log into the app and see whatever's going on in a nice-sized area. Night vision is excellent. The sound is excellent. And I can even speak to whomever is outside from wherever I'm located and I'm also able to record what's going on if I choose to do so. Best investment I've ever made.,"Picture/video quality just as good as the more expensive cameras I've used. No need for a power source; built in battery. Depending on location/settings, battery life varies greatly. Advertises up to 3 months per charge. The one on my girlfriend's front porch (Busy street/high sensitivity.) needs to be charged every 4 weeks. The one on her mom's house (Busy street/low sensitivity.) will probably go about two months. The third at my mother's (Country/high sensitivity) will go the full 3 if not longer.Night vision is great! Easy setup using the Geeni app. The ability to share your camera feed with others. All cameras are in my Google Home and function nicely. Comes with a magnetic and screw-on mount; I've used both, but prefer the magnetic mount as the screw-on mount seems a little cheap.",Great picture quality and motion detection. I’ve had the camera about a month and still have 90% battery. Easy installation!!!,"Cons, Clear images and videos with clear and loud sound. Takes a couple hours to fully charge but battery lasts for a long time. Sensor catches everything including squirrels and cats. Free app to download.

Everything came as it should and it took me a day to mount and wire up all the camera's. It took me another few hours just to get all the angles right and to move one to different location. Once I had it up and running it took me only a little bit to figure out how to get it running and recording. The main unit is about a 12"" x 12"" and everything hooks up nice. It comes with a 1Terabite drive and was easy to get formatted and recording. One thing I would say to all, is let it keep the default image resolution settings. If you try to go higher than the camera's will handle, it will cause it to reboot and start all over. I hooked this up to a older TV with the HDMI connection and it stays on at all times right above my computer desk.My real worry was the quality of the camera's. Truthfully I don't think they are 720p camera's myself. If you try to make the image large the image is a bit blurry and unstable. Not the kind of unstable that would make it not be usable but if you have watched a 720p video it's a lot better than this. But that aside, the quality is much better than the older style systems you used to get, and for the money it's worth it. The biggest plus to this system is the night vision. This to me is where this system really shines. The camera goes Black and White when it gets too dark and the images are not awesome, but better than anything I have seen on any of my work systems. They really do show about 65 feet in the pitch dark and though it is a bit grainy you can still make out anything moving out there. I can even see my dog when he goes out to do his thing : pThe peace of mind from having this system is worth every penny. We had some prowlers before we got this messing with our water lines and this is why we purchased this unit. If they ever come back, their gonna get a nice ride and three meals and a cot.Also just a helping hint. The joints to the camera's are sturdy, but if you try to tighten the locking clamp by twisting the camera body you will break the joint. So don't be tempted. Get a pair of Channel Locks and hold the camera and then tighten the lock ring, not super tight but snug. You can thank me later : )","I ordered this system. It arrived super fast and communication with the vendor has been excellent. My plan was to power up the system on the kitchen table and let it run for 4 or 5 days to become familiar with it and verify that it works. I figured being Amazon I could send it back if it didn't live up to expectations. So far, so good.I have been running this system in one configuration or another for more than two months now and have not regretted the purchase. The quality and software capabilities far exceed my expectations at this price point. My only complaint on it so far is the remote app for android. My problems with it are outlined below. Since I am not that interested in remote viewing this is not an issue for me.I have NOT been given a discount for this equipment as some reviewers so the comments below are strictly my own.1-4-17Received the system and wired everything except WIFI and video out. Everything worked well on initial power up. Easy setup with the Wizard. Good clear image for each camera. As night approached and the lights turned off I checked night vision. I don't know what it will do for long distance but in the house in total darkness, 15 feet away I could easily see a person move and what they were wearing. I could not make out details of the face.1-5-17I let system run all night and recording worked fine. Today I opened the DVR to see how it was built.The hard drive is a Toshiba 1 TB 6 GB/s SATA drive. My plan is to install a larger drive so that when we are on vacation we can have two weeks of saved video. I can then use this drive as a backup drive in my server.There is a small cooling fan on the left as you are looking at the front of the unit. There is a good size heat sink on the main chip. I plan to install the DVR on its side so the fan should be up with space on bottom ( right side of unit ) to assure air flow.There are three USB connectors. One on the front of the DVR and two on the back. A mouse comes with the system. I tested it with a wireless mouse but it would not work because you couldn't load a driver for it. The two other USB ports can be used for a backup drive and a wireless dongle.There is also an RJ45 LAN port on the back. I plugged a Cisco bridge into it to connect to my wireless LAN. Entered the password and connected with no issues. I ended up running an Ethernet cable from the RJ45 port to my router. I had some issues getting the remote access app to work with wireless. Not sure if that was the reason.Also a BNC video out connector. Not tested yet but my plan is to run this to my video distribution system so that I can view the cameras on any TV in the house.I had an issue with one of the indoor cameras. I moved the camera on its gimbal mount too far and some of the silicone tubes popped out. My error for moving it so much. I attempted to put them back but they would not stay in place and there was no way to get a dab of glue in there. Then I read the camera instructions ( yes, I should have done that first ) and learned that you can disassemble the camera to mount it to the ceiling. Now I can re glue the silicone pieces. One helpful point is that the instructions say to unscrew the bottom part of the mount. I grabbed the two pieces to unscrew and they would not budge. The trick I learned was hold the two parts very gently and wiggle them in a counterclockwise motion.1-7-17I set a fixed IP address on the DVR and when I go to the browser on my computer on the LAN and type in that IP address I can view the cameras and change any of the settings. This means I won't need a monitor or mouse connected to the DVR and it can be better hidden. It doesn't do you much good to DVR the bad guys and then have them steal the DVR.Installed the app SECU365 as recommended by Zosi. My Norton AV said there was no risk. After it installed it appeared to install something else and all of a sudden Norton said it sent data back to China and was a privacy issue. Considering that this is a view into my home I'm very concerned about anyone hacking into this. It may be safer to forego the remote view. If anyone has info on a different app that is known to be safer please leave a comment.Also a note on the silicone bumpers on the indoor cameras. After regluing they fell out again while installing on ceiling. The camera still held in the position I set it so it wasn't a big deal. Just annoying. I plan to replace the silicone tubes with something different on the next camera I install.3-2-17We have had some milder winter weather in our area so I was able to get all the wiring run in the attic and the outdoor cameras installed. I had a minor problem with one of the outdoor cameras and the vendor responded quickly and took care of the problem. I have been very happy with the quick response on any issue from the seller!With all 8 cameras running full time but not recording any audio I am able to record a few hours less than 2 weeks of video. I have not done much with learning to use the motion detection or the time out for the cameras feature. I would guess that I will get more than 2 weeks of video by only recording motion. I will write more on this topic later when I have more time.One thing I learned was that you can only save video clips out through the front panel USB port. I should have learned this before I installed the system because I had to use a 90 degree USB adaptor and a short cable to access the port.As mentioned before I can view live video, review recorded video, copy recorded video to the front panel USB and change any of the configuration settings from my Win7 browser. I wish there was a way to copy a portion of a recording to my local Win7 drive through the browser. I am planning to write to support if a firmware update would allow to do this or any other features. I will write more on this at a later time.",,"It is lowest cost for such a security system even buying the hard drive separate, and I put a 2TB hard drive and only used 2 of the 4 cameras so I got two more for spares.The instructions are lacking so it takes a little (just a little) ingenuity to figure out things like the red light is power and the green light means the videos are activated and working, and ""play back"" only means play back while we have to go to the main menu and click ""backup"" in order to copy a file onto a flash-drive. The red icon means no sound but this DVR can install a microphone if our State does not object. The small yellow lighted icon is for the motion detector coming on, but even with motion detection the videos are recording 24 hours every day constantly so it gives full coverage.The infrared comes out black-n-white but it is brilliant how it lights up the entire yard like a strobe light and yet completely invisible to our human eyes, except for the little red glow of the infrared around the face of the camera.I attached mine to one of my HDMI's on my TV so to watch a live view outside then I just change from TV over to the HDMI and there it is constantly live monitoring but when I turn away from that HDMI then the TV does not show the video so it harms nothing.I mounted one camera inside but I do not want inside on full time monitoring so I put the power wire hanging loose and so if I ever want the camera inside to start working then I just reach down and push together the loose power cord and then the inside camera comes on only at my comand.I am very happy with this.","Picture quality is great, use of the DVR is pretty straight-forward, and overall I'm very happy with these (especially for the price! I just could not ding a star for two minor issues (below) given the price of this system).Hooked up the app to my phone and now I can see the house while away.Customer service is spot on. I had a hiccup of my own doing and they were quick to respond via email to get me sorted. I sent pictures of my issues, they sent answers. Got me running fast!Setup: mostly easy except the camera assembly has swivel issues. There are two screws that keep the barrel in place that prevent it from easily fine-tuning the angle of the picture after install (see picture). But, loosen those screws and turn the barrel, tighten again, and it does work; it's just not easy at the top of a ladder.Cables: the cable lengths were great - got everywhere I needed them with ease. But, the cable connectors are different lengths (see picture). A bit OCD sure, but try to put them in electrical tape or outdoor tape and you have a lump.Grab a 2TB Storage Drive, also on Amazon, and this is a perfect system for install and walk away.https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IMPO5MO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1Again, for the price, you can't beat this.

It works very well. I needed something to catch the rotten kids in my complex when they play ding-dong ditch. Funny, I haven't had any issues with them since installing it lol. It gave me peace of mind when we were out of town recently so that I could see my neighbor take my dog in and out when she was caring for her. It also told me when packages arrived so she could get them for me. And, it caught FedEx being naughty when my package was tossed at my doorstep, tsk task tsk lol. It is easy to set up, and download the app and you can even talk to someone with it when they're right by your door. Although I don't have a memory card in it, it's an option for those who want it. You can change the sensitivity settings to catch as much or as little movement as you need. I can't comment on the night vision aspect of it since I have a light by my door that comes on when the sun goes down that is bright enough to see everything. You can see the pictures are quite clear and detailed, even the one from the night picture even with the light on. I recommend this to anyone who needs simple, discreet security.",,"I was skeptical about a camera that operates only on battery and claims of 30+ day battery life but I've been pleasantly surprised. Using it 30 days battery is still at 76%, I suspect with more motion it will use more battery, I've had little motion. Detection and notification is nearly instantaneous but you won't be able to review the notifications if you don't have a micro SD card in it (not included).I can't comment on how it is outdoors as mine is indoors, but the night vision reflecting off walls lights up the entire room evenly. You can hear audio live and in the recording which I have little experience with but I can hear a TV on it so it's pretty sensitive. I haven't used the talking through it feature, but that it something you can do.I'll keep this one around in a location I want to capture but don't want to run wires.","I didn't want to get a Ring doorbell, but I wanted to be able to monitor my front porch for package pirates. I didn't have any experience with security cameras, and didn't want to spend a lot of money. This one seemed to have a lot of bang for the buck, and so far it's been really impressive.Pros: Seems solid and well made. Image quality is outstanding. Easy to mount. Easy to connect to wifi. Mine is under a protected porch so it's not an issue but they claim it's waterproof and by the looks I would say that's true.Cons: None really, but some things to know: It does not come with a memory card, so if you want to capture video you'll need one. Otherwise it stores still images. It was easy to connect to the wifi when I was next to the router, but make sure you have a decent signal where you intend to put it. I would say the app is pretty good but I wish I could view landscape. If you want to continuously monitor video then be aware that decreases battery life (this would be true of all cameras).

Out of the box the picture quality was just Ok. Only a few issues with picture being to bright or fuzzy. I then went through the menus and found all kinds of setting to mess with. After a few days and nights of adjusting and a lot of online reading I was able to get the quality up to 1080p standards. The only complaint I would have is that is doesn’t come with a book telling you what all the settings do. And even today. There are a few I still can’t figure out. I have it set up to continually record and I am not using any online streaming programs or the motion detection. I just recently bought 2 more cameras to add to the system. Overall I am really happy with it. Can’t beat the price anywhere.There were some reviews that I read before I bought it that made me think it’s not any good but I still went with it. People complaining about it rebooting all the time just never found the setting to disable auto reboot maintenance. You can also back up important videos with a flash drive, you don’t need the internet plugged in at all. You can also update via the usb with a flash drive. And if you do buy this system or any other system, don’t forget that you need to regularly clean the cameras lens to keep your picture quality good. I clean min about twice a month unless we get a lot of rainfall and or dusty windy weeks. I have already recommended this system to two of my friends.After about a month I started having issues with the dvr. The hard drive started showing errors and wasn’t recording. The playback was freezing and everything was running sluggish. I got ahold of Hiseeu and got helped right away. They said my dvr probably had a defected board. They quickly sent out another dvr and even gave me a free upgrade to 8ch dvr. The hard drive got formatted on my pc and I put it right in. Works so well I think I will have to order a few more cameras. Hiseeu’s customer service was amazing. Talked to them about my issues on Thursday and I had my replacement on Saturday.","Initially I wasn't expecting very much from this product based on the price.However, after using it for a while I found this product to be of excellent quality. It met and exceeded my expectations and had many features and abilities. I was not expecting.I had it for a short while and then I experienced a problem with the hard drive. I contacted the vendor and they responded with courtesy and in a very timely manner. They sent me a new hard drive and installed and have been using and enjoying this product very much. It is a very good product for the money. Based on my experience with this vendor I would have to say that it is a very high quality company. I think you should know that.",i love how the performance of this product exceeded beyond my highest expectstions. it is as said in the description your get more value fir your money. And not only thwt you will get too of the line customer service stress free no bs customer service and its stress freee they will replace defective item guaranteed .,"This system is awesome! No, its not the top of the line, but for your money, you are getting a great value because this system is comparable to the best. No, its not 1080P, but the description states 1080N. Still, a very crisp video. Bottom line, I know I got a great DVR and cameras for my money. Oh, did I mention their fantastic customer care and service? They contacted me and wanted to make sure I was pleased with my purchase.",I found it easy to set up and install. There was a video i mean a lot of videos explaining how to install if you have any doubt on what to do. Many options and sensitivity settings for up to 8 cameras. Night visions works great also. Wires were long enough to hide from front of house to back where my cable tv enters the house. The other 3 cameras were closer so i didn't need to purchase the 100ft extension. I had to make the hole bigger of course since the connectors were pretty large ( my only complaint ). Only took a few couple hours to install since i took my time hiding the wires and attaching the cameras. It helps to have a staple gun for holiday lights for the wires. The app you can download to view the cameras on my phone works a lot better than i expected.,496,171,https://www.amazon.com/Hiseeu-Security-Surveillance-Waterproof-Detection/dp/B07D3SYFKH/ref=sr_1_37_sspa?keywords=security+cameras+without+subscription&qid=1640229828&sr=8-37-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEySUowNTFKSVlOV1RGJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDc4ODc5U0cyRk5LWTNZMzRHJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA0NzM1MjhGRTNFWFk3NzRKS1cmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9idGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl

The picture is better than the blink, really clear HD, and the movement makes it great to use to check up on the puppy as she sometimes sleeps in corners. The price and ease of use is great as well. Only negative is that when operating the camera movement remotely, it does make a semi loud noise (for a dog at least). She hears it move and it sets her off barking lol. But other than that, great product. Glad we got it!","This camera is great!!It moves to where You want it and it has a zoom.

I can see it with an app on my phone and even move it around. It has a microphone that lets me hear what's going on. Crazy. That one surprised me. It can record video but I haven't really gotten into that. I'm not doing either of those. So, cool camera.

This is the one!,Can't Beat the Quality or Ease of Installation At This Price,Great home system - REALLY Easy Setup!!!,Still love it after 2 years of ownership,Really easy setup!,"If you have need of a security camera system this is the one. I spent hours researching and checking out different systems in person. Overall this system stood out significantly over others.Pros:- higher resolution. This is so extremely important. Higher the resolution means that you can see identifying information from further distances. Most systems stop at HD 1080 or 720. Reolink takes is another step past that.- PoE. Power over Ethernet allows extremely fast install as you only have one cable to run for the signal back to the recorder AND power. It also means that any holes you need to cut in your walls are much smaller.- The quality of the Ethernet cable is very nice, very flexible and easy to pass through tight spaces.- Multiple ways to access the video feed. Bring able to use my laptop/desktop, phone, tablet, or the Reolink recorder to access the interface and recordings is really nice. Especially when it came time to position the cameras. Bring able to see the camera view in my phone made the process a cinch.- The motion tracking system is great for maximising the recording time and minimising unneeded recordings and alerts.- Plenty of other cameras for specific needs that are 100% compatible and just plug.- Lots of extra ports for more camerasCons: ( these are rather minimal)- mounting screws strip very easily. This is a very common problem with screws in general now days. I really suggest not bothering with the included ones and great a pack of number 6 wood screws- Setting the motion sensitivity is a little tricky. Not really a complaint, but it does take a fair amount of tinkering to get it right for your needs. I suggest taking your time and don't expect to get it correct the first time.",This review also applies to these additional Reolink cameras I purchased along with this system: ,"Received promptly with two extra dome cameras, as ordered. This is my third system - same location, just keep upgrading to new, better technology. My initial reaction is that this is a great system for home surveillance. I haven't disconnected and replaced the existing one yet but it should be easy as I was already using Ethernet cables (but I had to put converter baluns at each end - now I can just remove those and use existing cat5 and cat 6 cables). But I have fired it up on my desk and connected it to internet and all 10 cameras to be sure all was working.I have to say, while I'm pretty techie and have set up two prior systems, I was AMAZED at how simple and fast it was to set this up for access on my home network PC's, and on my iPhone and iPad. I used a DDNS internet setup in the past but did not need it for this system. It basically just set itself up once I downloaded the PC program and the iOS apps. I refuse to buy anything that has to use the manufacturer's website for internet access - with or without a fee. This works purely over internet with no need to go through REOLINK's servers - perfect! Some other popular brands are not so flexible.Cameras appear way more clear and sharp than my existing system. I ordered 2 extra cameras - the RLC-422 dome cameras with zoom. I have zoom cameras now but you have to use a small screwdriver at the camera to change the zoom to suit the location. I was surprised to find that these can be zoomed remotely using the software. Very nice - and focus adjusts automatically when zoom is changed.Came with virtually everything I needed - you'll want to get a small monitor to connect to the NVR (I got a lightweight 21.5"" HDMI full HD monitor for about $100 that sits nicely on top of the NVR) as my existing one was ancient technology.I did upgrade the NVR firmware to one released less than a month ago - very easy to do but be aware that it will take around 45 minutes with no indication of progress. I was about to e-mail their support when it beeped that it was done and then re-started. Had to re-enter all of the set-up info. so do this before you get too far into things.So far, I'm very happy with this purchase, especially for the price - a good value compared to other more advertised brands.","Updated: I've had this for 2 years and still love it. It's indispensable for keeping my farm animals safe, seeing what's going on around the property day and night. Our setup is 16 cameras with total 2500 feet of cable; The cameras have been out in the rain, snow, ice, summer heat, dust and still work great.Reolink support has been awesome - only needed them a couple of times over the past 2 years -- first was a mysterious config issue which they diagnosed and solved; the second was last week when the transformer went out. We're out of warranty now but they still helped to diagnose the issue and we're back in action.Just having it out of commission for a few days showed us how much we rely on it. Being able to see that all is well inside the barns at 2am - wonderful. Even have a camera on the homing pigeons (yeah) - so fascinating to see them doing their thing when humans aren't around.We still just sit and watch it. If we have visitors, we all sit and watch it. Ok, that may be weird.Here's my original review --Day 3 and I love it. I started intending to buy 1 camera, bought 8, added 4 more. Now up to 12 and figuring out that I need (ok, want) more. My use is for farm cam to keep an eye on animals, so night vision/audio/POE and being affordable enough for multiple locations were my key purchase requirements. Has already brought invaluable peace of mind, and is just plain fun to watch (yes, we sit watching the security cameras). The color image is very nice; the night vision is great. I have it inside a goat barn, horse barn and pigeon loft and it is very clear even in nighttime low light (when it goes to black & white). I don't know that it would be mug shot level quality, but I do know I can tell which goat is being bad in the dark goat barn now. Also have it on several outdoor areas, where it's color late into the evening.Instructions are simple, but too simple and lacking some detail I would have liked; would have been nice to note somewhere that password needs a number (and special character?). Without any error message, that was just trial and error. Kind of a bummer for first experience with it, but once I was through that bit, everything else was so easy. POE is the way to go. Can't believe I even pondered on that for a day or two like I did. Installing a camera is literally 3 screws, drilling a hole for cable if needed, plugging in the cable on the camera to the ethernet cable, then the ethernet cable to the DVR - done! The DVR defaulted to auto add, so wait a few seconds and the new camera shows up. Maybe I'll put it on the internet sometime (and I can see from other reviewers that can be a project), but for now, straight out of the box and not connected to my network does exactly what I want.Some other notes --1. Another reviewer noted that the trick to audio is to make sure the DVR is set to record audio in addition to the camera being turned on for audio - very helpful.2. I dropped one camera (yes I did) and it wasn't damaged at all. These seem sturdy.3. After figuring out the 3-way articulation, it was easy to set up cameras pointing exactly where I wanted them. Though I went through a phase where things were at various angles (kind of modern art) then realized the barrel rotates too so now everything's level.4. The packaging was hilarious. Did they have a competition to see how much equipment would fit into the smallest box? Everything was well packed and nothing was even out of place. It was just the densest packing job I've seen for a while.5. Really glad I got the 16-channels because now I realize that everything needs to have a camera on it.... meadow, woods, pond....how did we get by without this?6. The night vision gives such a peace of mind; that was one reason I bought this particular camera system. These cameras have 36 IR LEDs, so more than the usual.An added bonus (other than not having to go out to the barn at 2am to check on them) is being able to see the amount of animal stuff that happens when humans aren't around.... fascinating","Had this in place and operational for just under a month now. Upon receipt I tested all the cameras and they all worked, each one was just ""plug and play"", plugged it in and the system saw it and began recording right away. Was really inpress with how easy it was. Ran the cables thru my attic to where I wanted the cameras, installed the camera and everyone of them worked, once again with no problems. Down loaded the app for my android phone from the google play store, and once I enter the appropriate password (that I had assigned) I was able to view each of the installed cameras with no issues at all. This made adjusting the cameras' direction very easy while I was up on the ladder. The app also let me, while reviewing a recorded segment, to copy it to my phone and then email it. Makes it very nice in case you wish to share something you recorded like say with the police. Over all I am very satified with the cameras and NVR. I have all ready purchased a couple of additional cameras to go with my setup. While I have a monitor hooked up to the NVR, for ease I have purchased a 10"" tablet (amazon Fire 10"") and am using it as an wall mounted monitor on the wall near the door, makes it nice to see who's there prior to opening it.Now the cameras that come with it are only 4mp, which works fine for my needs, but the supplied NVR can handle up to 5mp camera if you decide to upgrade later. Just another plus for the system.",958,209,https://www.amazon.com/Surveillance-Supported-Security-Recording-RLK16-410B8/dp/B01C6KUKMY/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=small+security+cameras&qid=1640229747&sr=8-20

Had to reboot the cam twice to get the SIM to activate (not a big deal). Battery is 75%+ every morning and is fully charged on solar every evening. Image quality is great. Android & iPad apps are excellent and easy to use. Motion sensing is slightly lacking as it is a PIR sensor and not image motion recognition. Camera only records motion events triggered by the PIR sensor so if you need constant recording you will need wired cameras and an NVR. Overall I'm very satisfied!,"I bought this camera to monitor a remote renovation project and it works great. No power needed, no wifi required. It works on the rechargable battery & solar panel. At first I bought two tmobile sim cards from a seller on Amazon, but the sim cards would not work and the camera kept saying Sim card Not Recognized. I went to two different Tmobile stores and called customer service (45-minute call) and no one was able to help. I did not want to give up on the camera and I instead decided Tmobile was not the right route for me. I went to Target and picked up a FreedomPop Sim Card $9.99 - Free Basic Plan & GSM SIM Kit and it works great! The set up, from the time of using the FreedomPop was very fast, simple and easy and I am grateful at the quality and ease of the camera. I purchased two of them and would definitely recommend.","Update:changed my rating to 5 stars. The limited sim card options and reception problems are the cell companies issues not the camera manufacturer. The camera works reliably. Just took two days to set it up finding a pre-paid data provider.Also you are able to use an external battery pack to charge your camera.Nick of time! Most importantly be patient, the setup of the sim card is not a breeze it will take time and try your patience. T-mobile prepaid data sim cards are nearly non-existent as they are moving to a different platform. AT&T pre-paid works. What I recommend as steps to follow for setup. 1. Receive your camera/charge the battery right away. 2. Take your camera to the cellular store you plan on using for data. Set it up with the clerk and test it right there before you leave. Now the hard part is done, be sure your carrier is a GSM and supports WCDMA and FDD LTE. DO NOT EXPECT to receive your Amazon box and use the camera right away. I came to use this camera because I was looking for something multifunctional and reliable and I got that. Our old wifi camera died and cellular gives you a lot more flexibility. I was impressed with the solar panel and construction of the camera. I received the camera Tuesday night, set it up Wednesday night, caught the foal being born Thursday morning. Also audio is good and decent battery length. You should have a micro SD card to install right away. Overall a great camera, I'd give it five stars if it was easier to find a sim card that worked with it.",772,112,https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Solar-Powered-Security-Wirefree-Go/dp/B07TKKPTL3/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=small+security+cameras&qid=1640229747&sr=8-16

This is the one!!,ZEEPORTE has redeemed my confidence in wireless security cameras!,Security Camera outdoor,For the price this camera exceeded my expectations.,OUTSTANDING CAMERA!,"My criteria for security cameras is as follows:1) Good quality picture2) Triggers at good distances3) Records videos locally (no monthly fee and privacy)4) Low number of false triggers5) A good phone app to control the cameras and view the videos.6) A reasonable priceThe Zeeporte camera checks all of the above boxes.I'll start here by saying that I've tried Eufy 2C, Vava, and Blink X2C systems. They are all more expensive (and sometimes much more expensive) than the Zeeporte. But the Zeeporte is a superior system to all that I've tried so far.The battery life of this camera is decent. I've used it heavily over the past 6+ days with many tests. I've recorded 209 motions and it is at 89%. Since I've used it heavily, I'll estimate 10% per week which means that it'll last 10 weeks (2.5 months) on a charge. In regards to size of the memory card that you'll need, I've used .22GB of the 120 GB card that I bought. At the current rate, it will record for 1.5 years before getting full - and then I'll just reset it. It is easy to transfer clips to your phone storage (online for my iphone).When I did my testing, I set it to the motion detection sensitivity to the highest value (95). What really impresses me with this camera is the low number of false triggers.. Really, I get none. It records people and cars and that is it. And it does not seem to miss any events. The angle of the camera did affect the distance of the triggering so try different angles.The only area of improvement that I can see is the mount. It is fine, but as I noted in my headline, I've tried several brands now including Eufy, Vava, and Blink. All of these brands had superior mounts, but the one that Zeeporte mount is fine. I had to make sure I tightened it well. One note - the other manufacturers that I listed require base stations and do not record on the camera itself. The Zeeporte does. This means if someone steals your camera, then they will get your videos. So, just don't put your camera within reach. A camera should not be mounted low and the instructions tell you to not do so. This is probably another reason that Zeeporte does not have a magnetic mount.. which would make it easy to steal. The mount that it has requires you to screw it off.Oh.. I just remembered another great feature of the Zeeporte. After your day is finished, you can view the events for the day (and all prior days) in a mode that shows you a timeline and lets you quickly sweep to each event based on the time and watch it. This is really nice to have!Overall, I do recommend it 100%","Last night was a disaster for me as I tried to get another brand of security cam to activate, I spent at least 5 + hours agonizing over the instructions, questioning my own intelligence and more 'Is it me?', I kept asking self.Long story short, it wasn't me, it was the product, and so going to return it.But smartly I ordered two security cams by two different companies and I'm here to say that 'ZEEPORT' has redeemed my happiness and joy and confidence in my ability to set up wireless WIFI connected security cameras...Also I timed it, from time I started activation to time it was up and running and it took less than 25 minutes!...I""m sure those more tech savvy than myself could do it in 15 or 10 minutes or less, I kid you not.Yes I'm a bit emotional cause coming off of a bruising night fooling around with that other security 'dome' camera system, which iI will not name, but if seek out my other review, you may stumble upon it...so yes I'm estatic right now cause ZEEPORTE delivered to me what they promised, a product that works right out of the box, a product to where you don't have to be a computer scientist to figure out, and all along the way, through each step, on your phone there's a 'help tab', in case you need help.Their 'help' doesn't hide from you.In closing, to be honest this can't be considered a totally full review, cause I haven't left my home yet and tried viewing camera from afar, until I do that, only consider this a 50% review.But will say WIFI connection was super easy...I mean super easy, compared to lasts night nightmare with other product (actually it was easy also, but after wifi connected to product their 'network' did not function).Anyways, so far so good with this product and will give another review as soon as can test away from home and see how it does then.It's a outdoor camera, but I have it indoors for now since other products failed me, I will order more though, probably from this brand, we shall see.","I love this camera, it gives great night vision even when my yard light is not on. Motion detection is great it alert me on everything it captures including the garbage man waking me up not to miss my trash guy, The birds in the attic, The neighbour talk. Even when it very windy and something is blowing across the street. Picture quality is absolutely awesome and incredible clear as day light. I call see all three of my neighbors home including mine. The voice quality is very good. If you asked me if I would recommend this camera to anyone else I would not hesitate to yes. I would recommend this to everyone. That's one reason. Why I gave this camera a 5 star. Yes it will video when you tap on the screen to see what going on for as long as you wish. The installation is easy all you have to do is charge for how long the instruction says. I have not charge mine since I put it up and it still has a full battery. This is a great gift and if you live alone and travel it's great to have because you can also put on the away button on your camera. . Ank me again and I will tell I am getting ready to purchase a second one for my home. I wish they came in a double pack. It gives me a piece of mind when I sleep at night to know I am safe. If I could give this camera a 10 out of 10 I would. I surely recommend this to anyone who is looking to purchase a camera for their home.","For my first ever security camera I am highly impressed. I needed a battery operated camera with easy installation and this one is perfect. Set up was easy, it was mostly charged when I received it and I easy drilled it to a tree. WiFi connection is excellent, picture quality is pretty good and the night vision is really good. I noticed the picture quality is better on sunny days rather then really cloudy days. You can change the motion detection, watch live, download videos and delete video all from the free app that you download. Honestly for the price I think I that this camera is pretty awesome and far better then I actually expected. You need a microsd card and to download an app. Other then that everything else is a piece of cake. I would recommend this camera.","I was sceptical at first on purchasing this security camera.I was looking for a really good security camera for the outside of my house.I have simplysafe for my home security system and have there camera as well inside but am not impressed with putting one of there security camera outside of the house.after reading the reviews on this camera.I figured that I would take the chance with it and see how it would perform.after unboxing the camera,and going thru the instructions which were very easy to understand.I figured I would just stick the camera temporarily inside the window seal and see how it would perform, before I mount it.and I must say that I was more then pleased with the clarity of the picture.as you can see from the above pictures.shooting thru the window from the distance that I had it was outstanding. Which I plan to install outside which will work great with my motion lights outhere. As far as the motion sensor it picks up motion great .you can adjust in the setting to suit you,it also has a home mode along with an away mode...as far as battery life I will have to up date in a later review.it came fully charged and seems to be holding pretty good.I must say if you are looking for a really good security camera,I believe you will be more then impressed with this one.Hands down it beats my simply safe cam hands down and for alot less priced.",4677,1,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Rechargeable-Surveillance-Waterproof-Detection/dp/B086V5H1YQ/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=small+security+cameras&qid=1640229747&sr=8-14

I have a tmobile sim card that has worked great.Areas of opportunity:-I do wish it had a removable battery like the reolink go but the other ways to charge it have worked.- If you have more than one reolink camera, you have to update your cloud which is a monthly/annual cost; which I found a bit annoying but the app is great so its been worth it so far.Overall, the picture quality is great and being able to remotely control it through the app has been awesome!","I am extremely happy with this camera / solar panel. I mounted it to the spreader of my sailboat mast using the strap it comes with. I also mounted the solar panel just above it using a zip tie. I did not have to drill any holes in my mast. It has never lost signal, not once! I've been testing it for 2 months now. I can see my boat on the mooring ball using my cell phone anywhere/anytime, I can get alerts if there is an intruder or birds lol, it records when there is motion on the included memory chip. I am blown away at how good it is. I also have another fixed size camera from REOLink inside the boat to see the control panel. That one has been solid as well. I cannot say enough about REOLink!","This is a fantastic camera. The support if awesome too. It took a while to figure things out, but be patient and you may. I found Speedtalk the best sim card provider by far. $8 + $8 per month for 1 GB, which seem to be enough to check camera 2-3 times a day and download some clips here and there. Must have cell reception. GSM, I believe, like T mobile. Do your research please for your situation. Besides catching a thief, I've seen Fox, Coyote and other interesting critters. I like that it has almost 180 sweep and up/down. Solar.

Even if the sun is not there you can detach the solar cell charge it and put it back. Easy to charge. The app recommends the power consumption for various settings. I like the option of continious light or infra red. The cam gives option of saving on cloud or sd card. The wire from the cam to cell is long enought if the direction of solar cell needs to be different that cam. One of the other ways I used it was to use it by placing it any where temporary as it has its own power supply you can place it any where indoor or outdoor like camping. The app displays that battery charge level so if it goes down you can charge it manually. Multiple phones can watch the footage at the same time. I wish this could connect to google home or alexa.,"This is the second solar camera I bought. This is an excellent high-end security camera. The motion detection starts quickly, works much better than my Ring doorbell. I got the first camera to overlook my backyard, and because I like it very much, I got the second one for my driveway. I love being able to view my property without having to go outside. It helps me to keep track of what is going on. This is the ideal solution for me because where I placed it, this is an area where I can't run electric power. It has been great to run off solar power and don’t worry about electric installation. Living in NY, it hits direct sunlight for just a few hours each day, but that seems to be more than enough to power it completely. I am happy with the video quality and detection quality. It does a great job at night and even has lights, which is pretty cool—overall an excellent option for areas with no power.","I intall it in the far back on my 2 acres yard, everybody notice it and it looks very sophisticated so i think that is a huge deterrent for any intruder by itself. Additionally i find a feature that i didn't expect, it have white led lamp in addition to the night IR, so its a really good option for my back yard where i dont have any lights or electricity, o can easily turn it on with my phone and move it around. Image quality is good enough for surveillance and monitoring. Very happy.","I installed this solar powered security camera on my shed overlooking my backyard as I do not have a power source to plug a camera in. The solar panel provides all the energy to keep the camera up & operating without have to constantly take it down to recharge inside my house, like other outdoor units.this model was perfect to keep an eye on things while not at home.I had to replace my previous solar camera, it wasn’t giving me enough range .. I decided on this model Specifically because it was the best price I could find with The 360° coverage .The camera & solar panel install was very easy.. Despite the camera being a little heavy, the mount holds it it securely!!I have been using it now for over a month and I am very happy with it!I have the app installed & I am quite familiar with how to setup & use the features. I can honestly say the app is extremely user friendly. This camera uses wifi, so as long as you have a decent connection in range, you can remotely use this camera. There are a few functions within the app for setting up different notifications. The picture quality of of both night and day are extremely clear when viewed on my phone. Camera has excellent night vision!The design, the functionality, the quality, the app viewing & notifications are among the best that I have used in terms of affordable security cameras. A very well made product & I highly recommend trying it out.Worth the price!!",I have several solar powered cameras around my house since I can't easily get power everywhere. This is the first time that I have tried a PTZ one with pan and tilt. It was very easy to set up and get connected and the 1080P picture quality is great day or night. It has a floodlight mode where you can use it as a security light and get full color at night. The PIR motion detection isn't great but works as well as most. The only issue I had was finding a micro SD card that would keep working. I tried several that worked in other cameras but after a day I would get a no memory card found error.

It took several tries to pair it with the Wi-Fi but every device I have ever added like this requires several attempts to pair.

The technician directed me and sent me a sample password to use to login and from there he checked back with me several times to make sure that the set up was complete and I had no more questions. I do not know what time zone they are in but the customer service rep that I was chatting with was up with me until almost midnight. If you buy as many gadgets as I buy that need technical support I can tell you that the customer support is most definitely excellent.

You can move the camera around from the app which is really cool and if you put it in the right place you can cover a ton of area. The solar panel holds the batteries and there is room inside of 6 18650's which is probably a bit of overkill, it comes with 3 installed and room for 3 more, unless it's dark for days on end the 3 batteries should be plenty, but always good to have options. The motion detection is spot on and starts quickly, works much better than my Ring doorbell. Overall awesome high end security camera.",Amazing 👏 technology advanced security camera..Swivel using app is incredible coupled with Zoom feature is outstanding...than on top of that the Solar charging as you can see in my picture is by far one of the best features....Totally wireless and with the WiFi feature...Pictures are only in SD that I took but it has the HD feature by simply tapping in app...Alert settings are amazing as seen in my pics. Without question a bargain for the money! Easy install and connection!,"Cameras work as advertised (I have 2). I ordered extra batteries (18650) from Amazon (separately) and added them in to the cameras. As with all cameras, finding a good mounting position is the hardest part. This one needs to have a good wi-fi signal, which means you will likely have to add an outdoor wi-fi extender or outdoor wired LAN antenna, or indoor wi-fi extenders on inside walls closest to outside camera location. I ordered wifi-extenders (TP-Link AC750 WiFi Extender RE230) separately also on AMZN, and setup up the extenders and cameras inside, prior to installing cameras outside. Had to move extenders to various locations inside the house to get best connection to camera and to base wi-fi. SOLIOM+ App seems to work pretty good, and camera stays connected to wi-fi. All wi-fi problems so far have been with my signal & extenders, not the camera as far as I can tell. My camera (and solar panel) are in shade under trees, and we have had several dark stormy days, but after several weeks I have had no battery charging issues, and cameras have stayed online all the time, day and night. I also added memory cards (SD) to each camera before installation. I record all video to SD.I tried to activate the free (7-day?) Trial Cloud video storage via the SOLIOM+ app on my phone, but it just didn't work. I wanted to test that Cloud storage before sending any money for a paid account, but that's on hold until I can try to get the free Trial to work. Camera video quality is great, day and night -- I use the night vision mode by turning off the cameras light and use IR. Pan/Tilt works good, but you should know that is is in 'fixed increments' when you hit the app p/t buttons. There is no optical zoom, but you can 'zoom' in the app with normal phone 2-finger touchscreen operation. Also, there is no way to view video through any other means other than their SOLIOM+ app on the phone. A firmware upgrade would be greatly appreciated that allows standard network access from camera to software like Blue Iris. Most camera makers seem to have proprietary software or apps so this maker is not unusual. 1 drawback is (at maximum movement sensitivity) camera misses some activity (cars and people in driveway). There is also a 'glitch' (I would call it), where motion is activated just fine, but recording stops at your preset time limit, even though motion continues. There will be no added video either on the original clip or on additional clips. All additional motion is just not recorded. On the other camera which is viewing only yard, (versus driveway, cars, people), motion is activated for leaves falling and bugs flying by. None but the most expensive (several times $cost of this one) have great motion control so this isn't a complaint given the price of these cameras, just be aware of some of the limitations of less expensive cameras like this one. So far this camera has operated in weather from 80's down to upper 20's (F) and in lots of rain without any problem. 1 big problem is that when recording to SD card, you can only *view* the saved video on your phone (in the SOLIOM+ app), but you cannot download the video and save it to your phone or anywhere else -- you have to open the camera, take out the SD card, then copy the video clips that way - which is pretty ridiculous. That is probably the only reason NOT to get this camera. I assume, but have not tested it, that video on their cloud service would be downloadable to a PC or something. There are video capture apps for android that may help to capture the video while you play it on your phone, but I have also not tried any of that. SOLIOM+ app should be updated ASAP to allow downloading video from SD to phone storage.","We love the pan, tilt, zoom option and the video quality is great. The setup is extremely easy. You can add 3 extra 18650 batteries for backup power but it's not really needed. You can store/review the files on your micro SD card or the cloud. If you want to use the cloud, they have 3 different price plans as shown in the pics. So far so good, really happy with this purchase.",,3423,1,https://www.amazon.com/SOLIOM-S600-Outdoor-Security-PTZ-IP-Camera-Activated-Spotlight/dp/B083TX4J2D/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=solar+powered+wireless+security+camera&qid=1640229363&sr=8-15

This was my first piece of equipment that came with a solar panel so I was a bit intimidated but it was much easier to setup then expected.The quality of the camera is excellent, both day and night vision. I have other cameras that use the CloudEdge app so setup was quick and painless. The mounting screws were a bit too long to get into the beam easily so I used shorter ones so I didn't have to wait for help with a drill and was able to install it by myself and I'm confident it's not going anywhere.The only downside to this camera is the inability to view or operate it outside of the CloudEdge app. This is not an issue for me though as I use an SD card so if I need to save the footage I can do so by recording through the app. Cloud storage is available also. The app does everything I need it to, I figured out that the camera will pan by touching the live feed as well which is awesome.Overall I'm extremely satisfied with this camera, it's much more than I expected for the price range.",Before I know there were actually sun powered camera exist on the market . I have giant old school camera installation by my land lord . God know how old is that camera. And my wife and I recently experienced miss letters from th USPS . Most important there are EDD unemployment checks . After we contact USPS So we though that might be some people took it after Carrie drop offI first tried the dashcam on the rear windshield. But the problem is that we can't keep the power on without turn the car on . And I second try was put a portable power bank hook up with my dash cam. And it works but only for a few hoursThen I did research and decide to give a try on the solar system camera . Obviously it fits my needs . I put camera next to rear window . And solar panel at front .the cable are perfectly enough for my car . I turned on the motion detective mode . It kinda blow my mind . Totally new thing to me . It will record everything if there is motion and send your a message if you decide to open the permission push to you. We turned on so Everytime carrier drop off and I will receive motion message ony phone .Camera has standard and HD to tier . I highly recommend use the HD . IT make the motion detective more effective. One more good thing I like a lot is the night vision . It will record even the whole dark situation .Breif :meet ally needs No drill no screw no mount needed. . and even if I moved later and just packed up and as long as has sunlight it will do the job . . Very satisfied . All senario . Oh even batter waterproof .

Easy to set up. Easy to modify the settings via the app. The microphone is exceptional, I can hear things on the app like if I were standing where the camera was mounted.. The 1080p is crystal clear! Solar panel option and the fact it's on a data plan makes it super versatile! I bought an additional 2 since!",Got a Mint Mobile SIM for this cam. Setup was a breeze. Had to reboot the cam twice to get the SIM to activate (not a big deal). Battery is 75%+ every morning and is fully charged on solar every evening. Image quality is great. Android & iPad apps are excellent and easy to use. Motion sensing is slightly lacking as it is a PIR sensor and not image motion recognition. Camera only records motion events triggered by the PIR sensor so if you need constant recording you will need wired cameras and an NVR. Overall I'm very satisfied!,"I bought this camera to monitor a remote renovation project and it works great. No power needed, no wifi required. It works on the rechargable battery & solar panel. At first I bought two tmobile sim cards from a seller on Amazon, but the sim cards would not work and the camera kept saying Sim card Not Recognized. I went to two different Tmobile stores and called customer service (45-minute call) and no one was able to help. I did not want to give up on the camera and I instead decided Tmobile was not the right route for me. I went to Target and picked up a FreedomPop Sim Card $9.99 - Free Basic Plan & GSM SIM Kit and it works great! The set up, from the time of using the FreedomPop was very fast, simple and easy and I am grateful at the quality and ease of the camera. I purchased two of them and would definitely recommend.","Update:changed my rating to 5 stars. The limited sim card options and reception problems are the cell companies issues not the camera manufacturer. The camera works reliably. Just took two days to set it up finding a pre-paid data provider.Also you are able to use an external battery pack to charge your camera.Nick of time! Most importantly be patient, the setup of the sim card is not a breeze it will take time and try your patience. T-mobile prepaid data sim cards are nearly non-existent as they are moving to a different platform. AT&T pre-paid works. What I recommend as steps to follow for setup. 1. Receive your camera/charge the battery right away. 2. Take your camera to the cellular store you plan on using for data. Set it up with the clerk and test it right there before you leave. Now the hard part is done, be sure your carrier is a GSM and supports WCDMA and FDD LTE. DO NOT EXPECT to receive your Amazon box and use the camera right away. I came to use this camera because I was looking for something multifunctional and reliable and I got that. Our old wifi camera died and cellular gives you a lot more flexibility. I was impressed with the solar panel and construction of the camera. I received the camera Tuesday night, set it up Wednesday night, caught the foal being born Thursday morning. Also audio is good and decent battery length. You should have a micro SD card to install right away. Overall a great camera, I'd give it five stars if it was easier to find a sim card that worked with it.",772,112,https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Solar-Powered-Security-Wirefree-Go/dp/B07TKKPTL3/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=solar+powered+wireless+security+camera&qid=1640229363&sr=8-16

The camera came very well packaged, with easy to understand, detailed instructions.The startup and installation was very simple.The camera is completely wireless, which means in order to operate it you are required to download the cloudedge app, which is how the camera is controlled. I would prefer the camera to also be functional offline or without an app, but the cloudedge app works great - it has detailed settings for camera sensitivity, video resolution, 2 way audio, direction control, video playback, etc.This is the first security camera I have owned, so I was surprised to see how good the video quality and audio quality actually was.

I then set it up outside using the provided solar panel to maintain battery charge. Again, with the app, I was able to set the camera to motion detection. The app alerted my phone and allowed me to watch the video segments. This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it!","I am so impress with this camera that I will buy another one for the back of my house. What I like the most is that I will get an alert INSTANTLY via cell phone when it detects a human motion. I also get the alerts on my apple watch.

This will be especially helpful when I have to travel.The picture clarity is very clear and can I zoom in and move the lens around to see other directions and again I don’t need to be at home to do this.With the solar board, I’m going to be able to install the camera above my fence outside my property with out needing an electrical outlet .The instructions and CloudEdge app was very easy and simple to follow to get the camera started .

Awesome battery life!,Feature-rich Security Camera System,True Wireless camera,Security cameras have come a long way!,Great Wireless Security Solar Powered Camera,"I'd like to break this review down into 2 parts. One for the product and one for the customer service.Product:This camera has great quality. I've posted some pictures of the camera quality here and I have the camera mounted on my front gate facing the dirt road. In the distance there are mountain views which other camera I've tested had poor quality.Now with the camera mounted about 15ft high it doesn't do a great job with reading license plates but that's to be expected. Don't let it deter you from buying one of these because this has a few features that are really helpful.Before putting this up I had major issues with people on quads riding down the dirt trails and blowing dust everyone which would be all over my vehicles. I live in Arizona so this is to be expected but this is a private road and people should not be speeding down the road on quads.Well I installed this camera as well as a security camera sign(see pictures) and the quad traffic has drastically dropped! Just installing this has made a HUGE difference! I believe the really bright LED lights the come on when an object passes is the biggest reason quad traffic has slowed down. Its clearly known at night now that quadders are being watched!Having the really bright LED lights is just a HUGE plus I can't get over how much this has helped because it makes itself known much better than just a flashing light which this camera does have.The LED light and flashing light can be turned on or off at anytime through the app as well. Meaning of you don't want the lights on because maybe you'd prefer to hide your camera you can completely shut these features off.App:Okay so I have tried a Solium solar panel in the past and the difference between the app is night and day vs the Solium camera.I'd say something that the other camera didn't have which was important to me was the ability to download videos from the app straight to the phone WITHOUT having to pay for cloud service. This is so handy for putting these video files on to your computer to either touchup the lighting or email it to law enforcement or friends/family.The app is very clean and works great. I have not had lagging or bugs with the CTRONICS app as I have with other camera apps.One downfall however is the fact that there is NO ONVIF support or a web portal. This is helpful to me because it would allow me to use TinyCam Pro on phone to see this camera along with my other cameras all in one place. On the flip side though, I am able to see all my ctronic cameras in this one app.I have a portable battery powered ctronics camera that unfortunately has its own app called Cloud Edge that I don't like. Thankfully this camera uses the same CTRONICS app that most of their cameras use.As much as I would love to have ONVIF support I do understand why it's not available. Since this camera goes into sleep mode when there's no motion having a remote connection wouldn't work. Otherwise the camera would be on 24/7.Night Vision:I have not been able to do many tests with night vision because I prefer the LED lights to turn on with motion. With the LED lights I can see in color at night. As soon as you connect to the camera the LED lights come on as well. However playing around a little with the night vision seems to work really well at 15ft high. I have no complaints.Microphone and Speaker:This is another huge plus! The microphone quality is just as good as any other camera I've used in the past but what really amazes me is the speaker on this thing. Using the CTRONICS app I spoke through the app to use the speaker on the camera and WOW! The speaker on this camera is WAY louder than any of the cameras I have INCLUDING other CTRONICS cameras I own. This is awesome because the camera is 15ft high and anyone would be able to clearly hear me speaking through the camera! Major plus for me!Battery Life:I've had this camera up for about 2 weeks now and I can't really so much about how long the battery will last but I can tell you I have a lot of traffic in front of my gate. From cars to quads this camera is constantly waking up and recording. Even at night the battery doesn't drop much at all and the next day the solar panel charges the battery back to full.Surprisingly the battery lasts much longer than the old Solium solar camera I had on the pole before which had 6 batteries.Guys and gals, this camera is well worth the money! It was so easy to setup with the CTRONICS app and I have nothing bad to say about this camera. Buy, buy, and buy more! They are well worth it! I currently have 4 CTRONICS cameras and they have ALL been great.Customer Service:CTRONICS has been awesome! From the very first camera I bought I've kept buying more of these. At one point I recieved a scratch card inside the second box and won a free sd card. I decided I'd email CTRONICS and see if they really would send me one for free. Well I never got the SD card BUT instead they sent me a battery powered camera which I currently have setup now.They have been so helpful with every question I've had that they have become my go to camera. Not only are the products well built but the customer service is amazing!Let me tell you if you have ANY issues with a product you bought from CTRONICS I GUARANTEE they will get you a replacement or help you get setup EVERYTIME. I'm telling you the customer service is just absolutely amazing.Thanks,MikeEdit: 5/6/2021 This camera has still been working amazing on the gate. Even with Arizona's harsh heat it's still holding up amazing. It's been so useful and has helped with a missing FedEx package. I'd also like to say thank you so much for those that have marked this review as helpful!","This camera is very easy to install. Assembly and mounting is intuitive. The camera is a complete system with batteries, solar charging panel, memory card slot...everything. No cables are needed as it connects wirelessly to your phone or tablet. I have installed this on a portable mount next to my motorhome to observe my entry door, my car, and the surrounding area. The motion detection will sound an alarm on the connected phone. The camera works flawlessly at night as well as in the daytime. The camera automatically selects BW at night but you can set it for color at night with a slight degradation in picture quality. This is a quality device. I will probably buy several more as the app will permit multiple cameras to be installed.","I have many “wireless” IP cameras, but up to now they still required power. While power is certainly easier to run than an ethernet cable, there are locations where it is still impossible or certainly unsightly. One of those locations is a fence on my property. It is an ideal location for a camera in that is can view the outside rear of my house, but due to the length of the fence, it is near impossible to run power to it. With the pan and tilt feature, I can remotely move the camera to view the yard as well if needed.Since I have other Ctronics cameras that have performed well, I decided to give this one a try. It is a well built and hefty unit. I charged the batteries with a conventional USB 2-amp charger before installation. This initial charge took almost a whole day, while the camera was on at the same time. I also installed a 16 GB SD which I formatted in the camera.The Ctronics software was easy to install on my android phone and setup was easy using the Wi-Fi option. Alerts are easy to set up as wellFinally, the picture quality, especially on the HD setting, is very good. It remains clear and detail rich even at night. It is also very cool to turn on the bright white light at night should you get an alert. That alone will scare off any intruders.","Another camera added to my security protocol.I've had PTZ security cameras before, and I've had solar powered cameras before, but this is my first camera that combines both.Assembly was easy.Setup took about 30 minutes.I had one error (wasn't reading instructions) on changing the default password.Camera housing feels sturdy and well built, and the solar panel appears well made. The connection from the panel to the housing is micro usb and I'm pretty sure the unit can be powered over usb if required.I'd recommend leaving it to charge in the sun awhile before first use, so the battery has full charge.The app was easy to find and install.There's a whole host of settings that can all be controlled from the app.Camera can be turned on/off from the app.The SD card can be formatted from the app.Camera positioning is moved by swiping your finger on screen. Took me a few minutes to navigate positioning but operation was smooth.Overall, I'm feeling good about this purchase. Really feeling good about the app and functions offered. Hoping to get the FTP settings going so I can record to a local home hard drive.","I recently purchased 2 wired security cameras under the same brand. This solar powered camera is a great addition to the mix, giving me the option of putting a camera were running wires isn't a good option. The video is very good, and as long as you are running the software on your phone, you get alerts when the camera picks up movement. Using the Ctronics software on your phone or tablet, you are able to see full color with timestamped video remotely. This software also works with their other products as well, as in my case, you can see multiple screens at the same time. This camera allows you to pan-tilt and using your phone's zoom feature, makes it a PTZ. The only cons that I found with this unit - you cannot connect to the camera using your computer, unlike their wired security camera ( Outdoor Security Camera with Color Night Vision, Ctronics 1080P PTZ Camera WiFi IP Camera Home Security Camera with 355°Pan 90°Tilt Auto Tracking Human Detection Two-Way Audio). Also, this solar camera does not track targets like the wired version - but I am sure that this is due to having to conserve power since it relies on a battery being charged by the sun. The picture I took using the camera is roughly 30 feet away from the house, so you can see it shows a great deal of detail in a wide angle lens. The camera is also able to use two-way communication - as it has a speaker and microphone should you choose to use it. This camera will be a great addition to compliment the cameras I already have in use.",3062,1,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Wireless-Ctronics-Rechargeable-Detection/dp/B08N63JXP7/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=solar+security+camera&qid=1640229392&sr=8-16

I’ve not seen another camera yet to offer PTZ and be truly wireless with the solar camera. I had a few doubts but the quality of the camera for the price amazed me Its well-built and the software is setup so installation is easy. It has very good video quality and the solar panel so far is good to keep the camera charged. Some features that other PTZ camera’s software may have might be missing but the software was built so the camera can run off just the solar panel so it won’t go dead on you when you need it the most. The installation instructions are simple and straight forward. They say you need WIFI but I set one up on my phones hotspot and it would connect easily every time I was close and I would have access to the videos that were stored on it. I was able to put one high up in a tree with a man lift and it worked as good as any professional camera. It’s absolutely worth the money they are selling it for and I really recommend get it.",The camera system is affordable and produces good pictures and video. I'm happy with the overall utility of the camera.,"App works well to control camera remotely and see different angles. Can view is SD or HD video modes. Night vision screen shot shown.

I even looked at trail cameras, used primarily for hunting. So glad I found these! They satisfy all my requirements and more. I have gone through the entire set-up process, the only thing I have yet to do is actually affix them to their permanent locations outside my house (two cameras total: one in front and one in back). Once I do that I will update my review if necessary, but for now, 5 stars!I've set everything up, both an app on my phone and a client on my laptop, all connected to the cameras, everything works. That alone is pretty cool, because I tend to have my shortcomings in dealing with technology. So far I'm really happy!These cameras-- were easy to set up-- run on batteries so no power outlet required (my older home doesn't have outlets outside)-- have solar capability so I don't have to worry about replacing batteries all the time-- have usb recharging capability in case the solar panels don't recharge enough for some reason-- offer a magnetic attachment to their bases so I can just grab them off if I have to charge them (they have a little tether cord to keep them from hitting the ground if something knocks them off base)-- allow remote battery level monitoring-- send alerts to my phone when they detect movement (e-mails, too, if I want)-- require no subscription fees-- require no ""cloud"" usage (unless I want it)-- allow live viewing, as well as recording video (via micro sd card), and taking still pictures (controlled from pc or phone)-- allow playback of captured videos and pictures on phone/pc, as well as downloading of individual clips/stills-- automatically rewrite over oldest data first when sd card gets full-- include two-way audio communication as well as a siren-- offer plenty of customization of various features-- are reasonably priced compared to many other systems I looked at-- have 1080p resolution, infrared for nighttime, 130-degree view angleSo these things are exactly what I was looking for! Now the only thing to find out is if when I place them outside they are able to connect to wifi adequately, and to see how well they withstand outside weather. I have had no problems with wifi while playing with them inside, but I have seen some complaints about limited range. Even if I have problems in this regard, I don't know if that can be blamed on this product, as it could very well be my own personal wifi set up and limitations. I'm willing to get an extender or whatever to enhance my wifi signal if necessary - we'll see what happens. As for outside durability, they look pretty well sealed up, and they also come with these little rubber jackets to pull over them upon final placement. So again, we'll see how it goes. I'm in Florida and will get my share of inclement weather and high temperatures. I no longer have large trees around my house, so solar charging shouldn't be an issue, but days with no respite from the hot, blazing sun could be a formidable challenge.Update: I have my front camera installed in the front. I found that finding a suitable location was more challenging than I thought it would be, mostly because of the need to screw the camera and solar panel holders into something. My house is mostly stucco, which in my experience has proven to be less than ideal for screws. I have a few wooden pieces near the roof (I don't know house construction terminology), but they are vertical, which means I couldn't use the magnetic ball-joint holder, which was disappointing because that thing is so cool. Unfortunately it doesn't provide a broad adjustment angle and if affixed to a vertical surface it can't be angled up high enough for a good view; it really needs a horizontal surface and I don't really have any outside except the roof itself. But fortunately it comes with the other type of holder, and I actually ended up using the strap around a gutter spout, which means I can easily move it if I want, and I didn't have to drill any holes into my house. I wish the solar panel came with the strap as well. But I just screwed its bracket into the vertical wood piece mentioned earlier.All that said, it's been communicating with my wifi just fine, I've been getting alerts, the solar panel is keeping it charged, the picture is great both day and night and all is well. It even got heavily rained on in a gusty thunderstorm and held up without incident. I did notice, as I was walking around trying to find the place I wanted to put it, that different locations had different levels of wifi connection. Luckily, the place I wanted to put it also had a clear wifi signal. I can see how that could be frustrating, though, if the place you want to put it has a poor signal.Still 5 stars, really happy. So now I just need to put my other one up in the back, and hopefully I'll get a good look at who's been messing around in my catnip! :)","I have friends with various home security cameras that came highly recommended, but we are in a unique situation where “regular” hard wired/broadband internet is not an option. We have a Verizon MiFi hotspot that often exceeds the 24GB unlimited allowance about halfway through our cycle, and we do not have outlets on the exterior of our house, so our options are limited when it comes to home security cameras. Thank goodness for that, because we would have spent 10X more if we had purchased the cameras and cloud services our friends use. This camera was our only option given our rural circumstances and has proven to be the best home security camera available! The solar panel keeps the battery charged 90-100% so it can be placed anywhere within WiFi range, it works without failure even with crappy satellite/cellular WiFi (we have a Verizon MiFi hotspot that goes in and out of service every day), it can handle a micro SD card of 128GB that will last 10-12 months (and deletes the oldest recordings first when full) so we don’t have to pay a monthly fee for “cloud” storage, and the picture is clear as day on both live feed and Playback mode whether it is midnight, 7am, 2pm, etc. The infrared is amazing and we can see 200+ ft away in the dead of night. We plan to purchase 3 more of these cameras to monitor every angle of our property because they are the most affordable and cannot be beat when compared to clarity and functionality of their competitors. Setup is easy, just be sure to point the QR code in step 3 from your phone to the camera when the app prompts you to “verify” the code. I spent a few hours trying to figure that step out because it isn’t clear in the instruction manual, and almost gave up and returned the camera. Sooooo glad a google search helped me out with that step because this is literally the best camera ever!!!",,"I absolutely love the Reolink security camera system. I spent nearly two months researching. The Reolink sold me after watching a youtube video from Lifehackers who compared, Reolink, Arlo and Blink.Why Reolink? in my research it WON.It came in a 5 pack, it had all the pieces (accessories) needed to assemble all outside or all inside or a combination of both 5 strong magnets mounts for inside or outside (wall or table), 5 straps to attach to a gutter, 5 mounts for wall attachment, 5 rechargeable batteries, 5 skins to protect in outside elements, 5 mini solar panels to attach so you don't have to recharge batteries. The directions were easy to read, the wifi was easy to connect. The only ""thing"" I had to buy were mini sd cards (that would be a nice option to include in future boxes). I purchase the cards for the exterior cameras not the interior. *sd cards only necessary if you want to keep a running record of activity. My indoor cameras didn't need them, but I could insert and turn on or off as I wish.The installation was a breeze taking less that 5 mins per camera and the hard to reach angles you can swap the image vertically or mirror it, if needed (like attaching to a ceiling). The cell phone view allows you to view 1 image, 4 images or 9 images (cameras) at a time. If the camera has the sd card in it you can record, under motion or spontaneously. You can talk to the person you are viewing they can talk back. You can see at day or night, and there is even an alarm to sound at your will.This system allows you to check in on your fur babies and talk to them or drop in and record their actions. You could share with someone a video or a still image using a text, cell fb, IG, etc... Cell notifications are within 5 seconds of activity and the view span is about 180. The first activity I got scared me, in the middle of the morning while I was at work I got a notification there was activity, when I viewed the recording, it was the garbage man, and the distance to record him was about 30ft. Impressive.Lets talk about the comparisons.Arlo had everything except the necessary installation pieces, it looked nice you were able to view, talk 2 way but there packaging was limited for example, if I purchased the 5 pack, it comes with 2 outside mounts and 3 indoor, meaning that I would need to buy accessories just to complete the job.Blink had everything Alro had with the same problem and add one more, if I wanted to save a video recorded, I would have to purchase cloud space.In the end, Reolink had everything I needed for the right price. No monthly subscriptions, no future batteries to buy, no icloud to buy, just set it up, connect to wifi and done.Thank You Reolink...",,4762,820,https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Rechargeable-Argus-Solar-Panel/dp/B07GBRV8W5/ref=sr_1_22_sspa?keywords=solar+security+camera&qid=1640229392&sr=8-22-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFYV0dRRDNVS1g5R0gmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAwMTI5MjczVjdSQktDTjVLWE1FJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyNTk4MTBHT0k0MDcyUVFTWTImd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9idGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl

Buyer Should Have Serious Doubts About Buying From Reolink,This is impressive (bought a second),The best camera we've bought so far and we have several different brands !,Quality camera!,A nice Solar PT cam with excellent push alerts,"Leaving five stars because most people only look at the great reviews...so here is a more rounded review that should give everyone pause before they buy.Let me start by saying that I love the cameras. Bought 4 here and 3 more directly from Reolink on their Ebay store. The cameras have great picture quality and if you follow the instructions for setup using the bar codes, it takes about 45 seconds to get them up and running.And I am returning all of them. Further, I would strongly encourage all prospective buyers to strongly consider looking elsewhere for their security camera needs. Reolink is simply INEPT when it comes to backing up their products.A couple of weeks ago I bought 4 of these cameras. At $150 a camera with the solar panel, they are not cheap. As instructed during the setup of one of them, I went to lift up the little 1/2 inch by 3/8 rubber flap that covers the on/off switch and secures it from rain. The flap is held to the camera with a paper clip thick protrusion that goes into the body of the camera. When I pulled at it, that extremely thin piece of rubber holding the flap to the camera, broke. I didn't pull it hard, and I do not have super human strength. It just sort of broke and although I can still place the flap into the camera, it needs to be repaired because if it ever falls off, the entire camera will be ruined.I didn't think this was a big deal.I was wrong.I wrote to the company and explained the situation. I explained that the cover tore and I wanted to know how I could get a replacement cover. I would be happy to cover the costs. No problem. And I made it clear that I only needed the little cover because the camera otherwise worked fine. I just need the cover!Their response was that they wanted me to send them a picture of the camera. Admittedly, I was irritated. So I wrote back that I was surprised that they wanted a picture of this because the camera worked....I just needed the small cover and that I could probably buy it on ebay for a few cents plus shipping. This thing seemed like a no-brainer to me.They wrote back and said...oh, now that we understand that the camera works they will refer it to their techs.Great.Next day (and keep in mind that their turnaround is always a day later) I get an email asking me to send them a copy of the invoice. No problem. I did that within a minute.Next day..we enter the Twilight Zone. Instead of simply writing back to me with something saying that they are shipping out the new cover, I get an email asking me to send them the link of the Ebay listing for the cover I found so that they can tell me if it will fit the camera. HUH? So they have gone from taking responsibility for making a cheaply connected cover to helping me ensure that a third party solution (that did not exist) would fit their camera? This was sort of nutso.I wrote back and said simply that I did not find a cover on ebay.This morning - another 24 hours later - comes the latest response...they want to give me a 5 dollar refund.Now you would expect that a company selling a 150 dollar camera with a rubber cover for the on/off switch would grasp that the cover that they designed for their own camera to protect the switch from rain/snow/etc had an actual purpose for existing...but these folks instead want to refund me five bucks to accomplish what exactly? Am I supposed to tape the five dollar bill over the switch to protect it? I just need a new tiny cover!So I am now a week into this silliness and I have had enough. These cameras are not cheap. So before you buy from these folks, think very seriously about the warranty and support that they give and ask yourself if you should be going for products made by Google or Netgear because there is no doubt that a similar situation with their products would have resulted in a replacement part coming in roughly 2 days.Reolink makes great cameras. But they simply have no ability to back up their products with support that should make people comfortable. I have lost confidence in this company.All of my cameras...a thousand dollars of cameras...are going back because they can't figure out how to send out a tiny rubber cover that cost them a few cents.Pathetic.","My camera just showed up today. Ive been messing with it all day. I hooked up the solar panel and even on a cloudy day in the shade, it still charged a bit. Picture quality is clean 1080. Functionality is very responsive. Night vision is strong and clear. I can also listen with the built in mic and even that is crystal clear. I am very happy with this camera so far. Battery life seems to be pretty great. Its battery only loses about 10% over night and stays at 100% every day it. Very impressive and easy to install. I think i will add more in the future. Motion detection works great. Was a bit sensitive at first, but after tinkering with the settings in the app, i got it to ignore traffic and sense people. Highly recommended.","This is Karen's husband writing this review as I am the ""tech guy"" in our home.I am VERY pleased with how the camera is performing so far, so the 4.2 out of 5 rating seems well deserved. I admit I had some reservations when I read some of the reviews that were negative, in my opinion some may have been because of an individually defective product and some may have been due to lack of detailed enough directions.When I was first trying to connect the camera to our WIFI it wouldn't connect, then I realized I forgot to type in our WIFI password, DUH ! After I added the password it connected immediately. The camera is roughly about 85 feet from our WIFI router and goes thru 2 walls and still has kept connected very well.Also, we have Amazon Alexa and at first could not get Alexa to recognize the camera, so I did an online search for help and found a page on the Reolink support site with the steps needed to connect to Alexa, after reading that page I saw there was a step I didn't know about, once I followed those steps Alexa connected very well ! We can view the live camera feed from our smartphone app, from our ""Echo Shows"" via voice command, and even on our tv screens with Amazon Firestick (we have other brands of security cameras we view thru the Firestick also) so I can use a voice command and see different cameras on the screens including the Reolink camera, and I did not have to download anything to the Firestick, simply enable Alexa according to the directions on the help page I mentioned.I already had security cameras looking from our home outward, I wanted a wireless solar PTZ camera I could mount away from the house that I could turn to look at the house as well as turn to view other areas of our property not covered by the cameras we already had.So I mounted the camera on a thick (schedule 40) PVC pipe and mounted the solar panel on the very top of the pole, I used 3 hose clamps to fasten the PVC pipe to a 4 foot metal fence post I hammered into the ground, so far it seems to working very well. I will upload a picture of it.I do a lot of research before buying tech stuff, and it would be difficult to find ANY product that is perfect or that you might wish had more or better features, but for the features you get with this camera (including solar powered, PTZ capability, Alexa connectivity) I really can't complain for the price paid.Note: Remember this is not a commercial grade professional system, but commercial grade features likely cost much higher commercial grade prices, so again, for the price paid I really can't complain, I feel this camera does really pretty good for it's price level !","I placed this camera in my front yard on a tree, I however had to buy a longer WiFi antenna because it was lagging a lot . But the antenna really helped once I replaced the factory one. It is a good quality product thou. Keep it close to your house and your ok with the factory antenna. I would purchase again !","Its been holding up outside in winter weather down to freezing temps. decent quality video and excellent alerts on the cheap, Solar panel works greattoo but needs at least a couple hours of decent sunlight to charge well.",4290,549,https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Argus-PT-Solar-Panel/dp/B07W6PXRR8/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=solar+security+camera&qid=1640229392&sr=8-13

You can move the camera around from the app which is really cool and if you put it in the right place you can cover a ton of area. The solar panel holds the batteries and there is room inside of 6 18650's which is probably a bit of overkill, it comes with 3 installed and room for 3 more, unless it's dark for days on end the 3 batteries should be plenty, but always good to have options. The motion detection is spot on and starts quickly, works much better than my Ring doorbell. Overall awesome high end security camera.",Amazing 👏 technology advanced security camera..Swivel using app is incredible coupled with Zoom feature is outstanding...than on top of that the Solar charging as you can see in my picture is by far one of the best features....Totally wireless and with the WiFi feature...Pictures are only in SD that I took but it has the HD feature by simply tapping in app...Alert settings are amazing as seen in my pics. Without question a bargain for the money! Easy install and connection!,"Cameras work as advertised (I have 2). I ordered extra batteries (18650) from Amazon (separately) and added them in to the cameras. As with all cameras, finding a good mounting position is the hardest part. This one needs to have a good wi-fi signal, which means you will likely have to add an outdoor wi-fi extender or outdoor wired LAN antenna, or indoor wi-fi extenders on inside walls closest to outside camera location. I ordered wifi-extenders (TP-Link AC750 WiFi Extender RE230) separately also on AMZN, and setup up the extenders and cameras inside, prior to installing cameras outside. Had to move extenders to various locations inside the house to get best connection to camera and to base wi-fi. SOLIOM+ App seems to work pretty good, and camera stays connected to wi-fi. All wi-fi problems so far have been with my signal & extenders, not the camera as far as I can tell. My camera (and solar panel) are in shade under trees, and we have had several dark stormy days, but after several weeks I have had no battery charging issues, and cameras have stayed online all the time, day and night. I also added memory cards (SD) to each camera before installation. I record all video to SD.I tried to activate the free (7-day?) Trial Cloud video storage via the SOLIOM+ app on my phone, but it just didn't work. I wanted to test that Cloud storage before sending any money for a paid account, but that's on hold until I can try to get the free Trial to work. Camera video quality is great, day and night -- I use the night vision mode by turning off the cameras light and use IR. Pan/Tilt works good, but you should know that is is in 'fixed increments' when you hit the app p/t buttons. There is no optical zoom, but you can 'zoom' in the app with normal phone 2-finger touchscreen operation. Also, there is no way to view video through any other means other than their SOLIOM+ app on the phone. A firmware upgrade would be greatly appreciated that allows standard network access from camera to software like Blue Iris. Most camera makers seem to have proprietary software or apps so this maker is not unusual. 1 drawback is (at maximum movement sensitivity) camera misses some activity (cars and people in driveway). There is also a 'glitch' (I would call it), where motion is activated just fine, but recording stops at your preset time limit, even though motion continues. There will be no added video either on the original clip or on additional clips. All additional motion is just not recorded. On the other camera which is viewing only yard, (versus driveway, cars, people), motion is activated for leaves falling and bugs flying by. None but the most expensive (several times $cost of this one) have great motion control so this isn't a complaint given the price of these cameras, just be aware of some of the limitations of less expensive cameras like this one. So far this camera has operated in weather from 80's down to upper 20's (F) and in lots of rain without any problem. 1 big problem is that when recording to SD card, you can only *view* the saved video on your phone (in the SOLIOM+ app), but you cannot download the video and save it to your phone or anywhere else -- you have to open the camera, take out the SD card, then copy the video clips that way - which is pretty ridiculous. That is probably the only reason NOT to get this camera. I assume, but have not tested it, that video on their cloud service would be downloadable to a PC or something. There are video capture apps for android that may help to capture the video while you play it on your phone, but I have also not tried any of that. SOLIOM+ app should be updated ASAP to allow downloading video from SD to phone storage.","We love the pan, tilt, zoom option and the video quality is great. The setup is extremely easy. You can add 3 extra 18650 batteries for backup power but it's not really needed. You can store/review the files on your micro SD card or the cloud. If you want to use the cloud, they have 3 different price plans as shown in the pics. So far so good, really happy with this purchase.",,3423,1,https://www.amazon.com/SOLIOM-S600-Outdoor-Security-PTZ-IP-Camera-Activated-Spotlight/dp/B083TX4J2D/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=solar+security+camera&qid=1640229392&sr=8-10

Given the insufficient sunlight, my previous installed camera always run out of power. Thanks to the large solar battery panel, power outrage is no longer a problem, even when the camera was set on a high-power consumption mode. Furthermore, the camera comes with a long micro-USB cable, which makes it possible to connect the camera to an electrical and do 24h continuous recording mode.The installation is straightforward. One of the reasons is that unlike most cameras which only provide a fixed angle, this camera is more flexible to obtain a 360-degree view. So not too much adjustment is needed when installing.The app is easy to use. The camera provides a crispy view, even at night or in stormy weather. It is also possible to record colorful picture at night. The motion/humanoid detection is sensitive. The intercom works great, through which I can speak to the deliverers when I am at work.Cons: While the WiFi signaling could be a limitation, this product does work well with a WiFi extender. In contrast, my previous camera does not.","It helps a lot that it does not require wires. There is not much place for me to plug the camera in if it needs to be plugged in. So the being wireless and solar powered saved me from having to find a place to plug in, from constantly having to buy batteries and, from the hassle from dealing with the wires. Not only that, the recording shows up very clearly on my phone and it is very sensitive to human motion. So I know when someone comes close to my door and i can clearly see who it is. I am also able to speak to the person through the camera. It is very convenient if I am on vacation or at work.","I purchased one of these cameras to keep an eye on my off the grid cabin. I was pleasantly surprised with it. The unit was very easy to install. The picture quality is excellent and the app is easy to use. . The night vison is very strong and clear. I have been impressed with the battery life and have yet to run it down. I like the camera so much I purchased two more for my property. I have them set up outside approximately 200' from the cabin and they work great.The best part about these cameras is their customer service. I had a question about a feature on the app. I received a quick response from their rep and a solution to follow.If you are looking for an affordable, easy to use, wireless CCTV solution these cameras are for you.","You'll want a drill for the holes. I started mine with hammer and nail, then drilled. They provide a paper for drilling the holes, which made it easy. You'll need to charge the solar plate for 3 to 5 hours inside, before installing. Also, important, if you use the micro SD card, insert it first. When pairing the camera to your internet, be about 1 1/2 feet from router. The camera ""speaks,"" and is kind of loud. The trickiest part of installing were the bottom holes. I found that doing the right side first, then let camera rotate and hang down for the 2nd bottom screw made it easier, then do top screws. *** The picture quality is very good, day or night. (I can see the bugs flying at night!) Initially, it took several minutes to get it to connect, but once it connects a few times, it goes quite quickly. Camera rotation works great. Whether at home or away, it works great.","I installed this solar camera in front of the garage door. It can monitor the front of my garage door, the front door, and the grass without blind spots. When someone approaches my door. It will also sound an alarm. Makes me feel a lot safer. It is a colorful picture during the day. At night it is a black and white picture. And this solar energy does not need to install wires. Just install it in a sunny place. Don't worry about installation.

It does everything as advertised and more, night vision without the spotlights on is so clear and I have no trouble using either of the apps. The wide view of the camera is also great, it’s a big upgrade from our old security cameras, we didn’t even have to run wires we just used our old ones. One piece of advice if your using a gmail email account for this is to disable 2 step verification and allow untrusted applications because it will block it and your test email will fail! It also works with Dropbox, one thing I can’t figure out is how to get it to work with my google home mini.","The camera system is great. The video quality is crystal clear during the day and at night with night vision. The app works great on the phone, it just needs few improvements. Only thing we couldn't figure out is the audio from the cameras. Please, if you know how to make the audio to work. I will appreciate your help. Thanks","Great system. Even greater customer service. I like the APP. Have had them installed for about 4 months now. Advice: get more channels than you think you need. You will probably find an angle you were not thinking of and it's good to have the option of adding cameras. Also: the cameras work out to be something like $25 each if you buy them in the kit, but $50 if you buy separately. I had to buy 2 more for my 8 channel system that came with four cameras. I Wish I would have bought the 8 channel package with 8 cameras because I ended up buying two anyway which cost me $100, and I would have had two spare cameras as well.",879,72,https://www.amazon.com/Swann-Security-Surveillance-Weatherproof-SWDVK-845804WL/dp/B07VYVSTCW/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=swann+security+cameras&qid=1640230146&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzTE5YNFdRWUhHRDc4JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzY3MjE3MU8wNzJIU0FUN01KUCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjc2ODIyMUEwWVAwSDBQUVUwRSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

I see people commenting the video is not 4k. It is if you view it on your TV, the picture is super clear. The mobile app reduces the quality in what is transmitted to you to allow faster transmission. You can select medium or high quality. It is set on default at medium. If you click High quality, the video becomes good quality. What gets recorded on the harddrive is going to be in good 4k quality. The setup was easy, no problems at all. The app is good and responsive, loads instantly. Overall, very intuitive and easy install. The app is actually pretty good as well.","Basic installation, good for the price. My third system from this company and they only get better. Have replaced the others just as upgrades.","I previously had a Swann security system and four cameras that worked well, but they cameras were old (low resolution) video. My primary motivation for buying another Swann system was that I could re-use the existing cabling. Swann uses two cables per camera - a BNC/coax cable for the signal and a second power cable. That was extremely important. Drilling holes and running cable all around your house is about 95% of the work of installing one of these systems. Having the cabling in place was a huge time saver.Once I got the cameras all connected the video quality is just great (4K). The app for your phone (iPhone or Android) is a big improvement over the old app. Easy to to view live cameras or playback any video captured as a result of motion detection. The motion detection is great, you can block out custom areas in each camera that you don't want triggering the motion detection. You can also setup intrusion detection zones and privacy zones (mostly for indoor cameras). Also has a feature to upload video to a Dropbox account.Overall, I would highly recommend this system, especially if you're looking to upgrade your older Swann system.","Once the camera is installed, the pic is great, there should be a light on for night vision.

Being able to move the camera around is an awesome improvement too, keeps me from having to install multiple cameras. It was very easy to connect with their app and set everything up, maybe 10-15 minutes (mainly because after connecting it needs to download a firmware update.) Even installing it outside was super easy, four screws to your base and then put camera on it and tighten down with little screw tabs. If you are looking for a camera but not wanting a huge investment or complicated installation, this one is perfect for that! I highly recommend it!","- Design, build and paint quality is excellent- Since our side patio, yard & walk in area is very narrow and long, the camera can pan the whole side of the house. It also can pan straight down to alleviate any blind spots.- If someone comes to our side entry door we can pan to see who it is and use the speaker (two way speaker) to ask any questions before deciding whether we should open the door. Of course it's also great to see if Amazon or other vendor packages have been delivered. (Panning is done through the use of an icon on your mobile device)- Battery life is very good. In 3 weeks of use the battery is at 85%. (I intentionally left off the solar panel to make sure the battery was good.)- I did encounter one minor problem involving still images not being viewable after the camera detected motion and recorded video. The company was contacted via email and within 24 hours asked for more information. After giving them the info, they responded again within 24 hours with their explanation. (Nothing wrong with the camera … a software app update will be upcoming which should fix the issue.) After working in the computer support area all of my life, I am always impressed by companies which actually care about customers and respond quickly. Kudos to their support team!This is a very nice and functional security camera which I would purchase again.","This come with everything you need, except for the optional memory card. Charge it before you install, and with the solar panel set up to face the sun, you never have to worry about it running out of battery. No monthly subscription required which I love. You can add a microSD card to save footage. The pan and tilt functions work nicely from the app which allows you to expand your view. Motion detection works a little too well, so I would get alerts if strong winds move plants/tree shadows.

This is the one!,Can't Beat the Quality or Ease of Installation At This Price,Great home system - REALLY Easy Setup!!!,Still love it after 2 years of ownership,Really easy setup!,"If you have need of a security camera system this is the one. I spent hours researching and checking out different systems in person. Overall this system stood out significantly over others.Pros:- higher resolution. This is so extremely important. Higher the resolution means that you can see identifying information from further distances. Most systems stop at HD 1080 or 720. Reolink takes is another step past that.- PoE. Power over Ethernet allows extremely fast install as you only have one cable to run for the signal back to the recorder AND power. It also means that any holes you need to cut in your walls are much smaller.- The quality of the Ethernet cable is very nice, very flexible and easy to pass through tight spaces.- Multiple ways to access the video feed. Bring able to use my laptop/desktop, phone, tablet, or the Reolink recorder to access the interface and recordings is really nice. Especially when it came time to position the cameras. Bring able to see the camera view in my phone made the process a cinch.- The motion tracking system is great for maximising the recording time and minimising unneeded recordings and alerts.- Plenty of other cameras for specific needs that are 100% compatible and just plug.- Lots of extra ports for more camerasCons: ( these are rather minimal)- mounting screws strip very easily. This is a very common problem with screws in general now days. I really suggest not bothering with the included ones and great a pack of number 6 wood screws- Setting the motion sensitivity is a little tricky. Not really a complaint, but it does take a fair amount of tinkering to get it right for your needs. I suggest taking your time and don't expect to get it correct the first time.",This review also applies to these additional Reolink cameras I purchased along with this system: ,"Received promptly with two extra dome cameras, as ordered. This is my third system - same location, just keep upgrading to new, better technology. My initial reaction is that this is a great system for home surveillance. I haven't disconnected and replaced the existing one yet but it should be easy as I was already using Ethernet cables (but I had to put converter baluns at each end - now I can just remove those and use existing cat5 and cat 6 cables). But I have fired it up on my desk and connected it to internet and all 10 cameras to be sure all was working.I have to say, while I'm pretty techie and have set up two prior systems, I was AMAZED at how simple and fast it was to set this up for access on my home network PC's, and on my iPhone and iPad. I used a DDNS internet setup in the past but did not need it for this system. It basically just set itself up once I downloaded the PC program and the iOS apps. I refuse to buy anything that has to use the manufacturer's website for internet access - with or without a fee. This works purely over internet with no need to go through REOLINK's servers - perfect! Some other popular brands are not so flexible.Cameras appear way more clear and sharp than my existing system. I ordered 2 extra cameras - the RLC-422 dome cameras with zoom. I have zoom cameras now but you have to use a small screwdriver at the camera to change the zoom to suit the location. I was surprised to find that these can be zoomed remotely using the software. Very nice - and focus adjusts automatically when zoom is changed.Came with virtually everything I needed - you'll want to get a small monitor to connect to the NVR (I got a lightweight 21.5"" HDMI full HD monitor for about $100 that sits nicely on top of the NVR) as my existing one was ancient technology.I did upgrade the NVR firmware to one released less than a month ago - very easy to do but be aware that it will take around 45 minutes with no indication of progress. I was about to e-mail their support when it beeped that it was done and then re-started. Had to re-enter all of the set-up info. so do this before you get too far into things.So far, I'm very happy with this purchase, especially for the price - a good value compared to other more advertised brands.","Updated: I've had this for 2 years and still love it. It's indispensable for keeping my farm animals safe, seeing what's going on around the property day and night. Our setup is 16 cameras with total 2500 feet of cable; The cameras have been out in the rain, snow, ice, summer heat, dust and still work great.Reolink support has been awesome - only needed them a couple of times over the past 2 years -- first was a mysterious config issue which they diagnosed and solved; the second was last week when the transformer went out. We're out of warranty now but they still helped to diagnose the issue and we're back in action.Just having it out of commission for a few days showed us how much we rely on it. Being able to see that all is well inside the barns at 2am - wonderful. Even have a camera on the homing pigeons (yeah) - so fascinating to see them doing their thing when humans aren't around.We still just sit and watch it. If we have visitors, we all sit and watch it. Ok, that may be weird.Here's my original review --Day 3 and I love it. I started intending to buy 1 camera, bought 8, added 4 more. Now up to 12 and figuring out that I need (ok, want) more. My use is for farm cam to keep an eye on animals, so night vision/audio/POE and being affordable enough for multiple locations were my key purchase requirements. Has already brought invaluable peace of mind, and is just plain fun to watch (yes, we sit watching the security cameras). The color image is very nice; the night vision is great. I have it inside a goat barn, horse barn and pigeon loft and it is very clear even in nighttime low light (when it goes to black & white). I don't know that it would be mug shot level quality, but I do know I can tell which goat is being bad in the dark goat barn now. Also have it on several outdoor areas, where it's color late into the evening.Instructions are simple, but too simple and lacking some detail I would have liked; would have been nice to note somewhere that password needs a number (and special character?). Without any error message, that was just trial and error. Kind of a bummer for first experience with it, but once I was through that bit, everything else was so easy. POE is the way to go. Can't believe I even pondered on that for a day or two like I did. Installing a camera is literally 3 screws, drilling a hole for cable if needed, plugging in the cable on the camera to the ethernet cable, then the ethernet cable to the DVR - done! The DVR defaulted to auto add, so wait a few seconds and the new camera shows up. Maybe I'll put it on the internet sometime (and I can see from other reviewers that can be a project), but for now, straight out of the box and not connected to my network does exactly what I want.Some other notes --1. Another reviewer noted that the trick to audio is to make sure the DVR is set to record audio in addition to the camera being turned on for audio - very helpful.2. I dropped one camera (yes I did) and it wasn't damaged at all. These seem sturdy.3. After figuring out the 3-way articulation, it was easy to set up cameras pointing exactly where I wanted them. Though I went through a phase where things were at various angles (kind of modern art) then realized the barrel rotates too so now everything's level.4. The packaging was hilarious. Did they have a competition to see how much equipment would fit into the smallest box? Everything was well packed and nothing was even out of place. It was just the densest packing job I've seen for a while.5. Really glad I got the 16-channels because now I realize that everything needs to have a camera on it.... meadow, woods, pond....how did we get by without this?6. The night vision gives such a peace of mind; that was one reason I bought this particular camera system. These cameras have 36 IR LEDs, so more than the usual.An added bonus (other than not having to go out to the barn at 2am to check on them) is being able to see the amount of animal stuff that happens when humans aren't around.... fascinating","Had this in place and operational for just under a month now. Upon receipt I tested all the cameras and they all worked, each one was just ""plug and play"", plugged it in and the system saw it and began recording right away. Was really inpress with how easy it was. Ran the cables thru my attic to where I wanted the cameras, installed the camera and everyone of them worked, once again with no problems. Down loaded the app for my android phone from the google play store, and once I enter the appropriate password (that I had assigned) I was able to view each of the installed cameras with no issues at all. This made adjusting the cameras' direction very easy while I was up on the ladder. The app also let me, while reviewing a recorded segment, to copy it to my phone and then email it. Makes it very nice in case you wish to share something you recorded like say with the police. Over all I am very satified with the cameras and NVR. I have all ready purchased a couple of additional cameras to go with my setup. While I have a monitor hooked up to the NVR, for ease I have purchased a 10"" tablet (amazon Fire 10"") and am using it as an wall mounted monitor on the wall near the door, makes it nice to see who's there prior to opening it.Now the cameras that come with it are only 4mp, which works fine for my needs, but the supplied NVR can handle up to 5mp camera if you decide to upgrade later. Just another plus for the system.",958,209,https://www.amazon.com/Surveillance-Supported-Security-Recording-RLK16-410B8/dp/B01C6KUKMY/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=vivint+security+cameras&qid=1640228924&sr=8-7

I like the main console becuase it's sleek looking and has a nice light. I like how easy it was to apply the sensors around my home. I like the remote control for activating or deactivating remotely (from your car, for example). I like the keypad too. The system was easy to install and is a far greater value than the commercial stuff you pay goo-gobs of money to have installed. Honestly, I won't waste my money on those other products. Get yourself a home security system you can install yourself, add the Ring doorbell or something else like it, put a camera outside where you need it and monitor your home from your device yourself. This system is nice because it comes with options. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that it comes with a panic button you can adhere somehwere in your house. My panic button is in the baby's room in case something happens to my youngest.","I currently have Guardian home security which is absolutely worthless.. So I wanted a home security system that I did not require a contract. After reading several reviews from JD Power, US News, and Consumer News and World Report, as well as, customer reviews this was the best choice. I looked at Cove, ADT, Ring and a few others and felt this was best overall for my family. Easy set up, easy to operate. Thougjt I wanted exterior cameras and the reviews were less than favorable I opted to buy and extra indoor camera which I placed in the window and it faces my walkway, front door and driveway I can even see my neighbors door and drive and that works. I've only had it 2 days so i haven't needed tech support. Alarm works well as i have set it off already. I could hear it out in the garage. I will update after I've had it a while.","My partner bought this for our apartment when he was going out of town for a few weeks due to work. I figured we wouldn't need it, because we've never had a problem in our neighborhood, but it's honestly been really nice to have just for peace of mind. Knowing there's a panic button is comforting, the key fob is handy and customer service is quick and reliable. I accidentally set the sensor off when heading out one morning (checked the laundry and forgot there was a sensor on the shed door) and they called right away to check-in. It's a great service they're providing, and I wholly appreciate it.","I’ve had professionally installed security systems in the past and decided to try Simplisafe since it isn’t so pricey and my daughter likes it. I am really happy with the system, which was indeed simple to install and works like a charm!

Rather than adding on a solar panel, I opted to wait for the S40 to come out.I've only had the S40 for a few days, but the solar panel is keeping the battery at a constant level despite sub-optimal camera placement (only receives direct sunlight in the morning).The camera has been responsive in detecting motion during both the day and night (people, dogs, cars, deer). The alerts arrive within a few seconds of motion and the app is responsive overall.The integrated solar panel is good for aesthetics and makes it much less obtrusive. Recommended so far!Edit: FWIW I use Unifi access points and haven't experienced any of the drop out problems that other users are reporting, but buyer beware.","I have used many of eufy’s products before and the experience is very good. This time the S40 integrated solar panel cam caught my eyes, OK Forever power, so I decided to purchased one to expand the monitoring range of my home. The setup is just as easy as usual. The design is cool. The picture quality is high and the night vision is also very clear. This camera has certain requirements for the installation position. It is necessary to find an installation point that can illuminate the sun as much as possible, but it’s actually very easy because you can place it anywhere you want. The solar panel has a good charging effect. My camera has been kept fully charged. This function is very good. Well, avoid the trouble of repeated charging.By the way, I encountered the problem of connection stability at the beginning, and it will appear offline. I tried to look for technical support from eufy. They responded quickly and helped me with my problem. This problem was solve in the latest software version. Great product comes from a responsible team. Good job eufy.","I must apologize for my negative review on this security camera. When I ordered this the FIRST time and tried to connect to my wi-fi, it would not connect. I called Eufy customer support and we tried everything, and I mean everything to make it work. Customer support told me it is defective and to return it. I bought one at BestBuy and guess what, didn’t work. I tried a third one and didn’t work. I then took this to a friend’s house to give it to him to see if it would connect and guess what. It worked!!! I called customer support again (spoke to a very helpful person) and she checked with an Eufy engineer about the problem. We found out that if a wi-fi password has ANY SPACES (even if they are intentionally there) it will not connect. I changed my wi-fi password and it almost immediately connected! I feel awful about the negative review I left. I erased it and I have to say this is one awesome camera!! I highly recommend!!!I’m sorry Eufy!!!😔","I purchased this camera a few months ago and happy with this purchase. The video quality and motion detection function great.

Luckily it only drains about 1% a day. (Not camera’s fault)Does not have the ability to insert a SIM card or cloud storage for 24/7 recording.Overall: There is some room for improvement but overall, I am extremely pleased with this purchase. Make sure you get a good bit of sun in your area.","This security camera has been up and running since December 1 and other than the install on the garage eave by an old man on a ladder, there are no issues with its operation. I did survive the ladder install and the camera is securely in place. The solar panel works great and I have a good field of view picture down the driveway and surrounding area. Motion detection and picture quality is good both day and night. I have had no connectivity issues and I am certain my wifi extender plays an important roll in strong wifi connection.Loom wifi extender: I purchased a Loom extender from Amazon and its helps bring a very strong signal with no drop off of signal. Shortly after receipt of the Loom extender I could no longer find the product on Amazon. I am not sure why it is no longer offered but I am certain it plays a major role in the great and stable signal and picture I am able to get on this camera. It is still available from Loom online but the extender has mysteriously disappeared from Amazon web site. Just curious....Why was this product dropped??? I highly recommend it also.Anyway, I am very happy with this camera and extender and I highly recommend both products if your in the market.

Works well for the backyard.,Wireless Freedom - Ring Cam Battery,"New Camera, New Update!!","I have a Ring pro on my front door and loved it so much that I wanted something for the back patio since I have contracts (lawn, pool, trees, etc) in my backyard. My challenge however is that all the walls on the patio are either stucco or rock, which makes it near impossible to run a hidden power line. So I opted for this option and so far it works great. The lights are pretty bright and the motion detection works as expected.As for the battery life, it has been in for a couple weeks and it has lost about 10% battery. So I’m guessing it will last about 3 months before it needs a charge. I just ordered a second battery which should double that battery life.The connection is very quick, it seems to connect much faster than my front door, but in fairness it is closer to the wireless router.As for installation, I installed it using the provided screws into the frame of my patio door. It actually works perfect there because you can’t really see it and allows me to perfectly position it for motion detection.My only complaint is the motion zone setup. Unlike the ring pro where I can “draw” motion zones (which significantly helps reduce motion alerts), it only allows you to specify a distance. It really isn’t very intuitive, so I just leave it at mid-range and it seems to work just fine for now.Beware, in order to have video playback, you do have to subscribe to the ring premium service. And you have to have a subscription per device! I have it for my front door, not sure I’m gonna pay for the back door. That was kind of a bummer to find out I’d have to pay more. It should be a household subscription.Overall, I’m very happy with the device and would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to install solution without wires.",,We have this camera for the backyard and also the ring doorbell for the front door. We got the doorbell first and think it does the job. It is not the best nor is it the worst. Now the camera for the backyard is very nice. We got it as a safety precaution because we felt someone had used the pool while we were away and did not want that to be a safety issue. As you can see in these live pictures I just took that it covers pretty much the whole yard and you can zoom into areas on the app with your finger. Also pictured. We have the sensor set Just right to capture the movement in the backyard. At night when motion is detected the lights fire up to record. There is also an option to push an alarm on the light. It’s not super loud but loud enough for the neighbors to hear and scare persons away. I have also included a screenshot of the app view of the ring items we have.I would recommend this camera but really recommend using the solar panel with the camera and not have to worry about taking the battery out to charge it.,"Love the freedom of wireless, the solar panels work great and only need a couple of hours of sunlight per day to keep the batteries topped off. Video quality is great and I've got eyes on the whole yard now. Just picked up 3 of these beauties. Simply system anyone can install and operate. Thank You Ring!!I bought a camera system a few years ago with a hard drive a 4 wired cameras. Wires all over the house and you need a PHD in programming to get the system to work.

It’s frustrating because most outlets are not near high ceilings or places you would put a camera . So although it lives up to the hype and is truly a GOOD PRODUCT these pictures should be reported for false advertising.","So far so good. We've been using Yi products for a while, but have had some issues with them lately. We hooked these up today and they are just as easy to setup as the Yi cameras. The video is crisp and the audio is clean. I give them 5 stars and will be ordering more once these have stood the test of time for a bit longer.Update: 12/12/20I've been using these for a little bit now and they are so much better than the Yi cameras I used to have. One of the biggest perks is that they do not require that you subscribe to their cloud service in order to view multiple cameras on the screen. Only draw back to these is that they don't have a Windows app to view cameras. Only android and iPhone. However, you download the Blue Stack emulator for windows and it's like having an Android on your windows desktop. These cameras are perfect! Everything about them is so much better than the Yi.","We got these with the vague idea that we could monitor our kiddo and babysitters while out on date night. But with Covid, date night is a thing of the past. Let's hope I'll need these more in the future.I installed them already and actually I've really enjoyed being able to monitor different rooms in my house from my phone. It's nice that you can see the feed from every camera on one screen, or just do one at a time so you can see more detail. The picture is pretty good, clear enough that you can tell what's going on. Sometimes I use them to see how my daughter and husband are doing when I'm at the grocery store, or just to see which room my daughter is in and whether she's making a mess, but that's about it so far. Hoping to get more use out of them in the covid-free future. Anyway, for the price, you really can't beat these.","My husband and I just moved to a much larger city than we are accustomed to and bought this for our own practice of mind when our teenager is home alone. I didn’t expect much since the product was so cheap but let me tell you I was blown away with what I received! The picture quality is much better than expected, the sound quality with speaking through them is great, and the night vision works like a dream! I was expecting them to have cords from reading the reviews and those are the only downside! They are a little short but super easy to hide and extensions aren’t expensive to purchase!

The set up of the mini was FAR EASIER than the outside cams. I had this thing set up in less than 5 minutes. Picture is good. Sound is LOUD which is what I was looking for.The app however needs some work to support this style of camera. The app works decently for the BlinkXT cameras and functionality, which is motion for most users. As in you get a notification that there is motion, it records, and you watch the recording or live as you please. but it is clunky to get into the Blink Mini for the purpose of continuous viewing which is my intention for this camera, like a baby monitor. Like many other Americans now working from home with a full house of kids, I wanted to use this to assist with keeping an eye on the kids as I worked and record those cute moments. I wanted to use this to visualize a blind spot that I can’t see from the office. I tried mounting it from the ceiling and realized you can’t rotate the video. Mounting on the wall was a little problematic, I couldn’t quite get the right angle needed.Another quirk to the app is if you switch to another app and then come back to the Blink app, you have to hit the play button to resume viewing.All in all, these are minor issues specific to my use of the camera which is why I have it five stars anyway.Hey amazon/Blink, it would be an awesome feature if you’d allow the integration of this camera with Alexa so we can “drop in” and talk through the Echo Dot. Just saying.",I love this lil camera!! Easy to install! Only took 5 min and it works great!! Highly recommend this!!,Great price and product. Connected very easily to my existing Blink system. I am not happy with having to pay for storage after trial ends.,"This is a great little camera monitor. Pros: easy set up, easily managed with your smart phone, clear image quality with motion detection. Can be set up to arm and record at any time. I bought this to use in my master bedroom by my desk where I keep sensitive information.Cons: if you are using it with another Blink product and you arm 24/7 then the other Blink unit also needs to be armed which is an issue because my other unit uses 2 AA batteries. There is no timer on the app to set up a time to arm which would by useful because I sometimes forget to arm at night. It has good night vision quality. It needs to be plugged in so is a problem if you put it in a place (i.e. bedroom closet) if there is no outlet. Because of this, it is difficult to make the camera more hidden (if you are looking for a nanny camera for example).Overall it is easy to use and I would recommend it for a basic home security camera.","SO...I rarely write reviews but was so amazed by this camera I wanted to let others know. I bought the camera after using the Ring indoor camera for twice the price and it made a constant clicking noise with the filter adjustment to light in the room that was a known issue Ring told me and not a defect. I've tried all the other brands out there WYZE, etc and disappointed with all. Then I tried the Blink Mini which I thought was a good price. The setup was a breeze, up and running in 30 seconds. The app is responsive and user friendly. My wifi is sloooow but it still loaded a 1080p HD quality view w hen I accessed it from my mobile app. My favorite feature is the night vision. All my previous cameras just showed a dark room or shadows but this camera shows a clear and crisp picture in pitch black darkness. Very pleased with this and you can't go wrong here.

Just a few years ago cellular trail cameras cost hundreds of dollars, and the average hunter could only imagine what it was like to not have to make the drive to check cards to see what was happening on their hunting property. But in 2019, all that changed. With SPYPOINT always working to make cellular trail camera technology an affordable option for all hunters, the LINK-MICRO debuted as the most affordable cellular game camera ever. This model connects to the USA variable zone network. The LINK-MICRO was designed to give hunters the features that they needed to have an effective cellular camera, but to avoid including a lot of things that just added price and complexity. The camera is managed entirely through the SPYPOINT app. There is no menu screen on the camera itself, which allows it to not only be incredibly affordable, but also one of the smallest cellular camera designs ever produced. Let the LINK-MICRO be your introduction to the mobile scouting solution, and how much better a hunter you can be because of it.

If you’ve looked at cellular cameras in the past, but thought they were too expensive, the LINK-MICRO has completely changed expectations of cellular trail cameras.,ULTRA-COMPACT DESIGN The LINK-MICRO is remarkably small for any trail camera, but even more so when you consider it is a cellular camera. This design makes the LINK-MICRO easy to conceal, and keeps wary eyes from spotting the camera.,REDUCE HUMAN IMPACT Nothing impacts the game you hunt more than human pressure. Moving your scouting camera strategy to a cellular approach allows you to visit your hunting areas less, thereby reducing the stress on the animals that live there. No longer do we need to trade knowing what’s happening for the lack of human presence.,MOBILE SCOUTING SOLUTION SPYPOINT delivers the definitive mobile scouting solution for the modern hunter.

That is quick.Second quick thing was the setup. Had hard time with some previous cameras where you need to switch off your 5G Wifi but thought to give a try and guess what it literally took less than 1 minute to setup.All you need is to Install the APP, turn on the camera, Add the camera and scan the QR code in front of the camera and its up and running. Quickest setup ever for any wifi camera. Installing the camera only took 4-5 mins.Result of the camera is also great for both day and night. I can easily read the license plates.

I got hooked on the first camera and I kept finding other places that I wanted to monitor for the occassional human visitor (driving up our long driveway) but mostly for the wildlife, since we live in the country.This latest edition to my collection (received 1 week ago) seems more clearer, the angle wider, the picture clearer and the signal stronger (67% - located over 100 feet from my router extender) . I like how the case extends over the front of the camera and keeps drops of rain off of the lens versus the others I have. I strongly recommend the ZUMIMALL brand and their products. Their customer service is great also. They are quick to respond and very helpful. I misplaced the tiny mounting screw to my ZUMIMALL Doorbell camera and asked how to go about getting a replacement. Soon after I sent the email, I got a positive response that indicated that they would send me a replacement screw (no cost to me). I'm looking forward to see what ZUMIMALL comes out with next. Thank you ZUMIMALL!!!","I bought this after my neighbor had a car window smashed in during the night. I needed to make sure if it happened to me, I was protected. I already had a zumimall camera, so it was a no brainier to buy this one. I've been using the other one for quite a while now - only difference is this one came with a solar charger. Huge benefit. I was able to mount it in an area that is impossible to reach without a ladder. I use an SD card to backup the alarm video that it records. It does not sound the alarm over a passing animal, only vehicles and people. The night vision is awesome. I'll include a daylight screenshot and a nighttime screen shot for reference. I'm very happy with this camera, and excited that I don't even have to pull it off the wall to charge anymore.","This review is for the Zumimall ZS-GX1SI was in the market for a wireless camera to use to investigate employee theft. I needed something that was motion activated and would be able to be hidden in a stockroom and record wrong doings. I came across this item because it seemed like it would do the trick and then I could repurpose it to record vehicles since it was fully wireless I would not need to install a power line to it.Reviewing the owners manual they offer a free 3 year warranty extension if you follow the site they provide. The app required is called CloudEdge App. A microSD card (up to 128GB is required to record videos when the sensor detects movement).Battery- Manual states the camera has a built in 10,400mAh 18650 battery which can be used for 3-6 months assuming the camera wakes up to 15 times a day playing video only 10 minutes. There is a solar panel option for fully wireless charging. I could see this thing being used for a high tech trail camera.I was able to set up the camera while still being connected to a charging cable. So I guess you could use it as a wired camera? The app set up had voice prompts which was nice. It walks you through the setup and you enter your wifi password into the app. The app generates a QR code, you then point the camera towards your phone and the camera will snap a picture of the code to configure itself. MUCH better and faster than having to log into the camera and toggle back and forth. The longest part for me was pulling up my Wi-Fi password since it is long and complex.Video quality is acceptable. App has nice features such as battery life and status. It will also show the signal strength and mac and IP address. You can save to the cloud or use the app to access video files saved on the micro SD card.

I can honestly say this product is easy to install and is of great quality for under $100. I have mounted this camera in my backyard which is mounted to a tree overlooking my back door and and side alley. My camera is mounted up about 15 feet. This camera has great wireless range, excellent battery life, and picture quality is clear.Installation is easy too. Just charge the battery and follow the easy step guide which will guide you through the process. Took less than five minutes to set up. An app need to be downloaded which took a couple minutes.As for installation, just use the easy mounting template then install. The longest time for install is to setup the ladder and then it took me less than 10 min to complete the entire process.All said, I am pleased with the overall ease of installation, quality, and how it performs with the wireless network. I give this product a solid five because it exceeded my expectations.","My first camera. I have seen some from other friends but too pricey. I don’t want the Ring ones because again, pricey. I went for this one and very impressed may I say. Quality is superb! Took me about 10 minutes to mount and install with the app, not kidding, 10 minutes tops. The only thing I didn’t like was that it’s not easy to adjust the position. You have to unscrew little screws and move it, if it was easier to move this would be the PERFECT camera but it’s a great and I mean GREAT camera. You will not go wrong if you buy this. Imma buy another 2 for my front door and patio. They’re awesome!","I have been a devoted Soliom user since I bought my first solar wireless security camera several years ago. I had always wanted to have security cameras, but didn't want to get involved with running and concealing wiring and Soliom was the solution with its combination of solar power and rock solid wifi connections.While the S90 and S600 are excellent products and still in use on my property, after multiple summers of 110+ degree days which caused no problem, the B10 takes it to a whole new level. In the first place, the footprint is significantly smaller and the unit less heavy than it's predecessors, yet retains all of the functionality and perfomance is even more enhanced. Because it is small and lightweight, installation is a breeze, and it quickly and easily paired with my router, although it is a fair distance away. As soon as it ws paired, I began to see a brilliant HD picture and a quick test revealed that the 2-way intercom was loud and clear on both ends. Even better, the false alarms often triggered on previous models by tree branches blowing in the wind, were virtually eliminated by the new PIR smart technology. This is enhanced even further by the new ability to program times of operation and a siren that can be set, along with a bright light, to alert the homeowner and to frighten away possible intruders. As with all of my Soliom cameras, it charges fully each day under our bright desert sunlight, and seems to retain its charge even on cloudy days, although I have not had this long enough to use it through the Winter, but based on my experience with my other Soliom cameras it should be more than adequate for a stretch of cloudy days. In the few instances when I have needed some technical support, I found Soliom customer servcie to be both competent, prompt and genuinely concerned with customer satisfaction. For all of the above reasons, I have given the Soliom B10 a five star review and recommend it without hesitation to anyone needing a solar powered wireless security camera, at a very reasonable price.","If your looking for a Solar powered, 1080p, Wifi Security Camera, Spotlight, Color Night Vision, Two-Way Talk, Siren Alarm, and Motion detector camera at an affordable price, this is it!! Soliom added an 10ft extension cable to mount the solar panel away from the camera. You can practically mount the camera anywhere now.. so many possibilities! This is another great product from Soliom.

Worth it,Couldn't be happier,Amazing PoE camera system for reasonable price,"Great system, with some hiccups",decent package - Steve from Customer support is great.,"I have purchased the 8 channel 5mp POE video surveillance system and I am happy with it.The camera system has an internal storage space of 1tb which is very convenient.I have the cameras recording 24/7 and found that the weekly overwrite on the NVR (due to space limitations) was too quick for my needs.Installed POE via NVR to camera with cat 5e cable and installation is easy. Basically, plug and play.If the cables will be installed outside I recommend using exterior direct burial cat6 cable because the cables that are included are for interior applications. What I really liked was the fact that you are able to view it TV to nvr , and computer and cell phone via cat 5/6 internet connection from nvr to router. There is also live view and playback features.There are no monthly security company fees which is great. There are also lots of settings for motion detection, sensitivity, motion detection zones, email alerts, and app alerts. The night vision is also acceptable it helps a lot to have lighting in the viewing area.Customer service was also top notch. I had a small issue with one of the cameras. Betty helped and replaced it with zero problems. The response time was swift and all in all I cannot complain about the system. It’s well worth the money and the picture quality, playback and features are excellent.This home security system has met or exceeded nearly all my wishes and expectations.",The whole system is working great. The only issue I had was 2 out of 4 cameras build condensation inside the lens... I tried contacting support I supplied proof a few weeks ago and have yet to hear anything back about it. I am a little upset about it as it was a christmas present for my father...UPDATE: from 3 star to 5 star.Smonet honored their warrenty and replaced both cameras with little hassle... I even got to keep the faulty ones. That is good business right there...,"For my money, this SMONET 5MP security system is the absolute best in its class. Installation and setup are quick and easy, and the image quality is crisp and sharp day or night. Installation was straightforward. This is a PoE (Power over Ethernet) system, so I pulled the new CAT 5e cables. I made up a plywood drill guide to accurately drill the screw and cable holes in my soffits. With the cameras installed and the CAT5 cables in place, all that's left is to hook up the NVR. Since I usually live-view or playback when I'm away from home, the app is a crucial component. The phone app is excellent. The app also supports remote control PTZ (pan/tilt/zoom) cameras if you decide to add one or more to your system. The system comes with 4 PoE cameras, but the NVR supports up to 8, so you have room to upgrade. The playback feature is also excellent. It's quick and easy to navigate to the time period you want to replay. Simply tap the date and then select the time block (the recordings are saved in roughly 1-hour blocks). Drag the slider to find the exact period you want to replay, then tap the camera icon for a still photo or the movie icon to start recording video. I do wish there was a 30 second skip forward/back option, as this would make finding the exact moment of interest a little easier. Photos and videos are saved to local storage, you can playback video from hard drive remotely anytime anywhere. The system also supports push alerts to your phone. You can choose which cameras to send alerts and choose the portions of their fields of view to ignore so as to reduce false alarms. The motion detection is very sensitive, so I'd recommend selecting only the key ares, like your front steps and mailbox lid. Alerts are almost instantaneous. In conclusion, I would recommend this product to friends, family, and co-workers. The ease of installation is incredible, simply plug and play. If you have to through walls, or into the attic, well, that up to the home owner and has nothing to do with plug and play features","I really wanted to like the system. After a really hard, time consuming 4 days labor to run cables through the attic I finally got the system working. 3 weeks in, everything was working great with all 8 cameras. Then, the horror! Suddenly instead of displaying my 8 cameras on the screen like it used to, it started showing me a 9th spot with an ipc disconnect message. It was a bit annoying, but since I could still see all of my 8 cameras, I didn't let that bother me too much. 2 weeks later, aug 1st, 2020, the menu language just change to chinese, out of the blue. Now I only have visual on 6 of my cameras, 2 of them are dead. There's no way to even attempt to fix anything, as everything is in Chinese now on the screen. Very disappointed with this one. Picture quality is very good, but as for as the software running the system, it's a complete nightmare. Don't make the mistake I made buying this one.Update 8/12/2020Support was right on the ball. They reached out to me and got the language fix and the cameras are back working normally. It looks like it takes time to reply, about 24 to 48 hours. That's why I updated my rating.","Decent camera system that allows you to build a better system around the NVR. Cameras are lower end but they get the job done especially if you're not using the motion detection. The cameras appear to not have built in motion sensors. This works ok if you have a background that's mostly static. However, add in a tree and some wind and you're getting 99+ alerts in a few hours time. The Cameras infrared LEDs are faint but still visible attracting bugs at night causing even more false alarms.The NVR is Onvif compatible and *may* support add on cameras. Since purchase I have added a few extra cameras of better quality and the NVR works with them after a little configuration. Also note I was able to capture the camera's RTSP stream from ZoneMinder so you can tweak the motion detection a little further if you like.This is not a bad system especially if you're recording 24/7 and not concerned about motion detection. The NVR works out of the box with the included cameras and mostly stays out of your way when adding 3rd party Onvif Cameras.",300,150,https://www.amazon.com/SMONET-Security-8-Channel-Recording-Surveillance/dp/B0821C2C2C/ref=sr_1_22_sspa?keywords=vivint+security+cameras&qid=1640228924&sr=8-22-spons&psc=1&smid=A1CJJSDI4LYOU1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEySlkyMU9CWVROU004JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODcyODUzRjVaTEtUMkczOEhQJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxOTM4NjkxNlhSS0lJN0RTOENJJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYnRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

You can move the camera around from the app which is really cool and if you put it in the right place you can cover a ton of area. The solar panel holds the batteries and there is room inside of 6 18650's which is probably a bit of overkill, it comes with 3 installed and room for 3 more, unless it's dark for days on end the 3 batteries should be plenty, but always good to have options. The motion detection is spot on and starts quickly, works much better than my Ring doorbell. Overall awesome high end security camera.",Amazing 👏 technology advanced security camera..Swivel using app is incredible coupled with Zoom feature is outstanding...than on top of that the Solar charging as you can see in my picture is by far one of the best features....Totally wireless and with the WiFi feature...Pictures are only in SD that I took but it has the HD feature by simply tapping in app...Alert settings are amazing as seen in my pics. Without question a bargain for the money! Easy install and connection!,"Cameras work as advertised (I have 2). I ordered extra batteries (18650) from Amazon (separately) and added them in to the cameras. As with all cameras, finding a good mounting position is the hardest part. This one needs to have a good wi-fi signal, which means you will likely have to add an outdoor wi-fi extender or outdoor wired LAN antenna, or indoor wi-fi extenders on inside walls closest to outside camera location. I ordered wifi-extenders (TP-Link AC750 WiFi Extender RE230) separately also on AMZN, and setup up the extenders and cameras inside, prior to installing cameras outside. Had to move extenders to various locations inside the house to get best connection to camera and to base wi-fi. SOLIOM+ App seems to work pretty good, and camera stays connected to wi-fi. All wi-fi problems so far have been with my signal & extenders, not the camera as far as I can tell. My camera (and solar panel) are in shade under trees, and we have had several dark stormy days, but after several weeks I have had no battery charging issues, and cameras have stayed online all the time, day and night. I also added memory cards (SD) to each camera before installation. I record all video to SD.I tried to activate the free (7-day?) Trial Cloud video storage via the SOLIOM+ app on my phone, but it just didn't work. I wanted to test that Cloud storage before sending any money for a paid account, but that's on hold until I can try to get the free Trial to work. Camera video quality is great, day and night -- I use the night vision mode by turning off the cameras light and use IR. Pan/Tilt works good, but you should know that is is in 'fixed increments' when you hit the app p/t buttons. There is no optical zoom, but you can 'zoom' in the app with normal phone 2-finger touchscreen operation. Also, there is no way to view video through any other means other than their SOLIOM+ app on the phone. A firmware upgrade would be greatly appreciated that allows standard network access from camera to software like Blue Iris. Most camera makers seem to have proprietary software or apps so this maker is not unusual. 1 drawback is (at maximum movement sensitivity) camera misses some activity (cars and people in driveway). There is also a 'glitch' (I would call it), where motion is activated just fine, but recording stops at your preset time limit, even though motion continues. There will be no added video either on the original clip or on additional clips. All additional motion is just not recorded. On the other camera which is viewing only yard, (versus driveway, cars, people), motion is activated for leaves falling and bugs flying by. None but the most expensive (several times $cost of this one) have great motion control so this isn't a complaint given the price of these cameras, just be aware of some of the limitations of less expensive cameras like this one. So far this camera has operated in weather from 80's down to upper 20's (F) and in lots of rain without any problem. 1 big problem is that when recording to SD card, you can only *view* the saved video on your phone (in the SOLIOM+ app), but you cannot download the video and save it to your phone or anywhere else -- you have to open the camera, take out the SD card, then copy the video clips that way - which is pretty ridiculous. That is probably the only reason NOT to get this camera. I assume, but have not tested it, that video on their cloud service would be downloadable to a PC or something. There are video capture apps for android that may help to capture the video while you play it on your phone, but I have also not tried any of that. SOLIOM+ app should be updated ASAP to allow downloading video from SD to phone storage.","We love the pan, tilt, zoom option and the video quality is great. The setup is extremely easy. You can add 3 extra 18650 batteries for backup power but it's not really needed. You can store/review the files on your micro SD card or the cloud. If you want to use the cloud, they have 3 different price plans as shown in the pics. So far so good, really happy with this purchase.",,3423,1,https://www.amazon.com/SOLIOM-S600-Outdoor-Security-PTZ-IP-Camera-Activated-Spotlight/dp/B083TX4J2D/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=vivint+security+cameras&qid=1640228924&sr=8-20

Smart Lights & Siren, WPS2K84-1TB)",$299.99,IT girl is impressed,My Upgraded System . . .,Best Wi-Fi Camera System,Smart Security system,Long time I looked at DVR Camera Systems,Outdid my expectations.I work in IT security. I set up and configure cameras in a facility so I shopped around and decided on this product for my home.These cams have excellent quality and the software is pretty easy to use once you're familiar with the menus and settings.App works flawlessly on wifi although it will sometimes take a bit to connect on 4G data service on your device.I'm into techy things and I totally geeked out on setting this up. It was a lot of fun.(Pretty simple for an average user)My favorite feature is the two way audio. I show it off all the time.,"My previous camera system consisted of individual cameras using my existing home WiFi. It was manageable but each camera had it's own IP address which slowed down my network and was not east to use. After spending time reading reviews, I settled on the XMARTO Wireless Security Camera System as a stand alone system that is independent of my home WiFi. I watched a few YouTube videos and had it up and running in an hour. I installed them and am quite pleased with the quality of the equipment and the images. I intend to purchase four more cameras to max out this system.","Best Camera system Period.After spending months of research, weeding out the paid reviews when you search best camera system the information many times does not include the best, it is about money and sponsors and if you have read many of these reviews it doesn't take too long to figure out they are catering to certain companies and many of these websites are ran by the same people,I have came to the conclusion that this is the best Wi-Fi Camera System on the market with the best price. I read what other people say and go by word of mouth.Most people wont read everything but I advise to read if you are in the market, I will sum it up, the expound a bit. All of what Xmarto says is true, take time to read all of their details.Best Price, Best Service, Best Support, Best Night Vision, Best Picture Quality, Best Features, Best WiFi Range. Best Camera Detection. Also works like a security light too (recommended by me) You have night vision mode and can leave flood lights on always or put it in smart mode.Detection good, in fact it is too good, I had to dumb it down a bit because it detected traffic from a different street. Great range, I even have a fantastic signal from out in my detached garage.It has a special repeater system on its own Wi-Fi system that you can connect to your internet wired or by Wi-Fi. You do not have to if you do not want to view it remotely because it stores on its own NVRs large Hard Drive and you can view it from there. Or connect to your Wi-Fi and watch your home from around the world. I have the app on an old iPhone 8 and a 2013 Toshiba laptop. It is also viewable from my wife's iPhone11.The night vision is the best of any camera system that I have owned and Daylight is great. You can set the cameras in Auto mode so when it detects motion the bright led lights light up, like a motion sensor security light and you get full color like it is daylightBecause I am not to tech savvy I had to use there support and they responded very quick with the information that I needed in an understandable format. Than I had a small issue with one of my cameras, perhaps it was damaged in shipping. It was packaged well in an Xmarto box and then packed in an amazon box, but things happen. After contacting their support dept., they had me try a couple of things, then sent me a new camera and I received it in 36 hours. They have 2 way sound and an alarm which can be set to go off on motion or you can push an alarm button like a panic button.They have a cloud feature I am not sure if I am going to use it because my videos are stored local but I may as a layer of protection like my house catches on fire, the cloud would save my video.I can attach some screen shots and pictures but they do not do justice to real life.All photos attached to this review were taken at night. the first 3 photos are pictures taken of a 42 inch TV you can see 4 different cameras, then click and you can enlarge video to full size of TV, second picture is taken with camera night vison, 3rd is camera floodlight (you can see color at night. the last 2 pictures are iPhone screenshots. The camera will show more but the view is blocked partially by deck, but that is the way I want it to see people approaching front door. The cameras also zoom inEasy to set up, easy to operate","My dad and I are running a small business locally but things got really tough nowadays. We were worried about our safety. That's why I bought this XMARTO security camera system for our store. To be honest, this is not one of the cheapest but it has all the features that we need. First it was super easy to install. We only spend about 20 mins mounting and organizing the cables. The NVR box is capable of hosting 8 cameras. This set has 4 cameras which will be more than we need for the store. The video is sharp and smooth. More importantly, it comes with pre-installed hard drive so no need to put the box and put an extra hard. Last but not the least, it has its own app which allows my dad and I check it wirelessly. Also, it can send motion alert!",The only thing I wonder about is long term use .... if that is not a problem a REAL 5 star product/ today I learned you can click on any camera /click on area and zoom in /like a car or persons face wow! WiFi is not perfect but all systems are buggy on wireless BUT this has top quality view and color and night is outstanding. the FPS seems to be slow I think its 30fps divided x4 /still learning how to set motion and other features/already upgraded Firmware on the NVR easy d/l restart solved some distance issues with camera in back of property / for the money ITS GREAT! its not junky /quality cameras dual antennas /we will see as time pass if they hold up/ here comes winter!,263,74,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Camera-WOW2084-1TB-Outdoor-Cameras/dp/B07PKQBB3F/ref=sr_1_21_sspa?keywords=vivint+security+cameras&qid=1640228924&sr=8-21-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEySlkyMU9CWVROU004JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODcyODUzRjVaTEtUMkczOEhQJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxMDc2NjAyRkwzNlM1TldaMkU4JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYnRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

It is IP65 rating, which means it gives protection against low pressure water jets from any direction. As well as condensation and water spray. It is 1080P HD and has both motion detection and night vision. It comes with two storage options, using a MicroSD Card and you can also purchase a subscription to a Cloud Service for storage. The camera also offers 2-Way Audio. The camera has an internal 6700 mAh Lithium-Ion battery that can last up to 5 months depending on usage. It also has a LED light that can be toggled by the app or set to turn on when motion is detected. It also comes with an alarm option with the same features as the light. All controllable/configurable by the app. The camera provide 120 degrees wide angle view.This camera was heavier than I expected and most of that weight is probably the battery. The unit didn’t come with a charge on it. So I plugged it in and about 8 hours later it was fully charged. That was the only thing that took any time. I installed the round metal mount. I liked the quick removal and replacement for charging purposes. The camera has a dome shaped magnet in the back of it. So it snaps right into place and you just move it to where you want to point it and it stays. The magnet is strong and that camera is not going anywhere. It took about 2 minutes to install. It took about 2 minutes to download the app and register. Once that occurs you can attempt to detect the camera once you turn it on. Pairing and configuration was intuitive and straight forward. I had a working camera and app in less than 5 minutes.The camera resolution is quite nice for a wireless camera and in testing, all features and functions performed as expected. The camera will send a notification to your phone when it detects motion so you can check the app immediately and see what is going on. Also it saves the recordings or photos which are accessible from the app. You are able to listen to an activity near the camera or talk to guests in the back yard. The volume is not very loud .. however, it is clear enough to be heard. The night vision has a 33’ range is relatively clear. The 1080P HD is also impressive for a wireless camera. The view does have a slight fish eye view to it.The battery life of the camera is not that great. So to me able to charge it with the solar panel is a plus. The solar panel trickle charges the unit and is enough to keep it up and running. Without the solar panel I had to take it down after about 3-4 days to recharge if you have all the bells and whistles turned on for this unit.The manufacturer offers a 3-Year Warranty on the product.I appreciate you taking the time to read this. I received this product in exchange for an honest review. All in all, this is my second one of these cameras and it is amazing. I have ordered a third for the back yard. It comes with an excellent quality picture and is absolutely wireless. One of the best remote cameras I have come across. Highly recommend this product for the price point. I have not found a better camera for the money. Unless you require pan and tilt or motion follow, this is one of my top picks. All in all, Hope this information was helpful. [5 Stars]","This is by far the best wireless camera you can purchase on Amazon, It took only a few minutes to Install and and the Solar Panel Works perfect. The App is very easy to use and I can login from anywhere to see around my house. I definitely recommend purchasing this. I have purchased 6 of these camera's with Solar Panels and they are all around my house. Its so good having all this security especially in times like these. So don't hesitate to purchase them, you will not regret it.","Being a fan of Zummimal cameras, I decided to purchase one of their related brands. I've had it 6 weeks and have been surprised with some upgrades not on their other battery cameras.This camera can use AI to classify alerts to person, pet, package, or even differentiate if a vehicle is approaching or departing.It accepted a 128gb card after it formatted. Firmware updates have kept improving the already excellent camera clarity and notification speed.Sound is so good that I had to move it so it wouldn't pick up neighbors conversations so clearly. Having a 🚨 is a plus, as well as the ability to use the white light spotlight to see in color.The solar panel has kept it consistently charged. I'm still deciding where to permanently place the camera, but I've been able to keep moving it because it has a magnetic mount and a magnetic hold to metal surfaces built in to the camera too.The 3 year warranty is great peace of mind, but they've also reached out via email to see if I needed any technical support. So far, I haven't. The app on this camera is great. I've hated other apps, so that was a surprise. It's very user friendly, just like the setup. The camera basically talks you through 3 minute setup.It's very easy to recommend this camera, app, and the large level of support.","I use the IOS App (iPhone) for the setup and use of the camera. The setup was very easy, installing the App via a QR was done in minutes. The set up included connecting to your WIFI network, again this was easy and trouble free. Your pictures and videos can be stored on a Micro SD Card; however, the card is not included, and you must purchase this separately. The solar panel charging system works well. Connecting to my WIFI network was simple and took only a few minutes. Both pictures and video are easily saved to either the cloud or your Micro SD card. The night vision is exceptional (IR) and the white light setting for short range color viewing was quite good.All the mounting hardware needed for a secure install was included. I installed the camera in my back yard for added security. The camera is easily removed for re-charging (magnetic mount). The 2-way audio is crystal clear. The interface in the app is very clear and concise, super clean, simple, and easy to use.The build quality is solid, it feels like a very durable and well-built device. It has the heft and feel of a quality product. The magnetic mount is very strong and completely adjustable so that you can aim it where you need it.I was able to check the camera while out of the house, clear pictures and the motion alarms work very well.All in all, this is an exceptional camera, I found it to be easy to set up, maintain and use. I have other ZUMIMALL cameras and found the customer service second to none. They have been very responsive, courteous and go above and beyond to improve their products and satisfy customers after the sale. I had lost my camera mounts and ZUMIMALL sent me two new ones without charge.I highly recommend purchasing their products.",,280,144,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Wireless-Dzees-Flashlight-Detection/dp/B0928NR8PD/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=wifi+security+camera&qid=1640229461&sr=8-10

Great Camera nd Feautres ! get the SD card !,Simple to Install & View,Amazing Camera At An Even More Amazing Price,Great camera at a great price!,Fully loaded features at a fraction cost,"I ordered 2 of these .. installed them at the edge of a 2nd story window looking down .. they cover the street, driveway, and will ""zoom"" when I look on the live feed on my phone . I feel like a genius having connected these myself to the wireless router, and then physically put them up .. the little blue lights they emit advise anyone looking around that the place is being watched and this has got to be the EASIEST surveillence Iv ever had .. downloaded the CloudEdge app ( and it connects both cameras to my phone monitoring in Real Time .. ~ ! one of the cams monitors better than the other and I think its because it attaches to the wireless iNet of my location better because of where I installed it .. (thinking abt changing that, but for now one doesnt really respond as well ..) but I still hav the other one fully operational and can be states away and effortlessly monitor the property .. these are supposed to be for exterior but I hav them inside (for now) the easy part is they plug right into a 110 outlet .. but (Im pretty handy) I could simply splice the wire into same, said outlet and install it exerior no problem .. or .. rig it so the wire goes thru the wall to the plug-in and just seal around the hole and unit with some caulk .. either way these are very easy but you hav to hav a Power Source (see my next-to-last paragraph below for comment on the reviewer who complained about that lol ..) I used to hav to subscribe (yes with a Monthly fee !) to a monitoring website online which kept the survellience footage for me for abt 30 days .. even if I wanted to just View any past footage I had to pay a little extra .. and if I needed to ""pull"" the footage there was an upcharge .. needless to say with these cams (yes yes I know welcome to the 2020s lol) I dont need any of that and at $35/ea I feel like I got a terrific deal . I also purchased the SD card ($12 for 2) which say they are 64gb but they might be less but who cares .. its a flippin DEAL .. ! so glad I bought it .. I havent tried the ""record"" much .. so IDK how much ""memory"" the SD cards truly hav, but I recorded a few seconds on my phone, and it stores it in an ""album"" .. theres only 2 (recordings) there for now .. I sent one to myself and played it so that works too ..the picture on these is not stellar but still very good and enough to make out tag numbers (license plates) and other features plus you can ""zoom in"" .. the night vision is great for the money, though I hav a mercury vapor (very bright) light illuminating where these are watching so dont need the night as much as some areas which might be darker .. I will tell you that placing a light in and of itself is a high deterrent to crime, cameras are a deterrent also, but the combination of light (inexpensive) with security camera is a win-win and something to seriously consider ..gosh I hope these last .. I read a few reviews that stated these quit working after a few months, so if that happens I will definitely update, but for now I hav to giv a whopping 5 Stars ! Lastly I hav to mention this: one reviewer stated the ""wireless"" label was ""misleading"" ... HE THOUGHT YOU COULD GET A POWER SOURCE WIRELESSLY .. !! YOU CANNOT GET POWER FROM ANYTHING WIRELESSLY !! even Solar has to be directed to whatever device you are powering .. I cannot believe the stupidity of such a review ! and then like 12 other people clicked on how ""helpful"" his review was .. !! (what has happned to common sense ??) think abt it: if you could ""wirelessly"" get power we would never hav to charge our phones .. the ""wireless"" is how these cameras interact with the data they can send, store, record, etc .. but these hav a plug-in that you plug into a regular 110 outlet . Simple .OK .. I hoped this helped, if it did for you please show with a ""help"" click as it lets me know what details are the best to include that you might find useful in my reviews (plus I appreciate the feedback) .. I didnt get any incentive, product, or endorsement for my opinion here today .. just like to relate on decent items I buy .. Id say a solid 4.5 stars for these .. half star off for a lesser defintion in the video quality but all-in-all for $35, you just cant beat the Value of this camera, features, etc so Im rounding up .. 5 stars !","This is a great security camera for the money. I mounted it just above my garage door looking down the driveway. The video quality is excellent in both daylight and during night time. The software is very easy to use once you understand all the controls and features. You can set-up areas of the video that you wish to have motion detection which really works great. I like the blue LED on the camera's face that tells visitors they are being watched and suspect it acts as a further deterrent. I would suggest using at least a 64GB, or better yet a 128GB SD card, for storing videos, although you can store them in ""The Cloud"" if you wish to pay a small fee. This company's customer service is great and gets back to you quickly with answers to any questions you may have. This was a very good purchase and 5 stars all around!

But I am still happy with the picture I get. As the main reason I bought this camera was to be able to check on my cats.The camera tilts a little, but wish it tilted more. Otherwise it’s a great camera.It does come with a magnet wall mount, which is neat. But I don’t want to hang on my wall right now.But this camera is worth buying. As I have a brother who has this brand of camera inside & outside his home. At least four of this indoor camera & four outdoor EZVIZ camera’s.","I have had these cameras for over a year now. I have one in my garage, one in my downstairs (can see the walk in of each room with clear view) where my kids rooms, toy room and laundry and 2 bathroom is located. And 1 pointing outside of my front window (it is a corded camera and I didnt feel secure about running a cord outside or pluggin one outside) to show the view of my driveway (which also gives a great and clear view of the business and houses on the street across, as I stay on a busy road). I pay a small fee under $7 dollars a month through the app, which in return keeps the cameras recording and saves the data to its cloud so that i can access the cameras at anytime to playback any video. You do have to have wifi for the cameras to be able to connect.With these cameras I was able to, find out who tried to steal my car and use the video as evidence, find out which one of my kids was last to flood my downstairs toliet.Im sure I will be adding a few more.","Without a doubt this is one of the best buys I've made in a long time. The price was super cheap for the quality of product, ease of setup, quality of the app, etc... I bought this so my father could keep an eye on my bedridden mother without having to be with her all the time (she has Alzheimer's). This simple $25 investment has allowed him the freedom to move about the house and yard without worry. Honestly, this dependable little camera (that also has two way communication!) has changed the quality of his life. I would recommend this product, and have already done so on several occasions, to anyone in need of this type of product and the peace of mind that it brings.",Great picture quality and can set to human detection mode which works most the time.

The LED flood lights light up a large area and are very bright, a great feature and can be turned on or off. Day or night, the camera view distance is impressive, I can see all 4 acre's of my property and well beyond that. I am still learning about the motion detection sensitivity, playing with that now to adjust to my liking. The siren is another great bonus along with the voice communication. Each of those can be turned on or off. Don't bother paying hundreds of dollars on other cameras, this camera exceeded my expectations in every way. I hope to add photos and video when I have more time. I highly recommend the BOAVISION PTZ camera. UPDATE 2/2021; this is one tough camera!

Love that it’s wireless and no longer have a 9 foot cable hanging on my wall. App is pretty intuitive. Alexa integration is great.

They last through snow, wind, rain, and sun. They have amazing low light vision. Clear pictures. And a great setup to last two years on double AAs. And for those who need them to last longer buy the adapter to plug them in. It's stupid how these people come and review these as if they were 5000 dollar security set ups. These are worth it and a great value.",,"We are happy with our blink indoor cameras. It being wireless, light, and battery powered made it easy to install. The motion detection feature allows you to choose sections of the room you want monitored. The night vision is provides good quality captures and we were surprised the battery life is rated for two years. However, please keep in mind that it could change base on how much you use the live view, how often it triggers to record, how long the duration of recording, is set to, and if your wifi signaling is bad.Note: if you have a large area or areas with lots of obstructions (i.e. cement, brick, steel, and aluminum) walls you may want to have a wifi meshed network to extend you wifi network pass these obstructions. We have the Google Nest Wifi system. Also, the blink camera must connect to the sync module via low frequency radio (LFR). Because of this, the camera must be within distance of the sync module. This is separate from your home wifi network. My suggestion is to get another syn-module if you run into issues where your single sync-module cannot cover all camera areas.","The all-new Blink Indoor – wireless, HD security camera appears to be a good product at a reasonable price. I bought a set of three that came with a Sync module. I believe up to 10 devices can be connected wirelessly to the Sync module that communicates using your home wifi. I was able to easily set up the camera using the Blink app on an iPhone. in addition, I was able to link to Alexa using my Amazon Prime account. This helped to view the camera on the Echo View screen using Alexa voice command such as, ""Alexa, show Living Room.""I understand that Lithium AA batteries (supplied with the camera) would last for two years.

However, the Sync module has an USB post and a low profile USB thumb drive upto 256 GB may be used to store video clips in MP4 format.My only complaint is that a detailed User's Manual explaining all these should be included instead of finding at Blink support website.",13123,512,https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Indoor-Wireless-Security-Camera-3cam/dp/B07X5FCW3X/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=wifi+security+camera&qid=1640229461&sr=8-9

I was looking for a camera to put in my son’s room so that I don’t have to follow him upstairs all day long but can still keep an eye on him.The night vision works great. So far the pictures have been very clear. I also really like the fact that you can use this camera live, so you don’t necessarily need an SD card, unless you want to record and don’t want to buy the cloud service. I do plan on buying another camera for my living room so I will be inserting a micro SD in that camera.I will admit I had a very difficult time connecting the camera to my router. I have dual band WIFI through XFinity. The first time I tried to connect the camera it didn’t work. So I did some research and managed to separate my Wi-Fi into the two separate bands: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. (I had them together under one name and password.) I attempted to connect the camera to the router several more times after that but it still wouldn’t connect. I ended up spending an hour trying to connect the camera to no avail.Finally I noticed in the little instruction booklet that it says you can connect your camera directly through the modem (a modem cable is included in the box the camera came in.) Lo and behold I was able to connect the camera within just a few minutes. I then went into the app and changed the setting from modem to WIFI. I sincerely wish I had tried this method within the first few minutes of failing to connect through the Wi-Fi because it would’ve saved me a lot of time and effort. (There was no need to separate the two bands. Ugh!)I hope this helps anyone else who may be having a difficult time connecting their camera.Overall, great little piece of equipment!","I was a little intimidated about setting up this camera. But I followed the directions slowly and calmly, one step at a time, and everything worked with ease. What fun. The picture is really clear. It is cool that you can move your fingers on the camera screen, wherever you are, and the camera head will rotate accordingly. So you can scan the whole room (350o rotation). And the fact that it includes audio is awesome. So it could also be used as a baby monitor or to hear if your dogs are barking, etc. Or you could talk to the baby, dogs, other adults in the room. One drawback is that the camera has to be connected to USB/power. That greatly limits where I can use it. The instructions are very good for setup, but then it is lacking in real directions on how to use it in everyday use. Most things you can figure out for yourself. Although I have an Alexa device, I was not able to use it with Alexa because it requires an Alexa screen device as well. But overall, I like this camera.","Well this little beauty is sweet. It came within 24 hours (thanks Amazon Prime) and in a nice little box and set up was a breeze (iPhone user). Once you download the application via the App Store, the instructions walk you through set up step by step. You do need your WiFi login, and it does not support 5G WiFi. The sound it makes is a little weird during pairing with WiFi/router connecting but it’s temporary, so you’ll get over it, your sleeping newborn- maybe not so much. Once your set up is complete, you can change the settings for motion detection notification and also sensitivity. I tried stealth mode of moving really slow and also trying to play flash lightening and it caught me on both and sent a notification to my phone of said sloth intruder or lightening McQueen in the house. It has a two way speaker so really nice to be able to yell at the dogs or scare the bejeezus out of your roommate. I’m shocked at the picture quality. I was going to upload a picture of myself in it, but the quality is good that I needed a filter- maybe on their next update. Also, kind of cool that nightmode has its own settings (and throwing it back to the 40s with no color to set the Friday the 13th ambiance) so just in case you want to catch ghosts on camera, I’m sure you can set it to Orb sensitivity. Overall, really great quality product and totally worth the money.","Alright so first off, the price. At 30fps and 1080 with all the extra features. It seemed to good to be true. With that being said, I was eager to play with this one. It comes nicely packaged and about the size of a soda can. Has a two hole mount that can be screwed on many surfaces, walls, ceilings. The mount is an easy twist on so the camera can be taken down with ease. The Picture quality honestly blew me away for a 1080. There’s a lot of 1080s out there that just plain suck. Tethys is true to their word on this one. The night vision is slightly under what they say it can do (32ft I believe) but it’s still plenty of range for your buck. The camera movement is smooth as well. You just swipe down to go up and left to go right and so on. The set up was a little bit of a pain until I realized the manual said something different than what the app tells you to do. Basically just have the camera and your phone right next to the router and it hooks up in seconds. Took me a few tries to realize this. The interface on the app is Fairly easy and any beginner can figure it out. The cloud service does cost money I’m not sure how much. All in all this thing is hard to beat for the price and features packed into it. In the photos in my living room there is a sign way back by the kitchen. The next photo is the camera zoomed in on it to show the quality.","Unit was defective when received. Was asked to move to different locations to see if it would help. I did that and after many tries, it still refused to work wihout the irriataing beep,beep either immediately, or after several ours or days.They want me to pay the return shipping. I won't buy from them again!UPDATE:Original Purchase date Nov.30 2019. Today Feb. 24 2020.I finally did get a replacement and this one works very well. Tethys did send the replacement at no cost and sent a prepaid return label to return the defective camera. They are nice cameras. I bought 2 the first time and only one worked, but after several email exchanges, Tethys made good on their warranty and paid the shipping both ways. Tethys truly seemed to wanted to do the right thing after our email conversations, so I am changing my rating to five stars, 4.5 would be more accurate as it did take longer than it should have to resolve the issue. I do belive the product is a quality item, and I just received a defective one the first time.

(Barn is 25 min away and no wifi.)Video is SMOOTH and picture quality is GREAT (screenshots from my camera)! Two settings : hi or lo - I use lowest resolution here, and can easily see if his wraps are undone. Slight lag time on pan/tilt but it's perfectly fine.Moderately easy to set up (Corrine at Reolink tech support emails helped BIG TIME, as upon doing a ""factory reset"" on the camera, everything worked as it should!) and shoutout to #HuntingFarmer for recommending the FreedomPop $5 a month 12-Month Prepaid plan (bought it for $43!). I don't have to worry about data for 12 months - Each time I pop in to view, I use up 2 MB - so I figure, with the 1 GB allotted, I can pop in 500 times a month (= 16 times a day, which is more than I actually use!) without going over.I set it at lowest motion setting, so no recording is triggered - with that, the camera uses up about 2-5% battery a day; unfortunately, the barn has no direct sunlight (did not think of that when I purchased with the solar panel)... but I just hooked up the solar panel anyway and we will see if the battery lasts any longer. Luckily, it's easy to take down for a quick charge.All in all, a perfect, self-sustaining barn camera. Exactly what I've been looking for!",,"I have used the Reolink Go for a few months in a horse stall and its been great. When I needed another camera, I saw that this camera can rotate remotely through the app and has a few more features. It has worked seamlessly in the app and installing the camera was easier than the Reolink go with the guides to drill (I recommend taking a copy of it so just in case you move the camera it is easy to install). I have a tmobile sim card that has worked great.Areas of opportunity:-I do wish it had a removable battery like the reolink go but the other ways to charge it have worked.- If you have more than one reolink camera, you have to update your cloud which is a monthly/annual cost; which I found a bit annoying but the app is great so its been worth it so far.Overall, the picture quality is great and being able to remotely control it through the app has been awesome!","I am extremely happy with this camera / solar panel. I mounted it to the spreader of my sailboat mast using the strap it comes with. I also mounted the solar panel just above it using a zip tie. I did not have to drill any holes in my mast. It has never lost signal, not once! I've been testing it for 2 months now. I can see my boat on the mooring ball using my cell phone anywhere/anytime, I can get alerts if there is an intruder or birds lol, it records when there is motion on the included memory chip. I am blown away at how good it is. I also have another fixed size camera from REOLink inside the boat to see the control panel. That one has been solid as well. I cannot say enough about REOLink!","This is a fantastic camera. The support if awesome too. It took a while to figure things out, but be patient and you may. I found Speedtalk the best sim card provider by far. $8 + $8 per month for 1 GB, which seem to be enough to check camera 2-3 times a day and download some clips here and there. Must have cell reception. GSM, I believe, like T mobile. Do your research please for your situation. Besides catching a thief, I've seen Fox, Coyote and other interesting critters.

See UPDATE,This is COOL!,"There are four different versions of the Ring Light/Cameras. They are: 1. Ring Spotlight Battery Cam ($160), 2. Ring Spotlight Wired Cam ($160), 3. Ring Spotlight Mount Cam ($249) and 4. Ring Floodlight Cam ($249). I currently have three (3) of the Floodlight Cameras installed in my home. Excellent performance on all three. Never had one single problem and their customer support is always there if assistance was needed. I needed a fourth camera to be installed over my front entryway and I ordered the Spotlight Mount Cam because I wanted a unit that was a little smaller. Plus I didn't want to have to deal with batteries (You know when they're going to fail - just when you need them) and I wanted to mount this to a junction box and have no exposed wires. Well that was MY mistake. The thing that I did not know is that the ""Spotlight"" cams do not have the same capabilities of the ""Floodlight"" cams. Here are just a few things that are different with the Spotlight Cam: 1. Reduced light output and coverage, 2. No ability to set it for ""automatic dusk to dawn"" lighting, 3. The lights should not be left on for more then 30 minutes and 4. Reduced night vision capability and resolution. Why pay the same price ($249 for both the Spotlight Mount and the Floodlight models) and get ""less"" capability ?????Ring's customer service was very willing to assist me in obtaining a replacement. The Spotlight cam was replaced with another Floodlight Cam. Slightly larger in size, but overall a much more capable light/camera system and is working flawlessly. THANK YOU RING FOR YOUR SUPPORT!","When the Ring Pro camera sees the EERO Pro mesh router (likely at full strength), it will ask for your Wi-Fi password during set up and unfortunately, after you ENTER IT PROPERLY, it does not connect?!? The Ring Pro camera ""thinks"" you have entered the wrong password, via their app setup, when...THAT IS NOT THE CASE. Then the camera goes from a flashing blue light to a flashing red light...BAD! Ring Tech told me to return the camera because they too thought it was defective.After I got my replacement camera, the same thing happened again. I was pulling my hair out. To verify the Ring Pro camera was working properly, I temporarily hooked the camera to my iPad hot spot and it logged on and worked perfectly! So, I eliminated that the camera was defective itself.What happens is that the EERO Pro mesh system is trying to connect via 5.2 or 5.8 Ghz ONLY!! The Ring Pro camera only operates at 2.4., even though EERO Pro does operate at 2.4 GHz. The mesh system did NOT want to change because the signal strength to the unit was ""excellent"" as it was less than 25 feet away from one of the EERO pods.This time, I walked my iPhone (with the app) about a good 75-80 feet away from the EERO PRO mesh system to ""force"" the EERO to switch down to the 2.4 GHz band, before entering my Wi-Fi password...and THEN IT WORKED!Again...take your phone, with the Ring app, and walk a good distance AWAY from the EERO Pro mesh system to FORCE IT to connect at 2.4 GHz!! Ring support did not know about this. EERO support was baffled. But now they both know! Do this or you will want to return this camera. Now it works great!","This is my second Ring Security Cam, I already have a Ring Video Doorbell 2 in use. Installed the new Ring Spotlight Cam Mount HD without any problems, Ring provides everything you need with this cam, instructions, tools and lots of different screws for different install situations. Installation was a breeze, love the fact Ring is now offering this hardwired model. Also setup was a breeze, firmware got updated instantly, everything works as it should, I have a strong Wi-Fi connection to my Asus ROG Rapture GT-AC5300 router. Video is of high quality (HD) with a very wide angle which I appreciate. One reviewer mentioned it would be nice if there were a possibility to permanently turn the spotlight off, I would support this request because I maybe want to install another Ring Cam in the back porch pool area and here I would not want the light going on and off all the time when I am in the pool area. I can highly recommend this cam, looks like it is made of very high quality materials, works great, happy camper here.","Wired to new floodlight as described on page 42 of the manual. Which basically operates external lights up to 150 watts. 2 different cameras did not operate the lights. They do operate before setup. Once firmware is downloaded, they do not work. Going to return and try another set of cameras.UPDATE: Ring support contacted me about the firmware problem. They have corrected the problem with the external lights. Everything works great. The extra lighting using the external lights illuminated a larger area of the yard. The Ring support was great in resolving this issue. I recommend this cam for anyone wanting to incorporate a cam on existing eve mounted lights.","We bought this after using the Ring Doorbell and seeing how great the doorbell was, we figured this would work just as well. IT DOES!! It's very convenient to see who is meandering around my yard when I'm both home and away. One super cool thing about all the Ring products is the integration with my Apple Watch and iPhone. They work seamlessly together which is very convenient if I don't have my phone nearby. I highly recommend all of the Ring products. The customer service is great too. Always available to answer questions or help with any of their products. In fact, we are adding cameras to the back of our house now. It's not very often that a company maintains its integrity after being purchased by a larger company. Usually that is when customer service begins to suffer and product quality diminishes. Not with RING.

The set up of the mini was FAR EASIER than the outside cams. I had this thing set up in less than 5 minutes. Picture is good. Sound is LOUD which is what I was looking for.The app however needs some work to support this style of camera. The app works decently for the BlinkXT cameras and functionality, which is motion for most users. As in you get a notification that there is motion, it records, and you watch the recording or live as you please. but it is clunky to get into the Blink Mini for the purpose of continuous viewing which is my intention for this camera, like a baby monitor. Like many other Americans now working from home with a full house of kids, I wanted to use this to assist with keeping an eye on the kids as I worked and record those cute moments. I wanted to use this to visualize a blind spot that I can’t see from the office. I tried mounting it from the ceiling and realized you can’t rotate the video. Mounting on the wall was a little problematic, I couldn’t quite get the right angle needed.Another quirk to the app is if you switch to another app and then come back to the Blink app, you have to hit the play button to resume viewing.All in all, these are minor issues specific to my use of the camera which is why I have it five stars anyway.Hey amazon/Blink, it would be an awesome feature if you’d allow the integration of this camera with Alexa so we can “drop in” and talk through the Echo Dot. Just saying.",I love this lil camera!! Easy to install! Only took 5 min and it works great!! Highly recommend this!!,Great price and product. Connected very easily to my existing Blink system. I am not happy with having to pay for storage after trial ends.,"This is a great little camera monitor. Pros: easy set up, easily managed with your smart phone, clear image quality with motion detection. Can be set up to arm and record at any time. I bought this to use in my master bedroom by my desk where I keep sensitive information.Cons: if you are using it with another Blink product and you arm 24/7 then the other Blink unit also needs to be armed which is an issue because my other unit uses 2 AA batteries. There is no timer on the app to set up a time to arm which would by useful because I sometimes forget to arm at night. It has good night vision quality. It needs to be plugged in so is a problem if you put it in a place (i.e. bedroom closet) if there is no outlet. Because of this, it is difficult to make the camera more hidden (if you are looking for a nanny camera for example).Overall it is easy to use and I would recommend it for a basic home security camera.","SO...I rarely write reviews but was so amazed by this camera I wanted to let others know. I bought the camera after using the Ring indoor camera for twice the price and it made a constant clicking noise with the filter adjustment to light in the room that was a known issue Ring told me and not a defect. I've tried all the other brands out there WYZE, etc and disappointed with all. Then I tried the Blink Mini which I thought was a good price. The setup was a breeze, up and running in 30 seconds. The app is responsive and user friendly. My wifi is sloooow but it still loaded a 1080p HD quality view w hen I accessed it from my mobile app. My favorite feature is the night vision. All my previous cameras just showed a dark room or shadows but this camera shows a clear and crisp picture in pitch black darkness. Very pleased with this and you can't go wrong here.

I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't. None. Not a single thing.It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways. I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed. Nope.I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house. Nope. There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not. They are not location aware in any way. The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording. Nope!The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours. Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room. I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on. This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%. This is with all the 'battery saving options' on. This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording. So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing. I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality. The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.***UPDATE***Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera. You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then. Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't. Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera. The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support. Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.***ANOTHER UPDATE***From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"". This will be a great update and should have been available on launch. I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.***ONE MORE UPDATE***Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days. It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration. With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set. They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away. For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off. You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc. Or any combination. The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can. This is a great improvement. They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5. This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras. I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.***LAST UPDATE***Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I've had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now. All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night. Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn't bad. I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it's pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation. They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you're thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them.","Before I start my revised review, let me state that there's been a lot of news lately about people hacking into Ring cameras, but this only happens when someone installs a new camera and doesn't update the default username and password (or has an extremely weak password which is easy for a hacker to guess). This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions.Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product.Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all.Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement.A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring.Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised.***UPDATE***Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices.Ring has now updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new wireless battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well.Observations.Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool.I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a few months before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent.I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once.Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete.I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic.Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.","Had the camera up and running in less than ten minutes. Excellent quality picture. Hooking up to the solar panel when installing, this way battery is always charged. Received mounting hardware, camera has been installed.",Installed 2 of these outside my house in about 20 minutes. Mounted one above my garage and the other near my front door. The video quality is pretty good. Not facial recognition software good but good enough for a good description of people if needed. I used the mounts that came will the camera and scanned the QR code for setup. Not sure why people couldn't set up zones. It is part of the setup unless you skip over the steps. I do agree with most reviews that the notifications are spotty. Took my trash out and the one by the garage only recorded me going to the side of the house and the one by the front door only recorded me coming back. A neighbor walked by this morning and it started recording after they walked by and were down the street. Pic attached. Went outside again and the both cameras picked me up as I would have expected. I will adjust the camera and reset the zones to see if that helps. They are my first Ring cameras so there may be fine tuning on my part that is needed. Will update this as the days go by.Windows 10 app logs me in but says I don't have any cameras set up. Tried on a PC and 2 laptops. Please fix!!Phone apps are pretty good so far. (Samsung note 9)Updating to 5 Stars.....After adjusting my zones and motion settings I was able to get the results I needed. At one point the wind blew leaves across my driveway and my sensor went off. After fine tuning I see no issues with the camera and its performance. It is by far better than other cameras I have purchase over the years and after comparing subscriptions from other companies $10 a month or $100 is a deal.,Don’t let any negative reviews influence your decision to buy these cameras. The negative reviews are from people who have not read the instructions or just have no idea how a security camera works. I monitor 16 security cameras where I work so I have a lot of experience with them. I bought the Ring Stick up camera and the solar charger for it as well. They both work great. I bought two more a week later. Now a month later I have no issues with battery power loss of any kind. Just set your zones to cover what you want. Don’t put motion sensor on full or you will catch bugs and falling leaves. I set my sensitivity in the middle. The image quality day and night is pretty good. You can also look at your cameras from a computer as well as your phone. You don’t need an Alexa to use these. The microphone works well too. Overall I would highly recommend these if you just read and understand the instructions and how they work which is very simple and easy.MD in SC 1-1-21,35984,1,https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Stick-Up-Cam-Battery/dp/B07Q3T177V/ref=sr_1_22_sspa?keywords=wifi+security+camera&qid=1640229461&sr=8-22-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzNTVKN1UxMFowQjFZJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzA0NzQ5T0NJTVAwUktVQzhDJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA5Mjg2MjBFUlBZU1k4MTI4VCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2J0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

During night, the spotlight is responsive and provides color night vision throughout my entire drive way. 2 way audio is also a great feature. The camera seems to be well weather sealed. Notifications are instant and it has so far a 100% person detection rate. There is a beta pet detection setting, which does not work for detecting cats in my experience - I do not know about larger pets. The camera worked great for a week or so and then started to behave weird: Every morning it remains stuck in a black and white mode, where it does not trigger any motion recordings and does not send any notifications. I just noticed it as I had people in the drive way, but did not get any notification. The video stream is still real-time, though - just in b/w. It happens sometimes during night and the only work around so far is to restart the camera. This happened now for several consecutive days. It is a camera issue, as I notice the same behavior on 2 iPhones and 2 iPads and none of my Indoor Cam 2k show this issue. Resetting is a strain, as I have to pull out a long ladder to get to the camera and to the reset button, which then requires to re-adjust the camera due to the magnetic mount, which would not be necessary with a fixed mount (this should really be provided in the box). There should also be a software option for resetting it rather than the physical button on the camera, where you also have to open the weather seal for the microSD card, which is not great when done on a frequent basis. I hope this will - and can be fixed soon. Right now it is completely useless for detecting intruders until, this is fixed. Therefore my generous 3 star rating, which I will have to drop to 1 star, if this cannot be fixed. Otherwise this is a solid 5 star device.UPDATE:Eufy technical support was very responsive replying within hours to my inquiry. They asked to send in video for analysis and within days shipped me a new camera for testing. However, this one had the same flaw and technical support pointed to a potential firmware issue and provided a new firmware 1.0.2.6 within 3 days! This one corrected this odd behavior and now the camera works perfectly. They even let me keep the original camera as well. I highly recommend this camera and should you require any technical help, the responsiveness of Eufy is just fantastic!",I recently bought the 2 wireless eufy cameras and they were absolutely horrible. The motion detectors would rarely detect and the battery hit 50% about 2 weeks after. I know Eufy's motion detection isn't bad because I have the indoor wired camera as well so I decided to try out the outdoor wired camera as well and no regrets.The camera detects human motion at a 100% rate!My only qualm is the way the way they manufactured the mount. It's magnetic and the cable is in the way to angle it the way I want..,"I've longed for a eufy outdoor camera that was an all-in-one unit to compete with the Arlo Pro 4 and this unit is it! The camera is packaged well and setup is easy. The fact that they include the micro SD card and that the unit works without a base station is genius. The camera works via your wifi and uses AI on the unit to process all data and transfer that to the user via the app. Eliminating the battery for an always plugged in and on system is perfect for those with outdoor outlets. The value for the price is spot on. I am very happy with this product. Anyone interested in easy outdoor security with 24/7 recording, ability to go back in time, and receive motion alerts and recordings, should seriously consider this product.",It was a breeze to set up. A lot of good features in the app. I didn't like that it only has one way of mounting via the magnetic mount. They should had a screw in version so it is more secure. It is overpriced for what you get. It isn't that expensive to get certification for the ip rating. It would probably be a good price around $69.99.Will update on the next weeks.,"The camera plugs into an outlet so there is none of the battery nonsense to fool with. The app works seamlessly and pulls both my Eufy doorbell and this camera up on the same screen. Notifications are quick, install was a breeze and it does a perfect job detecting motion.

But I absolutely had to share my experiences with Annke Tech Support as their level of assistance and patience and accommodation was nothing short of phenomenal. After initially emailing them, they evaluated my request and responded to me within 13 hours (time zone gap included) and said that Tech Support would reach out in 24 hours. They reached out in 2...just excellent. From there, they were extremely responsive to help me troubleshoot my issue and we emailed back and forth a few times. Eventually, THEY determined that email would not resolve the issue so we had a Remote Desktop Sharing session to efficiently find resolution. We lost connection at one point, and Tech Support even CALLED ME to make sure we were still able to proceed. About 30 minutes later, I'm all set and happily keeping their product. As I am sure many of you have experienced poor customer service at some point in your life, you can rest easy that this company cares about their product and customers. If a positive review on their customer service is not enough to convince you to buy....allow me to review their product.Summary  Customer Service is Unparalleled. Price is Excellent. Video Quality is Great. Setup is fairly straight-forward. Some improved/updated instructions would be beneficial, but manageable as is. Interface could be improved to enhance experience, but ok.I spent a decent amount of time reading product descriptions and reviews for Home Video Surveillance and simply could not find anything that matched the price or positive reviews. Sure, there are some eyebrow-raising comments in some of the reviews, but nothing truly concerning. Some folks are expecting too much out of Nightvision, in general. This system performs above its price point. Sure, there are $1,000+ systems out there that will outperform this product, but that's not what you are buying. This system is a great middle ground between buying one/two over-priced Nest or Ring cameras that are merely selling their name and buying a 'high-end' surveillance system, which is probably overkill for you home. If you really need a system like that, then you should probably consider moving to a better area. You are going to get enough product (8 cameras and a DVR and remote access) to satisfy almost everyone’s surveillance needs.The quick setup guide provided was fairly straight-forward. I was able to connect it to my Smartphone without issue, easy. Adding the SADP Tool to my networked laptop was a bit more effort. The link provided in the guide was not accurate / retired, so a quick search on Annke's website located the software then back to the guide to complete setup. Not the end of the world, just be patient. If you cannot find it, email them. My 'issue', which required Tech Support, was that remote connection via the Web was no longer supported, despite being included in the guide. While this was a bit deceiving and frustrating, Tech Support was able to find a work-around and use Port Forwarding to allow me the type of access I was interested in. Most people will probably not need this, but I prefer laptops over phones and tablets, so it was a deal-breaker for me if no resolution…plus I didn’t want to have to install the SADP Tool on all of my laptops (again, I may be abnormal as I have 4 laptops in my home, but just sharing my experiences). Thankfully, Annke was able to help.Other than that, just know that the SADP Tool, Web, and DVR (i.e. direct connection between DVR and Monitor) interfaces are not overly user-friendly, but with some tinkering, you get used to the buttons and how to use the system. Again, not that big of a deal when you consider what you are getting for the price.If you are debating between this product and a competitor, give Annke a shot knowing that they will take care of you if you need help.","Only had it up and running for a day but very happy with it.

The set up of the mini was FAR EASIER than the outside cams. I had this thing set up in less than 5 minutes. Picture is good. Sound is LOUD which is what I was looking for.The app however needs some work to support this style of camera. The app works decently for the BlinkXT cameras and functionality, which is motion for most users. As in you get a notification that there is motion, it records, and you watch the recording or live as you please. but it is clunky to get into the Blink Mini for the purpose of continuous viewing which is my intention for this camera, like a baby monitor. Like many other Americans now working from home with a full house of kids, I wanted to use this to assist with keeping an eye on the kids as I worked and record those cute moments. I wanted to use this to visualize a blind spot that I can’t see from the office. I tried mounting it from the ceiling and realized you can’t rotate the video. Mounting on the wall was a little problematic, I couldn’t quite get the right angle needed.Another quirk to the app is if you switch to another app and then come back to the Blink app, you have to hit the play button to resume viewing.All in all, these are minor issues specific to my use of the camera which is why I have it five stars anyway.Hey amazon/Blink, it would be an awesome feature if you’d allow the integration of this camera with Alexa so we can “drop in” and talk through the Echo Dot. Just saying.",I love this lil camera!! Easy to install! Only took 5 min and it works great!! Highly recommend this!!,Great price and product. Connected very easily to my existing Blink system. I am not happy with having to pay for storage after trial ends.,"This is a great little camera monitor. Pros: easy set up, easily managed with your smart phone, clear image quality with motion detection. Can be set up to arm and record at any time. I bought this to use in my master bedroom by my desk where I keep sensitive information.Cons: if you are using it with another Blink product and you arm 24/7 then the other Blink unit also needs to be armed which is an issue because my other unit uses 2 AA batteries. There is no timer on the app to set up a time to arm which would by useful because I sometimes forget to arm at night. It has good night vision quality. It needs to be plugged in so is a problem if you put it in a place (i.e. bedroom closet) if there is no outlet. Because of this, it is difficult to make the camera more hidden (if you are looking for a nanny camera for example).Overall it is easy to use and I would recommend it for a basic home security camera.","SO...I rarely write reviews but was so amazed by this camera I wanted to let others know. I bought the camera after using the Ring indoor camera for twice the price and it made a constant clicking noise with the filter adjustment to light in the room that was a known issue Ring told me and not a defect. I've tried all the other brands out there WYZE, etc and disappointed with all. Then I tried the Blink Mini which I thought was a good price. The setup was a breeze, up and running in 30 seconds.

With the new indoor cam I can now access all my cams from one app. To me the picture quality is great overall and especially in total darkness. Live view connection is a lot more stable than my Wyze cams. Alexa integration is a big plus, no need for third party hacks to complete routines. Because I already have Ring cameras it’s worth it to pay a little more over a Wyze cam.","In February, I noticed my ADHD medication ran out early. I’m very careful about taking it exactly as prescribed so it was strange that I had run out 10 days early. For reasons I won’t get into for this review, I suspected the property manager of my building was stealing it. Obviously that sounded crazy, but I couldn’t think of another explanation. A friend suggested a Ring camera, so I bought one never expecting anything to actually come of it. I put some antihistamines in my now empty pill bottle thinking no one would ever take them, set up the camera when it arrived, and felt more secure knowing it was there. Set up was simple so I figured worst case scenario, I was out a bit of money and I spent maybe 10 minutes setting it up.Fast forward a week later when I get a notification via the app that there was motion detected on my camera. I open up the recording and there she is, entering my apartment, going right for my decoy pills, taking them, and leaving. I immediately left work to get back home. I called the police who sent an officer. I showed him the video and he admitted that had I not had the video, he wouldn’t have believed me. I was able to quickly and easily send the video to the police and to the president of the company that owns my building. I also was able to download the video and get it uploaded so that I have copies of it as I go through the next few months as she (hopefully) gets brought to justice.I cannot emphasize how much this little camera has helped me. I would not have caught my burglar otherwise. Because of it, they were able to look up records of who used their electronic key to access my apartment and she had been in there 7 times over the month prior. This would have gone on for longer and who knows if it would have resulted in harm to myself or my cat had I not caught her. This camera has given some of the sense of security she stole from me back and stopped a nightmare situation from worsening. I will still be recovering from this for long time and I am hoping she is brought to justice, but I cannot thank Ring enough for helping me secure my home from an unexpected source of danger.","This camera for $60 is a solid deal.

Easy to Install!,A much improved camera.,"No DDNS option, but great customer support","Incredible Value, 5 STARS!",Update: Disappointing!☹️,"I have plenty of IP cameras in my house. They are a combination of DLink, Wansview, Tenvis etc. I have to say my most durable ones are from Wansview. I've had some for as long as 2010! They simply give you the best bang for your buck. I hate to say it but the reason ALL of these IP cameras have a low rating is because of one thing. User error. I admit, I have an IT background and installing these are really easy for me. The new cloud feature couldn't be more easier to install. Even my mom could do it, (sorry mom LOL). Just download the app, make an account, show the QR code that shows up on your app to the camera. Super easy.This new Q5 is my favorite along with my other Wansview cam (top photo). It is very compact (see bottom right photo). It also has a microUSB port for power (left pic). I hope this review has helped you.","My review is based on the experience of using several IP cameras from different vendors over the past 4 years.Overall, the Wansview Q5 Cloud Camera performs very well and the initial setup / install is super easy and quick. With some of my other cameras, I sometimes spent hours (even days) in setting them up. I like the Q5 new form-factor which is nicer and much smaller than the previous Q3 camera. It feels well-built and I expect it to last for many years. The phone software can use some bells and whistles available from other competing IP cameras. That said, it is very intuitive and easy-to-use. In summary, I would recommend this camera because of its well-built hardware, functionalities, and price. Below are some more details:Pros:+ Setting up the first time is quick (5 min for both software and hardware) with their easy-to-follow instructions.+ Camera hardware is well-built, good-looking, and small in size which I like.+ The wide-angle lens is the best I’ve seen in terms of clarity and coverage.+ Crisp & clear images and videos - day and night (see images attached).+ Excellent audio & mic (considering the small-size factor), definitely better than that on their Q3 and K3 cameras, and other cameras I’ve owned.+ The Wansview cloud android phone app is easy to set up, easy to use and to configure.+ Upon detecting motions, the camera sends me alerts on my phone, and 10-sec video clips in the mobile app. This a new feature. Nicely done Wansview!Cons:- No audio-detection alert capability (only motion-detection).- Viewing saved images, they don’t auto-rotate along with the phone’s rotating to a horizontal orientation (from a vertical orientation)- It would be nice if the phone app’s white background can be manually set to a darker theme like black.- It would be nice if the multi-camera screen can be set to load as default upon logging in. Currently it requires an extra click.","Gave this camera to my dad. Here is his review:""Just got this new Q5 IPCam to add to my other Wansview IPCameras. First thing I noticed was the ease of setup.A couple of items to note:- Setup and operation are ONLY with WiFi. Plugged in LAN is not an option.- Your phone and Q5 will have to be in same 2.4GHz connection frequency. Q5 will only connect to 2.4GHz and your phone may be on a 5GHz spectrum, not gonna work. If your home WiFi shows two separate SSID’s for each frequency then it should be easy enough for you. I’ve setup my WiFi router to use one SSID only for both frequencies, I had to go into my router setup and temporarily disable the 5GHz radio to force all devices I have to the lower frequency. I turned the 5GHz radio once the Q5 was completely setup.- Like the fact they’re finally using micro USB connector from DC supply to IPCam and not the old 3.5mm plug in type- The Q5 will not work with the previous Wansview IPCam App but instead you’ll need to download their new Wansview Cloud App which is fine as well.- Image sample looking from my home office window is not that bad. I’m sure I can clean it up some more later.- No DDNS support. Camera will only work using Wansview Cloud App. I use a third party IPCam viewer App to use on all my other IPCameras (Foscam, Amcrest and Wansview), no luck on this one or at least not yet. Hopefully they will upgrade it for future capability.- The new Wansview Cloud App still need some work to refine minor UI issues particularly on the chat section.- I’m not a big fan of IPCam paid cloud subscription regardless who the service provider is. I’ll continue using the memory card option on this camera. I could save all recording to my own cloud system if only DDNS is supported on these Q5 IPCamTechnical support either email or chat using the chat option on the App (even on Wechat!) was amazing. These guys are extremely helpful, particularly Simona!Will definitely order more again from them if only they can help on the DDNS option. Otherwise their customer support team’s ability is what pushed them to 5 stars.""",,"I like it! I don’t bother with the ‘Cloud Storage’ and just use the short videos! I turn the notifications off because there are too many with me moving around back and forth all the time. But I find it handy to check on my Cat while I’m out, and when I’m out of town I’ll turn the notifications back on while he’s at the pet sitters. Works for me!👍********************************************UPDATE: TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED!After a VERY short time, I discovered this camera obviously doesn’t work! I had a delivery person walk thru my home right in front of the camera, being in the kitchen talking for over a minute and walking back thru. It NEVER showed ANY motion at all!!! WOW! And here I thought I was going to have some security in this low income housing district I live in!

Cameras can be viewed at the base unit, on a computer app, or a mobile app. Mobile app works remotely - even over cellular data. Most features in the system can be configured from any of those places.Lots of things can be configured - sensitivity, detection zones, schedules, notification types (email, push, etc)The system includes all screws, mounting templates, CAT5e cable. It's ready to go. Nice looking cameras - my wife complains that they don't look menacing enough. lolI have couple minor quibbles.- They send ethernet cables, and waterproof caps for the ethernet cables, but to use them, you have to take the end off the cable and recrimp it.- The cable coming from the camera is split into the ethernet jack, a power jack, and a reset button. You can waterproof the ethernet, but not the rest. It's a lot of cable that has to be put somewhere. It won't fit into the camera base.- The base of the round camera is *almost* the same size as a round utility box used for ceiling fans. Almost. But it's not. The screw holes don't line up.- The camera is in a ball, there's a socket/cover that goes over it. Unfortunately, in some orientations, the microphone hole is covered by the socket.","After a few vehicles break ins recently we decided to invest in a video system. We researched many units and decided on the Reolink.The kit came in packaged nice and tight so the pieces were not rattling around. The system came with four network cables, and two of them were shorter than necessary runs we needed. So we opted to run our own network cables and tip them to network standard 568B. After running all cables we mounted the dome cameras, and installation was easy. We followed the instructions and used the mounting templates and all cables are hidden in the eaves so the mount looks very clean.We installed the application on both our phones and our computers with no problems, and after creating our accounts we were in business. I suggest you play with the options so you can curtail the recording features to your liking.The picture quality at both day and night are clear and pictures can be zoomed in through the app to capture a specific image within the frame. The play back video is broken down into segments so you can search specific times without viewing the entire recording to find your subject. It’s been a month since installed it and we are extremely satisfied with the Reolink.Pros:Network cables are made for you.Easy to install cameras.Clean looking finished product and network cables are hidden.Easy to program.Application is easy to navigate.Crisp video and pictures.Time frame blocks for easier research.Cons:The network cables maybe too short so you might have to run and tip your own cables, unless you find a central location in your house to place the unit.There is an annoying beeping sound that goes off when the camera picks up motion. This drove us crazy and we had to contact Reolink on how to turn it off. You have to navigate to that field on every camera to disable the beep.",384,85,https://www.amazon.com/Surveillance-Supported-Security-Recording-RLK8-420D4/dp/B077SYSQFQ/ref=sxin_14_ac_d_bv?ac_md=6-3-QWJvdmUgJDMwMA%3D%3D-ac_d_bv_bv_bv&cv_ct_cx=wired+security+cameras&keywords=wired+security+cameras&pd_rd_i=B077SYSQFQ&pd_rd_r=c086aa2e-c3f8-4ea4-9211-3260ff8ce898&pd_rd_w=kqpEq&pd_rd_wg=OB8ho&pf_rd_p=148e9898-1bed-4a70-9840-46f32e4185bd&pf_rd_r=Z8JEW1MTC8ETRQERBCV0&psc=1&qid=1640229779&smid=A22EYB2OIILVQA&sr=1-4-f4ff053e-b1e8-4d31-8f95-56d755c862ba

A couple of cameras closest to the NVR are on a home run. Those cameras connect to two of the PoE jacks in the back of the NVR and the rest come in on a single LAN jack, which includes the one WiFi camera. It works great.There is almost no documentation included with the products so I went to the Reolink website. It's unbelievably bad...as if it's been written with Google translate. The system is pretty much plug-and-play, but if you run into any issues you're kind of on your own to figure it out. Suggestion for Reolink: You've created a nice product; spend a few bucks and hire an English-speaking editor to clean up your website. Example: One of your staff contributors said sharing cameras via a switch is a great solution-- another said it's not recommended for more than two cameras. I've got six cameras coming in on one switch at full resolution and they look great.I've revised my original four-star review to five stars because the equipment is so good and everything works well once it's set up properly.",,"Bought the Reolink 16 channel NVR and its pretty much a plug and play operation. The night vision is more clear than I expected and the daytime 5MP is a very sharp imageMy NVR worked flawlessly for 6 months, then I had a problem cause it wouldn't boot up properly. I was very skeptical cause the only way to contact Customer service is through ""e-mail only"" So I had very little expectation of getting any help..... But they always responded promptly and there was messages from them the next morning when I checked. After a couple of messages............... They 100% resolved my problems to my full satisfaction.When I expand my security system at my warehouses .For sure Ill purchase Reolink equipment again.............. Its good equipment but what really stands out to me is the ""excellent customer service"" and their desire to solve my issues (even though the contact is thru email) Its a reliable company and based on my experience I would recommend them 100%As a result of the cameras I was able to catch two men in the act of breaking and entering and stealing. and what satisfaction !!!","We've now had this system on our business for 2 years. Never have we had a problem with any portion of this system... it's quite actually been a plug & play operation for us. The install was the toughest job, and only then because we were building our own cables to accommodate exterior applications (UV/buriable outdoor cable) and very long/difficult cable pulls between stories and rooms of our building. Our cameras have now experienced two very cold winters in snow and ice, but most commonly see rain (in OR. state) with a few short months of good sunshine. They have all worked flawlessly. No complaints. The night vision is quite impressive on even just the RLC410 units. We've also got an RLC423, RLC511, and a few others. Each camera has performed admirably. All thumbs up to the folks at Reolink for producing such an affordable product that is also incredibly well built and versatile.My only ONLY grip is that when/if you wish to speak to a customer support person on the phone and ask direct questions in real time... there doesn't seem to be a way to pull that off. Instead its a string of email Q&A with their support staff that can drag on for days to answer one otherwise simple question.On the plus side... their staff is very helpful, though it's clear that English isn't their native tongue. Some of the replies are kinda cryptic and some of my questions need to be asked in another fashion, in order to be addressed. But I'm not hating. Just wishing I could actually speak to some guy named chuck that sounds just like I do.","The easiest software I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I have installed several systems from different manufacturers. I won't get into the name dropping here but from a system installer perspective, Reolink has very solid and easy to follow software. The hardware is just as impressive. I installed 12 cameras at my house without any issues. The attached picture really does not show the amount of detail these cameras display. The attached picture is a screenshot from my phone. I have had them up and running for 2-weeks now with no problems. As others have mentioned the motion detection is somewhat sensitive, but I would prefer this to be the case. The night viewing is impressive with great black and white clarity. The phone app (Android for me) is just as well thought out as the NVR software. I would not have any problem recommending Reolink to anyone that needs a IP camera system.",892,191,https://www.amazon.com/Reolink-Security-Outdoor-Recording-RLK16-410B8-5MP/dp/B01B4BKJK4/ref=sxin_13_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?cv_ct_cx=wired+security+cameras&keywords=wired+security+cameras&pd_rd_i=B01B4BKJK4&pd_rd_r=c086aa2e-c3f8-4ea4-9211-3260ff8ce898&pd_rd_w=4KNid&pd_rd_wg=OB8ho&pf_rd_p=4ad71b32-b810-4124-8735-d02a39478d0c&pf_rd_r=Z8JEW1MTC8ETRQERBCV0&qid=1640229779&sr=1-5-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzT1A0ODI2REk3VjBKJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjY2MjI3MUFOTUZUWTRZMk85QyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzcxMDk2RUxDQ1VIRzdGOVAyJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3Bfc2VhcmNoX3RoZW1hdGljJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

Great night vision. I went with hardwired cameras due to their lack of vulnerability to cyber threats. However, the DVR does have an ethernet connection and there is an app you can use to monitor the system. I will continue exploring the cyber vulnerabilities of this system to ensure it does not sell info or footage to a third party. The only gripe I have is that the motion detection is pretty touchy, even at the lowest sensitivity level. One bug flying in front of it and I'll get a notice. I also noticed that if a car drives fast enough in front of my residence, I still get a motion detection notice even though I have removed that area from my camera's detection grid. For the money, I can't complain. Better than paying ADT $40/month to tell me my dog tripped the alarm. Be prepared for a hard day in the attic or crawl space to install, that's the price you pay for hardwired systems.","Our peaceful safe neighborhood has recently become a target for crime. Houses and cars have been broken into almost daily. So we decided to purchase a security system before we were hit. This was our 1st ever security camera purchase. I did not know anything about how to pick one so I did a lot of research and eventually decided on this one. We got the 8camera and 500gb hard drive.It arrived fast and great packaging.Hookup was a bit challenging and time consuming (maybe because this was our 1st) but took a while to get the cords ran. So patience is a plus for all brands I would assume not just this one. But soon that time consuming part was worth it. The picture is crystal clear even in pitch dark. We. Couldn't believe how good it was in night vision. Daytime is just as clear. We have it hooked up to a computer screen that was not being used and its perfect. We have recommended it to everyone . great system, crystal clear pictures and good customer service.Luckily,we have not caught anyone trying to break in our stuff that we have worked hard for many years to get. But if we do we will be ready.Although we have not caught burglars we have caught wildlife on camera. We live in the country/woods type of area and have seen our daily visit from our neighborhood bear as well as raccoon and opposums. I am attaching a pic of the night vision and one of our bear sightings. We only have up 5 of the cameras right now. The pictures are pictures of the screen with my phone but still pretty good quality.","Better than expected! Received it on 5-17-17 hooked it up and the clarity is more than I need. Also love the night vision , also very clear. Was Leary because of the price point but after reading a majority of the feed back I purchased it. Glad I did!","Absolutely worth the money. I’ve had a different swann system and that hard drive fried after one singular storm... this system has gone through several power surges, storms, and a tornado. It’s still kicking. I was able to use those 4 swann cameras with this device for a total of 8, just waiting to find the perfect spot for the last camera. It’s perfect. Easy to set up and use. The app was also easy to set up. Downside is that every time the internet or power goes out you have to reconnect the system to the app, but it is what it is. Not a big deal. I did give the night vision a 4 star because I wish it was just a tad bit clearer. The app has a feature that you can take screen shots and videos of recordings. You can go back almost two weeks. The zoom is incredible. Overall, I’d recommend this to everyone.","I recently got this set-up after attempting a cheaper IP wireless camera. For my needs, the IP camera was a wash and difficult to set up and use. I decided to bite the bullet and spend a little more for this system. I do not regret it one bit! The set up is relatively easy, although wires are almost always a pain. After testing the system, I installed 3 of the 4 cameras. The included cables are more than generous in length. Although the cameras are waterproof, the connections are not, so for the one camera that isn't under the roof line, I did have to get some marine quality heat shrink wrap and a heat gun. All in all, once installed, the system is a breeze to set up. As it has a built in hard drive, it's so much easier than getting a cheaper system that requires an additional hard drive. I like that I can see, playback, and even record segments from my phone. In addition, the included DVR is easy to use and maneuver through. This is the 1st security system I ever installed, and I now feel like an expert after doing this myself. I would absolutely recommend this system, and I've actually already convinced a few neighbors to get the same system.

Installation and setup are quick and easy, and the image quality is crisp and sharp day or night. But it's the outstanding phone and tablet apps that separate this system from the rest of the field. Reolink clearly put a lot of thought into app functionality, and it pays off.Long Version:This was actually the second 5MP security system I bought to replace my aging Q-See 720P system. Unfortunately, the first system I bought (ZOSI) was crippled by a really poor phone app. Since I usually live-view or playback when I'm away from home, the app is a crucial component. After returning the ZOSI system, I did a lot more homework, including watching a number of YouTube videos. The Reolink app looked to have the best functionality and ease of use, so that's the system I chose.Installation was straightforward. This is a PoE (Power over Ethernet) system, so I used my existing BNC cables to pull the new CAT5 cables. I made up a plywood drill guide to accurately drill the screw and cable holes in my soffits. This is one improvement I could suggest: I wish Reolink would provide a molded plastic drill template, as this would make camera mounting easier. With the cameras installed and the CAT5 cables in place, all that's left is to hook up the NVR. Initial programming could hardly be easier - far more user-friendly than my old Q-See system.Last step was installing the apps on my phone and tablet, and this too was a snap, with a QR scan taking care of most of the process. There's also a Windows client that lets me view and control the system from my laptop.The phone app is excellent. On opening the app, it automatically goes to your most recent view. This is great, as I most often check the camera at my front door to look for packages when I'm away, or to see who's at the door before deciding whether to answer. To save bandwidth, the phone app view is medium-res, but there's a cool feature called ""Clip"" that gives you a high-res closeup you can drag and zoom around the overall view. Rotate your phone, and the view instantly switches to full-screen.The playback feature is also excellent. It's quick and easy to navigate to the time period you want to replay. Simply tap the date and then select the time block (the recordings are saved in roughly 1-hour blocks). Drag the slider to find the exact period you want to replay, then tap the camera icon for a still photo or the movie icon to start recording video. I do wish there was a 30 second skip forward/back option, as this would make finding the exact moment of interest a little easier. Photos and videos are saved to local storage, but you can also set up a cloud account and have them upload automatically.The app also supports remote control PTZ (pan/tilt/zoom) cameras if you decide to add one or more to your system. The system comes with 4 cameras, but the NVR supports up to 8, so you have room to upgrade.The system also supports push alerts to your phone. You can choose which cameras to send alerts and choose the portions of their fields of view to ignore so as to reduce false alarms. The motion detection is very sensitive, so I'd recommend selecting only the key ares, like your front steps and mailbox lid. Alerts are almost instantaneous.Finally some comments on the Windows Client: This too is a useful tool, as when working from home I can keep it running in the background and quickly see who's at the door. Because my laptop is on the same router as the NVR, live view is much sharper than on my phone. The client also supports closeup ""Clips"" for getting a sharper view of some object of interest.I would add that Reolink's website is excellent, with regularly updated setup how-tos and support FAQs, and their tech support staff are fast and efficient in replying to questions.All in all, this security system has met or exceeded nearly all my wishes and expectations.","I've spent months trying to decide on a replacement camera system for my house to replace a 5 year old Zmodo coax system. Whilst the Zmodo has proven reliable, the system has many shortcomings and annoyances which I’ve taken into consideration when choosing a new system. If you are like me and research everything to death before making a decision you'll know that sometimes trying to balance all the good reviews vs the bad ones can leave you more messed up and confused than when you started. So for people wanting to know the pro's and con's of this system I have shared some of my own observations below and I hope they will help you in making informed and educated decisions on your own future system.Likes:- The supplied camera's are 4MP and have built in Microphones. They are POE and only require an Ethernet cable from the NVR to each camera. The audio is also transmitted through the Ethernet cable so no additional cables needed for audio. The cables supplied are 59ft long, if you need longer cables and plan to make your own, the cabling pinout is standard Ethernet wiring - same as any patch cord.- The NVR will record all 8 camera's at 4MP at 30fps, all with audio too. I should warn that this recording method will consume a tremendous amount of HDD space. The 2TB drive in the NVR will begin looping after about 4 days but from what I understand the system is capable of both larger capacity HDD and will support an external E-SATA in tandem.- The NVR's software is very well thought out and easy to navigate. You will initially need a TV or a monitor with an HDMI or VGA to setup a few basic parameters like camera names, network settings etc.. but a wizard guides you through all this and makes it super easy. Once connected to the internet, you can download the Reolink app to your phone and to your desktop mac/pc. If your desktop/phone are connected to the same home network that the NVR is plugged into, the system will automatically be found and will configure itself for live viewing. If for whatever reason this doesn't work you can scan a QR code on the NVR lid. Once you have setup remote access you can unplug your monitor/tv, every setting that you might want to change on the NVR can be done on your phone or desktop.- You do not need to port forward any ports on your router. You can close them all and it will not effect remote capabilities.- The live audio will stream to mobile devices, meaning that whenever you are viewing a particular camera on your phone or desktop, you can hear the live audio.- This feature is what makes this system perfect to me. Like many other camera systems, this system has motion detection and will snap a picture and send it via email. The problem i've found with most systems (Particularly at night) is the number of false alarm events, whenever a fly buzzes by or high humidity, this in turn causes you to be getting emails all night long and in my case waking up to 700 emails, not knowing if any were important without going through all of them. This system however has 4 sensitivity settings that allow you to configure sensitivity based on blocks of time. so for example, between 6am and 12pm you can set a desired sensitivity level, from 12pm to 6pm another.. etc.. the sensitivity scale ranges from 1 to 50 with 1 being the most sensitive and 50 the lowest. It does take a few days to get the sensitivity just right but once you've figured it out you can virtually eliminate all false motion alerts. I have mine set at 25 through the daylight hours and 35 at night, since doing so I get no false alarms from insects or car lights and only pictures and emails when someone is actually there. The motion alert feature supports PUSH notifications in addition to the email alerts.- The phone app and desktop app are very well designed. The app for the phone can be configured with a pin/password lock as an extra security measure.- The bullet camera's have amazing night vision without any IR glare. I've had several dome camera's where the IR glare made the image cloudy and hard to see.Dislikes:- This is really only a minor complaint. I cannot find a way to make it easier to pinpoint motion events on the scrollable time scale during playback. My older Zmodo used to flag a motion event on the time bar irrespective of whether the system was setup to record continuously or motion record. I can just simply look at my phone and note the motion event date and time and then search the time bar to that specific time, I guess it would be nice if it placed a marker indicating an event.- The NVR has a small fan for evacuating heat from inside the case. This little fan is quite noisy and very noticeable if you had an older DVR that had no fan. I have ordered a NOCTUA fan to replace it with to see if it makes a difference.Conclusion:I am very picky when it comes to buying expensive electronic goods. I understand the value of laying out money for decent equipment, particularly when it's something to protect my home and my family. Looking for camera systems can be a pain and wading through the offerings to see which ones are legit and work well can be very frustrating. I took a shot in the dark when I ordered this Reolink system and I can say with certainty that not only did it meet my very stringent requirements, it exceeded them. I might add that I was so pleased with it that I ordered 4 more bullet cams to bring the total to 8.A bit of a long winded review but hopefully it will help people who are still on the fence about buying this system!","Here is my review.System is Ok, not a big deal.I thought 4MP camera makes a big difference but I was kind of wrong.Setup was easy.Day vision good.Night vision ok. If plants or trees nearby then you see nothing beyond that..In my case it's about 15 feet for night vision.. Night vision is good if there is nothing in front of your camera.Computer App is okPhone App does not disable power/screen saver. While you are watching the app, the phone goes to power/screen saver mode in few secondsif you don't touch the screen every few seconds.Price good but if I knew I would purchase US brand system so I can get the support if I needed.System already setup and running so I am too lazy to disconnect, pack and send it back.If you don't care for technical support then go for it.I will update my post again if I get a respond from they support.Update: The support team answered my email the next day. They are helpful.Update 6/22/16> very responsive technical support (Via email) They really follow up on the issue when you contact them.",,"I am that guy who does more research than most on big purchases with no exception here. My brother-in-law purchased a camera system of a “big” name brand company. I helped him install it and it was super easy especially given that it was a POE system. That is when I decided that I wanted a POE camera system. After reading reviews and watching videos I found this Reolink system to be the best for what I was looking for. My big threes were; Atleast 1080p, 100ft night vision and POE. This camera ticks all of those and some! Over 1080p, POE and sort of 100ft night vision. Any camera system you read reviews on no matter the brand never really hits the 100ft night vision mark. I would assume in perfect conditions you could get the 100ft. I can see at night probably 50ft clearly and 75ft or so max. Maybe in a scenario where there is no reflective surfaces or any lights to wash out the night vision you could see the 100ft. Anywho, the clarity on these cameras is amazing and the setup was easy. You literally plug and play. Once everything is hooked up, you download the app and scan the QR code on the NVR and bam! I can’t express how happy I am with this system.

A coworker told me about it and said they loved it. I looked online and started to look at the base model to save money. After doing hours on hours of research I found out that you can not buy a camera system on a budget. Once I came to that conclusion I went big. I started watching YouTube videos on different types of camera quality like 1080p-light. Its a joke don't buy that. Its less then 720p at 4fps. But I'm not going to get into all that. The 8-4k camera setup is perfect for my property. The cameras have a much wider angle the i anticipated and therefore only needed two in the actual house. The living room and kitchen. I did finally place one in the pantry to catch my teenager from eating all the junk food. Over all the install and set up are pretty easy. I do recommend printing out the 85 page full system user guide for the tips and tricks on picking the location of each camera. I have two that I need to move a few inches due to the inferred reflecting off the eves and washing out the night vision. And the 60 foot cables were plenty long enough to go from the center on my home and out to the edges. I went into the wall and up to the attic and out. One mistake I made was running the cables before attaching them to the camera first. This created two problems. The first: I could reach the cameras that were under the eves on the out side of the house from the very short attic. The second: I ran 6 of the 8 cables the wrong direction. A simple tip, connect the cables to the cameras and fish them in the attic and use a loge pole with a hook at the end to aid in retrieval. A few other problems I had had nothing going to do with product it self. Just not knowing how to do this and not having adequate help was a stresser. For the hub, its about the size of a large Blu-ray player and it is a bit loud. It won't interfere with day to day life but in a quiet room you will notice the hum. The Program: it is at first complicated. So much to see and click on and so many options for your unique situation. Again, I can't stress enough to read the full user manual before you start anything. And a few more things to say before I'm done. The App is good. I wish that I could do a few more system adjustments with the app but for the most part I like it. I can see the live feed just fine and see recordings when ever I need to. The app only plays back recordings in a lower video quality. And the pest part for me is being able to see all 8 cameras at once on 60in TV in 4k quality. Its almost better then actually going outside to see my yard. The photos are screen shots from the app on my phone. I am very pleased with this perches and definitely will recommend it.",Exceptional product. Keep in mind when buying there are two night vision options. This one gives clear picture with red LEDs. The other only senses heat. Some think they will see full night vision with heat sensing. It won’t.,"This was an upgrade from my older Swann system. An upgrade it has been. The views, both day and night are impressive. While I have not yet explored everything it can do, I am well satisfied that it will fill my needs. Based on how I use it, I decided to upgrade to a 6TB hard drive. I'd buy this system again in a heartbeat.",We upgraded from an earlier set of cameras. Definitely worth it.,250,20,https://www.amazon.com/Swann-Security-Surveillance-DVR-5580-SWDVK-855808WL/dp/B07X4BBTJV/ref=sr_1_22_sspa?keywords=wired+security+cameras&qid=1640229779&sr=8-22-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzT1A0ODI2REk3VjBKJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzM2OTQwMUdHUlM0R0ZSR0g5NSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjU0NTU4MlQxVVMzS05ESk5YRyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2J0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=

I hope this to be more durable than the last 3.Set up was a breeze, although instructions were practically non-existent. You can download the Arlo app and set up an account before you get the camera.Small glitch after installing, the app walks you through some steps and finally shows you a QR code on your phone that you hold up to the camera lens. The camera didn't seem to be working so I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it came on and scanned the code (I have mine wired to eliminate charging the battery). When I first put the battery in, it came on. But by the time I mounted it outside and started the ""install"" process, I had to reboot it.Super easy to connect to Google Home if you have a Google display. If not, it will still connect but you can't really do anything with it using google voice commands. It really works with the Google Nest Hub display or the Amazon Show, so you can use a command to see what's going on outside.The picture is very clear. It is not in color at night unless you go to the app and tap on the flashlight icon, then it shows in color. Not sure the purpose of that.You can enlarge what you see by pinching the screen. Shows the view in either horizontal or vertical orientation. I was surprised at the price that it's only 160° instead of 180° like some other cameras in this price range. But it is still a nice wide view.To use it outside, I recommend ordering the exterior mounting bracket (not included) otherwise a crook can just reach up and pull the camera off the included base as it attaches via a magnet.So far, I am very pleased with the ease of installation and use of the camera.

But the features I enjoy the most are the automatic ""Zoom"" in feature that can set the focus on a person that's in your zoned in area while it's recording and the very clear pictures at night. I did purchase the Arlo Accessory - Outdoor Magnetic Charging Cable | 25 ft, Weather Resistant Connector also as this works better for my personnel needs. We also have 6 other Arlo camera's, the Arlo Pro 2, Arlo Pro 3, the Arlo Audio Doorbell, Arlo Q and Arlo Baby we've been extremely happy over the last three years and yes we have a strong Wi-Fi connection.","I’ve had an Arlo Q+ inside my house for a couple of years and it has worked flawlessly. Decided to add the Pro 3 floodlight camera above our garage to replace an older ‘failed’ wired camera. The camera was easy to install and pair to our home’s wifi (I have multiple routers to cover the house). It did require I purchase the Arlo SmartHub base station; a device our Arlo Q+ did not need. The video is excellent, although on the default ‘motion detect’ setting it reacts too much to foliage blowing in the wind. Currently experimenting with the sensitivity settings. I will follow-up with an update if issues develop, but I am seriously considering adding additional Arlo cameras.","bought this to add to my Arlo system and not disappointed. It is really bright and I have a huge backyard. It does a great job of illuminating most of it. It also captures sound and motion like a champ. I’ve got a lot of critters that come and go so it will be nice to see if the camera can capture their activity. Also, it’s a great deterrent to keep the largest pests away. Set up was a little tricky given our Xfinity network not displaying 2.4ghz network name, but got that to work out by isolating that network separately. Otherwise, it was a smooth install.","This Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight camera is the best out there. I was doing a lot of research for a good floodlight camera and this one has topped all others. Pricing is respectable for everything this camera does. The zoom quality is amazing, the floodlight is very bright and motion sensors are great. To top it all off I am able to talk through and have an alarm sound. A countless sensor triggers and a good amount of floodlight use and the battery is at 70% after a weeks use. Very easy to install and even easier to remove to charge.","this is by far the best camera for my patio. I live in a high crime rate area and am constantly worried about my stuff being stolen, the Arlo Floodlight has put me at ease and i feel 10x more comfortable leaving my patio decor out. the motion detection is surprisingly great and the night vision is awesome and is very clear. tech support was very helpful and helped me throughout the process and catches everything i like that it blends in with my patio and is hard to see but also has a very strong light and you can see very clearly. highly recommended",3262,1,https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Floodlight-Wire-Free-6-Month-Activated/dp/B084TTKWHM/ref=sxin_14?asc_contentid=amzn1.osa.18c8e95b-b453-4406-89d3-7d57d962809e.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&asc_contenttype=article&ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.18c8e95b-b453-4406-89d3-7d57d962809e.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B084TTKWHM&cv_ct_cx=wireless+home+security+cameras&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.18c8e95b-b453-4406-89d3-7d57d962809e.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_we=asin&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source-earns-comm&keywords=wireless+home+security+cameras&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B084TTKWHM&pd_rd_r=13c2000f-f9e1-4e24-9f53-0f52e90717d0&pd_rd_w=3otPs&pd_rd_wg=oBy7M&pf_rd_p=b029c82c-aced-48fe-b955-08794dc4e3cd&pf_rd_r=97WD42X9PWK1501TTPRW&qid=1640229985&sr=1-2-a3cc9a7a-2f07-46dc-8259-ac02200376a0&tag=cnet-osp-20

Easy and quick setup, paired with the Arlo Chime and it is a great addition to my camera system. Only wish there was a way to turn off the phone calling but keep on the chime, so when I'm home it doesn't call my cell phone when someone rings the doorbell.","I put a ring and an Arlo next to each other. The Arlo out performed the Ring by a long shot. I especially like seeing animals at our rural home in Colorado and our home in Arizona. Animals come at night. Arlo picked up ten times the amount of bears, deer, elk, coyote, bobcat, Javelina as the ring set right next to it. That helped me decide to go with Arlo all the way.","I waited for Arlo to offer a wireless option to add to my fantastic Arlo wireless camera system. Pros- Super easy installation and the video feature is much more responsive than The Ring doorbell I replaced. Cons-you need to buy a separate chime if you don’t connect it with your old doorbell system, Arlo doesn’t yet offer a separate battery replacement. Although the included battery has only used 7% in 1 week. I like to have a back-up battery for all cameras so the system is fully operational when charging any batteries. Overall, I highly recommend this doorbell.","One of the biggest issues with many doorbell systems (ahem, Ring, et al) is privacy. Many systems by default allow the extension of your wireless network out to the sidewalk and allows other users to access it. Amazon claims they can only access the internet (something like the sidewalk program) but as a network security professional, I can tell you there are major security concerns with this, to include easy access/hacking opportunities for those with malicious intent and identity thieves.Network Security- As a security professional, I’d never allow a weak link like this to exist. Arlo does not have privacy concerns or “doors” like others do. As long as your wireless network is secure, your doorbell is secure.Quality- The Arlo system video is extremely clear, you can set the record/motion zones within the frame of the picture, sensitivities, and the detection system knows if it’s an animal/person/car by using algorithms. The video call is clear and I can easily hear the individual who is speaking at the door. I love to be able to interact with folks at the door while away from the house.Power- The battery lasts 3 months easily, and recharging only takes a couple hours. Of course you can buy a second battery and have it ready, but I didn’t bother. You also have the option to hard wire it to your existing 12 v doorbell system.Compatibility- I like how the system incorporates itself with my existing arlo cameras, yet it keeps itself separate. They can work together or independently or both.Addons- you can purchase a solar recharge system, extra rechargeable battery, and a physical wireless doorbell ringer to plug into an outlet.Provided in box- unit, 1 battery, connection kit for hard wiring, optional angle/corner bracket.I highly recommend this video doorbell.",I had been waiting for a wire-free doorbell from Arlo and I’m impressed with the device! Super easy to install and doesn’t require an Arlo Hub! Nice! All I needed was a few minutes to remove the Ring Scambell 2 and upgrade to the new Arlo doorbell. The battery takes a little while to charge - which I don’t understand why Arlo doesn’t support faster charging - but that’s not a huge deal. I charged the battery before setting up the doorbell in software. 5 minutes later I was up and running!,2022,581,https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-AVD2001-100NAS-Essential-Doorbell-Wire-Free/dp/B08HRNG8CR/ref=sxin_14?asc_contentid=amzn1.osa.18c8e95b-b453-4406-89d3-7d57d962809e.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&asc_contenttype=article&ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.18c8e95b-b453-4406-89d3-7d57d962809e.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B08HRNG8CR&cv_ct_cx=wireless+home+security+cameras&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.18c8e95b-b453-4406-89d3-7d57d962809e.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_we=asin&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source-earns-comm&keywords=wireless+home+security+cameras&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B08HRNG8CR&pd_rd_r=13c2000f-f9e1-4e24-9f53-0f52e90717d0&pd_rd_w=3otPs&pd_rd_wg=oBy7M&pf_rd_p=b029c82c-aced-48fe-b955-08794dc4e3cd&pf_rd_r=97WD42X9PWK1501TTPRW&qid=1640229985&sr=1-3-a3cc9a7a-2f07-46dc-8259-ac02200376a0&tag=cnet-osp-20

Buyer Should Have Serious Doubts About Buying From Reolink,This is impressive (bought a second),The best camera we've bought so far and we have several different brands !,Quality camera!,A nice Solar PT cam with excellent push alerts,"Leaving five stars because most people only look at the great reviews...so here is a more rounded review that should give everyone pause before they buy.Let me start by saying that I love the cameras. Bought 4 here and 3 more directly from Reolink on their Ebay store. The cameras have great picture quality and if you follow the instructions for setup using the bar codes, it takes about 45 seconds to get them up and running.And I am returning all of them. Further, I would strongly encourage all prospective buyers to strongly consider looking elsewhere for their security camera needs. Reolink is simply INEPT when it comes to backing up their products.A couple of weeks ago I bought 4 of these cameras. At $150 a camera with the solar panel, they are not cheap. As instructed during the setup of one of them, I went to lift up the little 1/2 inch by 3/8 rubber flap that covers the on/off switch and secures it from rain. The flap is held to the camera with a paper clip thick protrusion that goes into the body of the camera. When I pulled at it, that extremely thin piece of rubber holding the flap to the camera, broke. I didn't pull it hard, and I do not have super human strength. It just sort of broke and although I can still place the flap into the camera, it needs to be repaired because if it ever falls off, the entire camera will be ruined.I didn't think this was a big deal.I was wrong.I wrote to the company and explained the situation. I explained that the cover tore and I wanted to know how I could get a replacement cover. I would be happy to cover the costs. No problem. And I made it clear that I only needed the little cover because the camera otherwise worked fine. I just need the cover!Their response was that they wanted me to send them a picture of the camera. Admittedly, I was irritated. So I wrote back that I was surprised that they wanted a picture of this because the camera worked....I just needed the small cover and that I could probably buy it on ebay for a few cents plus shipping. This thing seemed like a no-brainer to me.They wrote back and said...oh, now that we understand that the camera works they will refer it to their techs.Great.Next day (and keep in mind that their turnaround is always a day later) I get an email asking me to send them a copy of the invoice. No problem. I did that within a minute.Next day..we enter the Twilight Zone. Instead of simply writing back to me with something saying that they are shipping out the new cover, I get an email asking me to send them the link of the Ebay listing for the cover I found so that they can tell me if it will fit the camera. HUH? So they have gone from taking responsibility for making a cheaply connected cover to helping me ensure that a third party solution (that did not exist) would fit their camera? This was sort of nutso.I wrote back and said simply that I did not find a cover on ebay.This morning - another 24 hours later - comes the latest response...they want to give me a 5 dollar refund.Now you would expect that a company selling a 150 dollar camera with a rubber cover for the on/off switch would grasp that the cover that they designed for their own camera to protect the switch from rain/snow/etc had an actual purpose for existing...but these folks instead want to refund me five bucks to accomplish what exactly? Am I supposed to tape the five dollar bill over the switch to protect it? I just need a new tiny cover!So I am now a week into this silliness and I have had enough. These cameras are not cheap. So before you buy from these folks, think very seriously about the warranty and support that they give and ask yourself if you should be going for products made by Google or Netgear because there is no doubt that a similar situation with their products would have resulted in a replacement part coming in roughly 2 days.Reolink makes great cameras. But they simply have no ability to back up their products with support that should make people comfortable. I have lost confidence in this company.All of my cameras...a thousand dollars of cameras...are going back because they can't figure out how to send out a tiny rubber cover that cost them a few cents.Pathetic.","My camera just showed up today. Ive been messing with it all day. I hooked up the solar panel and even on a cloudy day in the shade, it still charged a bit. Picture quality is clean 1080. Functionality is very responsive. Night vision is strong and clear. I can also listen with the built in mic and even that is crystal clear. I am very happy with this camera so far. Battery life seems to be pretty great. Its battery only loses about 10% over night and stays at 100% every day it. Very impressive and easy to install. I think i will add more in the future. Motion detection works great. Was a bit sensitive at first, but after tinkering with the settings in the app, i got it to ignore traffic and sense people. Highly recommended.","This is Karen's husband writing this review as I am the ""tech guy"" in our home.I am VERY pleased with how the camera is performing so far, so the 4.2 out of 5 rating seems well deserved. I admit I had some reservations when I read some of the reviews that were negative, in my opinion some may have been because of an individually defective product and some may have been due to lack of detailed enough directions.When I was first trying to connect the camera to our WIFI it wouldn't connect, then I realized I forgot to type in our WIFI password, DUH ! After I added the password it connected immediately. The camera is roughly about 85 feet from our WIFI router and goes thru 2 walls and still has kept connected very well.Also, we have Amazon Alexa and at first could not get Alexa to recognize the camera, so I did an online search for help and found a page on the Reolink support site with the steps needed to connect to Alexa, after reading that page I saw there was a step I didn't know about, once I followed those steps Alexa connected very well ! We can view the live camera feed from our smartphone app, from our ""Echo Shows"" via voice command, and even on our tv screens with Amazon Firestick (we have other brands of security cameras we view thru the Firestick also) so I can use a voice command and see different cameras on the screens including the Reolink camera, and I did not have to download anything to the Firestick, simply enable Alexa according to the directions on the help page I mentioned.I already had security cameras looking from our home outward, I wanted a wireless solar PTZ camera I could mount away from the house that I could turn to look at the house as well as turn to view other areas of our property not covered by the cameras we already had.So I mounted the camera on a thick (schedule 40) PVC pipe and mounted the solar panel on the very top of the pole, I used 3 hose clamps to fasten the PVC pipe to a 4 foot metal fence post I hammered into the ground, so far it seems to working very well. I will upload a picture of it.I do a lot of research before buying tech stuff, and it would be difficult to find ANY product that is perfect or that you might wish had more or better features, but for the features you get with this camera (including solar powered, PTZ capability, Alexa connectivity) I really can't complain for the price paid.Note: Remember this is not a commercial grade professional system, but commercial grade features likely cost much higher commercial grade prices, so again, for the price paid I really can't complain, I feel this camera does really pretty good for it's price level !","I placed this camera in my front yard on a tree, I however had to buy a longer WiFi antenna because it was lagging a lot . But the antenna really helped once I replaced the factory one. It is a good quality product thou. Keep it close to your house and your ok with the factory antenna. I would purchase again !","Its been holding up outside in winter weather down to freezing temps. decent quality video and excellent alerts on the cheap, Solar panel works greattoo but needs at least a couple hours of decent sunlight to charge well.",4290,549,https://www.amazon.com/REOLINK-Argus-PT-Solar-Panel/dp/B07W6PXRR8/ref=sxin_13_trr_898400_7?cv_ct_cx=wireless+home+security+cameras&keywords=wireless+home+security+cameras&pd_rd_i=B07W6PXRR8&pd_rd_r=13c2000f-f9e1-4e24-9f53-0f52e90717d0&pd_rd_w=OnmnW&pd_rd_wg=oBy7M&pf_rd_p=4d8c4287-5cf4-4061-b040-4022cf74abab&pf_rd_r=97WD42X9PWK1501TTPRW&qid=1640229985&sr=1-8-5519553e-2baa-451e-af83-b0156e5c6669

I was very impressed with the picture quality and ease of the setup. I have a system at my home and it's a professional quality and name brand and does not have the quality pictures as this Hiseeu system. I posted pictures I took from his monitor. These pictures are without a wifi hookup, just from the outside transmission from the cameras to the main unit. Before I installed this system I tested it at my hose to make sure it worked properly and it passed with flying colors. My home is about 3800 sq. feet and of course the cameras on the first level worked fine as being the closest, and to test it further I placed two other cameras as far as I could on the lower level and closed all the doors. Again all cameras produced sharp detailed pictures. I am not a professional installer, however I did install my 16 camera system and am very glad I suggested the Hiseeu system","I bought the DVR with 4 wifi cameras and I really liked the quality of the product, the excellent support provided by johnny and the support provided.

The motion detection feature allows you to choose sections of the room you want monitored. The night vision is provides good quality captures and we were surprised the battery life is rated for two years. However, please keep in mind that it could change base on how much you use the live view, how often it triggers to record, how long the duration of recording, is set to, and if your wifi signaling is bad.Note: if you have a large area or areas with lots of obstructions (i.e. cement, brick, steel, and aluminum) walls you may want to have a wifi meshed network to extend you wifi network pass these obstructions. We have the Google Nest Wifi system. Also, the blink camera must connect to the sync module via low frequency radio (LFR). Because of this, the camera must be within distance of the sync module. This is separate from your home wifi network. My suggestion is to get another syn-module if you run into issues where your single sync-module cannot cover all camera areas.","The all-new Blink Indoor – wireless, HD security camera appears to be a good product at a reasonable price. I bought a set of three that came with a Sync module. I believe up to 10 devices can be connected wirelessly to the Sync module that communicates using your home wifi.

This is the one!!,ZEEPORTE has redeemed my confidence in wireless security cameras!,Security Camera outdoor,For the price this camera exceeded my expectations.,OUTSTANDING CAMERA!,"My criteria for security cameras is as follows:1) Good quality picture2) Triggers at good distances3) Records videos locally (no monthly fee and privacy)4) Low number of false triggers5) A good phone app to control the cameras and view the videos.6) A reasonable priceThe Zeeporte camera checks all of the above boxes.I'll start here by saying that I've tried Eufy 2C, Vava, and Blink X2C systems. They are all more expensive (and sometimes much more expensive) than the Zeeporte. But the Zeeporte is a superior system to all that I've tried so far.The battery life of this camera is decent. I've used it heavily over the past 6+ days with many tests. I've recorded 209 motions and it is at 89%. Since I've used it heavily, I'll estimate 10% per week which means that it'll last 10 weeks (2.5 months) on a charge. In regards to size of the memory card that you'll need, I've used .22GB of the 120 GB card that I bought. At the current rate, it will record for 1.5 years before getting full - and then I'll just reset it. It is easy to transfer clips to your phone storage (online for my iphone).When I did my testing, I set it to the motion detection sensitivity to the highest value (95). What really impresses me with this camera is the low number of false triggers.. Really, I get none. It records people and cars and that is it. And it does not seem to miss any events. The angle of the camera did affect the distance of the triggering so try different angles.The only area of improvement that I can see is the mount. It is fine, but as I noted in my headline, I've tried several brands now including Eufy, Vava, and Blink. All of these brands had superior mounts, but the one that Zeeporte mount is fine. I had to make sure I tightened it well. One note - the other manufacturers that I listed require base stations and do not record on the camera itself. The Zeeporte does. This means if someone steals your camera, then they will get your videos. So, just don't put your camera within reach. A camera should not be mounted low and the instructions tell you to not do so. This is probably another reason that Zeeporte does not have a magnetic mount.. which would make it easy to steal. The mount that it has requires you to screw it off.Oh.. I just remembered another great feature of the Zeeporte. After your day is finished, you can view the events for the day (and all prior days) in a mode that shows you a timeline and lets you quickly sweep to each event based on the time and watch it. This is really nice to have!Overall, I do recommend it 100%","Last night was a disaster for me as I tried to get another brand of security cam to activate, I spent at least 5 + hours agonizing over the instructions, questioning my own intelligence and more 'Is it me?', I kept asking self.Long story short, it wasn't me, it was the product, and so going to return it.But smartly I ordered two security cams by two different companies and I'm here to say that 'ZEEPORT' has redeemed my happiness and joy and confidence in my ability to set up wireless WIFI connected security cameras...Also I timed it, from time I started activation to time it was up and running and it took less than 25 minutes!...I""m sure those more tech savvy than myself could do it in 15 or 10 minutes or less, I kid you not.Yes I'm a bit emotional cause coming off of a bruising night fooling around with that other security 'dome' camera system, which iI will not name, but if seek out my other review, you may stumble upon it...so yes I'm estatic right now cause ZEEPORTE delivered to me what they promised, a product that works right out of the box, a product to where you don't have to be a computer scientist to figure out, and all along the way, through each step, on your phone there's a 'help tab', in case you need help.Their 'help' doesn't hide from you.In closing, to be honest this can't be considered a totally full review, cause I haven't left my home yet and tried viewing camera from afar, until I do that, only consider this a 50% review.But will say WIFI connection was super easy...I mean super easy, compared to lasts night nightmare with other product (actually it was easy also, but after wifi connected to product their 'network' did not function).Anyways, so far so good with this product and will give another review as soon as can test away from home and see how it does then.It's a outdoor camera, but I have it indoors for now since other products failed me, I will order more though, probably from this brand, we shall see.","I love this camera, it gives great night vision even when my yard light is not on. Motion detection is great it alert me on everything it captures including the garbage man waking me up not to miss my trash guy, The birds in the attic, The neighbour talk. Even when it very windy and something is blowing across the street. Picture quality is absolutely awesome and incredible clear as day light. I call see all three of my neighbors home including mine. The voice quality is very good. If you asked me if I would recommend this camera to anyone else I would not hesitate to yes. I would recommend this to everyone. That's one reason. Why I gave this camera a 5 star. Yes it will video when you tap on the screen to see what going on for as long as you wish. The installation is easy all you have to do is charge for how long the instruction says. I have not charge mine since I put it up and it still has a full battery. This is a great gift and if you live alone and travel it's great to have because you can also put on the away button on your camera. . Ank me again and I will tell I am getting ready to purchase a second one for my home. I wish they came in a double pack. It gives me a piece of mind when I sleep at night to know I am safe. If I could give this camera a 10 out of 10 I would. I surely recommend this to anyone who is looking to purchase a camera for their home.","For my first ever security camera I am highly impressed. I needed a battery operated camera with easy installation and this one is perfect. Set up was easy, it was mostly charged when I received it and I easy drilled it to a tree. WiFi connection is excellent, picture quality is pretty good and the night vision is really good. I noticed the picture quality is better on sunny days rather then really cloudy days. You can change the motion detection, watch live, download videos and delete video all from the free app that you download. Honestly for the price I think I that this camera is pretty awesome and far better then I actually expected. You need a microsd card and to download an app. Other then that everything else is a piece of cake. I would recommend this camera.","I was sceptical at first on purchasing this security camera.I was looking for a really good security camera for the outside of my house.I have simplysafe for my home security system and have there camera as well inside but am not impressed with putting one of there security camera outside of the house.after reading the reviews on this camera.I figured that I would take the chance with it and see how it would perform.after unboxing the camera,and going thru the instructions which were very easy to understand.I figured I would just stick the camera temporarily inside the window seal and see how it would perform, before I mount it.and I must say that I was more then pleased with the clarity of the picture.as you can see from the above pictures.shooting thru the window from the distance that I had it was outstanding. Which I plan to install outside which will work great with my motion lights outhere. As far as the motion sensor it picks up motion great .you can adjust in the setting to suit you,it also has a home mode along with an away mode...as far as battery life I will have to up date in a later review.it came fully charged and seems to be holding pretty good.I must say if you are looking for a really good security camera,I believe you will be more then impressed with this one.Hands down it beats my simply safe cam hands down and for alot less priced.",4677,1,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Rechargeable-Surveillance-Waterproof-Detection/dp/B086V5H1YQ/ref=sxin_13_trr_898400_6?cv_ct_cx=wireless+home+security+cameras&keywords=wireless+home+security+cameras&pd_rd_i=B086V5H1YQ&pd_rd_r=13c2000f-f9e1-4e24-9f53-0f52e90717d0&pd_rd_w=OnmnW&pd_rd_wg=oBy7M&pf_rd_p=4d8c4287-5cf4-4061-b040-4022cf74abab&pf_rd_r=97WD42X9PWK1501TTPRW&qid=1640229985&sr=1-7-5519553e-2baa-451e-af83-b0156e5c6669

The following is my experience:1. Good price.2. Very quiet NVR. I can barely hear any noise from the NVR in any room. I think it is because the NVR doesn't have a fan - not sure it is good or bad.3. Good video quality during daytime and night.4. Setup is easy. Cameras were already linked to the NVR once I received it.5. Robust remote view app on mobile devices - though its user interface could be better (see below).6. Great customer service - Daisy helped me over the phone for a few issues (see below). She even called me back and left me a few voice messages to make sure I am satisfied. Much appreciated!Now for the areas which could be improved:A. It takes 3.5 inch hard drives. I bought a NVR without a hard drive because I have an spare 1T 2.5 inch hard drive from my old laptop - that will save me about $50. After I opened the NVR to install the hard drive, I found the 4 pre-drilled holes don't fit my 2.5 inch hard drive. I was disappointed because the description on Amazon says: (4TB HDD Max can be supported: Internal, SATA Interface, 3.5/2.5inches). I read the manual (operation guide). It says ""Please purchase HDD (SATA 3.5"")"" (on page 06). Luckily the wiring works. So I just used one screw to install my 2.5 inch hard drive. The NVR has lots of empty space in the box. I would suggest make room for both 2.5"" and 3.5"" hard drives.B. The camera antenna can be attached to the left side of the camera only. This causes some problems for me. It would be nice if the antenna can be attached to either side of the camera.C. No dome camera is available for this kit. I would like to add one dome (or fish eye) camera to the system. Unfortunately they don't make it.D. The first time I connect the NVR to the TV in my family room with HDMI cable, the TV shows ""Mode Not Supported"". I called the customer service. Daisy gave me some tips to trouble shoot the issue: use a VGA cable or a different TV. I followed her advice. VGA cable and another TV all work fine. So that means the TV in my family room might not be compatible with this NVR.E. One camera's signal was on and off. Daisy pointed out that camera might be too far from the NVR or there might be too many walls between the camera and the NVR. She patiently went through the ""repeater"" setup procedure with me on the phone. Basically, a camera (with good signals) close to both the problematic camera and NVR was setup as a repeater to take the signal from the problematic camera then pass it to the NVR. It fixed the problem. Thanks, Daisy.F. The camera's base is too small. A little bit bigger base will make the camera more stable.G. There are 3 or 4 screws to adjust the camera's angle and position. They are not well designed.H. The remote view app on mobile device, Danale, is solid. However, the user face has room to improve. For example, in one camera view mode, swipe to left or right should show the previous or next camera.I. During the setup, I was asked to provide the password for my home wifi. I was very hesitate to provide my password though I did it eventually. Anyone knows if this poses a security risk?This wireless surveillance system is very good considering its price. I will upload some pictures and report back in a few months.","In researching a wi-fi only camera system, I purchased four systems on Amazon, and returned three and kept this one. I purchased systems from OnWOTE, HISEEU, Firstrend, and Canavis. If you are shopping for a wi-fi security system with a good image, and great wifi reception, which is critical to the system working properly, this system from Firstrend is your best bet related to cost, and as others have mentioned the customer service.I will briefing describe the issues with the other systems, this is based on my opinion and the operation of the systems based on where we needed the cameras and systems to be placed. The OnWOTE system had just average picture quality, and not good night vision at all. In addition I would loose connectivity with cameras often. The HiSeeu system was OK, but I have a power supply fail repeatedly and contacted customer support via email. Johnny replied and agreed to ship a new power supply to me. He sent me an email showing a shipment notification, but almost one month after that email I have never received anything. With the power supply failing, and lack luster customer service that system was returned. The Canavis system had the best picture quality and the worst reception range for the cameras. I wanted to like and keep the Canavis system, but the dropping of the connection and the slow transfer rates resulted in the return of this system as well. Yes I know, I could have purchased a wi-fi range extender to improve the reception, but WHY should I have to do that. I am not looking for a mile of connectivity just a normal two story home. And if I am spending $200 on the system, it should just work out of the box. The Firstrend system has a great picture and good night vision. One of the best parts is the connectivity of the system. I am getting excellent signal transmission on the unit and cameras, from the same locations the other units were failing. I did have one issue and that was one of the camera was great in the daytime, but at night the image was foggy almost like it had condensation behind the lens of the camera. So I contacted customer support via email, and received an email back within one day. They asked a few trouble shooting questions, normal stuff, and agreed to send me a new camera. That was great customer service. Within a few days the new camera arrived, and I could not add it to my system following the instructions that were sent via email with the shipment notification. So I found a phone number for Firstrend, 888-806-1588 called the number left a voice message, and sent an email as well. The instructions they sent appeared to be for a different system due to the menu configuration. Within one day, I received a phone call from an international number, it was Firstrend. Wow, they did return my call. During the call the nice lady discussed with me my situation about not being able to add the new camera to my system. She researched my order, and the camera they sent me to replace it. She discovered the new camera was not compatible with the system I purchased. She promptly stated she was sending me a new camera for my system, and for me to keep the camera that had sent in error. I asked how long would the new camera take, and she added priority shipping at no charge as well. So that evening I received an email from Firstrend with a screenshot of the order being placed for a new camera and 2 day shipping. So I really could not ask for much more customer service than that. I have had the system up and running for over two weeks now and really can't stress enough that the reception range on this system and the cameras is very good. I had to adjust the direction of the antennas on the cameras for maximum throughput, but it is running well.So in conclusion, for the money, the Firstrend system is great - and the customer service is outstanding. I am hoping the system lasts for a couple of years, so we will see.Take care,",Easiest setup ever. I actually returned a zmodo camera system that was way too difficult. The support for firstrend is the greatest. They stayed on the phone until I was finished setting up the system. I love these guys.,"I really like this camera system, it has easy installation, clear videos, good price, etc. I highly recommend this camera to anyone who needs a security camera system.","I purchased the Firstrend Camera System with 4 cameras and no hard drive. The instructions were simple and the cameras linked up with the NVR as soon as I turned on the system. However, due to my own error, two cameras subsequently disconnected from the NVR, and I was very discouraged for about 24 hours. However, the Firstrend support is very good. Owen returned my call and emailed me some instructions that fixed the problem immediately.The wireless signal strength is good--I have one camera that is located one floor above and about 35 feet away from the NVR, and it syncs with the NVR flawlessly. However, if you should have a problem, Firstrend sells a signal booster that will likely fix the problem.The picture quality is outstanding and the infrared night vision is awesome--I can easily see 80 to 100 feet out. I installed a 1 terabyte hard drive in the NVR. It was easy to format and is large enough for my purposes.The Danale remote view software is excellent. It will be nice to visually check in on our home when we are away.All in all, a very good system at an economical price.",2205,966,https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Security-Firstrend-Pre-Installed-Outdoor/dp/B077HX91ZN/ref=sr_1_21?keywords=wireless+home+security+cameras&qid=1640229985&sr=8-21

In the kit, you get the control module with a 1 Tb hard drive for recording security footage. You also get 4 cameras that connect wirelessly to the system. The cameras require 12V DC power input; 4 adapters are included in the set. The system can accept input from up to 8 cameras, so you can add cameras if you need. The included cameras come pre-paired with the system and ready to go. The cameras can repeat each other’s signals, so they can be strung out across your property, each no more than 600’ from the last. The system offers remote access through the Tuya security app (no subscriptions necessary). Also included in the box is a set of security video warning stickers.I find this a good upgrade from old security system which was 10 years old. The camera images are sharper, especially at night. The recording capability works well, and it’s great to have remote access without having to pay monthly subscription fees; cloud backup storage does require fees though. Setup took a while. It wasn’t that complicated given the size of the system, but I took some time, adding one camera at a time to establish a chain of connectivity across my property. The cameras have rugged steel frames and they feel like they will last a good long time.

With the new indoor cam I can now access all my cams from one app. To me the picture quality is great overall and especially in total darkness. Live view connection is a lot more stable than my Wyze cams. Alexa integration is a big plus, no need for third party hacks to complete routines. Because I already have Ring cameras it’s worth it to pay a little more over a Wyze cam.","In February, I noticed my ADHD medication ran out early. I’m very careful about taking it exactly as prescribed so it was strange that I had run out 10 days early. For reasons I won’t get into for this review, I suspected the property manager of my building was stealing it. Obviously that sounded crazy, but I couldn’t think of another explanation. A friend suggested a Ring camera, so I bought one never expecting anything to actually come of it. I put some antihistamines in my now empty pill bottle thinking no one would ever take them, set up the camera when it arrived, and felt more secure knowing it was there. Set up was simple so I figured worst case scenario, I was out a bit of money and I spent maybe 10 minutes setting it up.Fast forward a week later when I get a notification via the app that there was motion detected on my camera. I open up the recording and there she is, entering my apartment, going right for my decoy pills, taking them, and leaving. I immediately left work to get back home. I called the police who sent an officer. I showed him the video and he admitted that had I not had the video, he wouldn’t have believed me. I was able to quickly and easily send the video to the police and to the president of the company that owns my building. I also was able to download the video and get it uploaded so that I have copies of it as I go through the next few months as she (hopefully) gets brought to justice.I cannot emphasize how much this little camera has helped me. I would not have caught my burglar otherwise. Because of it, they were able to look up records of who used their electronic key to access my apartment and she had been in there 7 times over the month prior. This would have gone on for longer and who knows if it would have resulted in harm to myself or my cat had I not caught her. This camera has given some of the sense of security she stole from me back and stopped a nightmare situation from worsening. I will still be recovering from this for long time and I am hoping she is brought to justice, but I cannot thank Ring enough for helping me secure my home from an unexpected source of danger.","This camera for $60 is a solid deal.

I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't. None. Not a single thing.It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways. I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed. Nope.I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house. Nope. There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not. They are not location aware in any way. The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording. Nope!The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours. Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room. I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on. This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%. This is with all the 'battery saving options' on. This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording. So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing. I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality. The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.***UPDATE***Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera. You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then. Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't. Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera. The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support. Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.***ANOTHER UPDATE***From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"". This will be a great update and should have been available on launch. I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.***ONE MORE UPDATE***Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days. It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration. With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set. They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away. For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off. You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc. Or any combination. The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can. This is a great improvement. They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5. This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras. I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.***LAST UPDATE***Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I've had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now. All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night. Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn't bad. I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it's pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation. They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you're thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them.","Before I start my revised review, let me state that there's been a lot of news lately about people hacking into Ring cameras, but this only happens when someone installs a new camera and doesn't update the default username and password (or has an extremely weak password which is easy for a hacker to guess). This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions.Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product.Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all.Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement.A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring.Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised.***UPDATE***Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices.Ring has now updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new wireless battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well.Observations.Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool.I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a few months before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent.I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once.Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete.I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic.Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.","Had the camera up and running in less than ten minutes. Excellent quality picture. Hooking up to the solar panel when installing, this way battery is always charged. Received mounting hardware, camera has been installed.",Installed 2 of these outside my house in about 20 minutes. Mounted one above my garage and the other near my front door. The video quality is pretty good. Not facial recognition software good but good enough for a good description of people if needed. I used the mounts that came will the camera and scanned the QR code for setup. Not sure why people couldn't set up zones. It is part of the setup unless you skip over the steps. I do agree with most reviews that the notifications are spotty. Took my trash out and the one by the garage only recorded me going to the side of the house and the one by the front door only recorded me coming back. A neighbor walked by this morning and it started recording after they walked by and were down the street. Pic attached. Went outside again and the both cameras picked me up as I would have expected. I will adjust the camera and reset the zones to see if that helps. They are my first Ring cameras so there may be fine tuning on my part that is needed. Will update this as the days go by.Windows 10 app logs me in but says I don't have any cameras set up. Tried on a PC and 2 laptops. Please fix!!Phone apps are pretty good so far. (Samsung note 9)Updating to 5 Stars.....After adjusting my zones and motion settings I was able to get the results I needed. At one point the wind blew leaves across my driveway and my sensor went off. After fine tuning I see no issues with the camera and its performance. It is by far better than other cameras I have purchase over the years and after comparing subscriptions from other companies $10 a month or $100 is a deal.,Don’t let any negative reviews influence your decision to buy these cameras. The negative reviews are from people who have not read the instructions or just have no idea how a security camera works. I monitor 16 security cameras where I work so I have a lot of experience with them. I bought the Ring Stick up camera and the solar charger for it as well. They both work great. I bought two more a week later. Now a month later I have no issues with battery power loss of any kind. Just set your zones to cover what you want. Don’t put motion sensor on full or you will catch bugs and falling leaves. I set my sensitivity in the middle. The image quality day and night is pretty good. You can also look at your cameras from a computer as well as your phone. You don’t need an Alexa to use these. The microphone works well too. Overall I would highly recommend these if you just read and understand the instructions and how they work which is very simple and easy.MD in SC 1-1-21,35984,1,https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Stick-Up-Cam-Battery-HD-security-camera-with-two-way-talk-Works-with-Alexa-/dp/B07Q6ZZFLS/ref=sr_1_7_sspa?keywords=wireless+home+security+cameras&qid=1640229985&sr=8-7-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzTkFCV0dFVlQwUDBZJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzYxOTk0MkhDSURVUTFLVVVRWiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNzI2ODQyMks1TFUxVDFUVU5PJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

I have had CCTV cameras in my house for years. I've been using Swann wired cameras for the most part with mixed emotions. But running new wires to upgrade the system just didn't excite me.I had been looking at NEST cams since I have the smart Thermostats and Smoke/Carbon-monoxide detectors for a while, but the price is ridiculous! Plus your only option with them is cloud service (an additional cost). Then I spoke with a neighbor who sent me a screen shot from his YI camera. I must say, the quality was pretty impressive.So I bought a four pack for $119.00 with moderate expectations. Let me tell you I'm super impressed with the picture quality of these cameras. Set up is quick and easy. When I purchased them I had no idea they had audio as well. The audio quality is incredible, plus it's a two way speaker. Purchased 32 GB SD cards for all of them so I didn't need to use cloud storage and it's been working great! I have them set to record all motion and I usually have about 7 days of history on each camera.Day and night vision are both spectacular IMO. I have attached several photos so you can see the quality both day and night. Side note, I have a couple ""indoor cams"" mounted outside. To do this I purchased a rubber sleeve/cover from Amazon to make the drop cam weather resistant for outdoor application. It's been through rain, sleet and snow with out issue so far. Link to cover: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FD5XHMP/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1A couple cons, the power cable is sooooooo short. I had to purchased longer cables for a couple of my installs. No biggie, they are only a few dollars here on Amazon. The app for iOS is very functional, but it has no multi camera view which would be a nice option.","So I have been using the Yi 1080p indoor camera system for 2 weeks now and I LOVE IT! The camera's are crystal clear during the day and are just as sharp in night mode. The added features of being able to hide any ""lights"" such as the blue power light and the typical red IR lights for night vision makes ""hiding"" these cameras a breeze. The playback function works great and give you the time in hours, minutes & seconds. The 2 way talk feature works great and has 2 modes, 1 is a push to talk feature where when you press the button you cannot hear what the person on the camera is saying and the 2nd is a continuous talk where you and the person on the camera can talk back and forth without pressing any buttons (love this feature) the 32gig on board storage is also a great bonus. Like I said I have been using the cameras for about 2 weeks and have barely used 3 gigs of space. (for an idea of the amount of traffic, it's just me, my wife and our 2 pets) so the cameras don't get a ton of action during the week. But are always recording on any motion. (I do not subscribe to the cloud storage as for I haven't seen a need) Anytime you get an alert it will store it on the app and you can upload it to your mobile device and share it with others. The initial motion detection clip is only 6 seconds, but if you wait till the end of the 6 seconds you will get an option to ""view entire motion"" which will bring up that camera, rewind to when it first detected the motion and play it back until there is no longer any motion, GREAT feature. All of the features seem to work as expected, you can set times for your camera to alert you when it detects motion and zones so that your dog walking around doesn't keep triggering the alerts. I can say the motion detection is VERY sensitive. You can set the setting to low, medium or high but really I can't tell a difference low to high. I have one camera facing out of my front window and it picks up shadows, car lights, leaves blowing, etc. Not a big deal, but on a windy day I can get a ton of alerts. The app works great, you can set a PIN or use your fingerprint to log into the cameras so in the event your phone is stolen, unless they have your PIN or fingerprint they will not be able to pull up your cameras. Connecting them was very simple and took less than 5 minutes per camera. Plug them in, scan the UR code and they will automatically connect to the network your phone is connected to. The packaging was very nice, didn't feel cheap. All cameras were individually wrapped along with all of the accessories. Comes with instruction booklet for assistance with installing/setup. The camera (black part) can be removed from the white base and mounted in different areas. They also sell (separately) wall mounts for the cameras. (cheap, like $10-$15 for a 4 pack) or you can stand them up anywhere you like (they have a round rubber grip on the bottom to help keep them from sliding around. All 4 cameras come with a USB cord and power brick. The USB cord is about 10-12 feet long so you should be able to place these cameras wherever you'd like. OK so I hope this rant...I mean review was helpful. If you're anything like me, I read all the reviews on a product before I make a purchase. Thanks for reading!***(I am not affiliated with Yi or any of there products, this was simple a consumer review, please purchase these at your own risk)***","I purchased the Yi 4 pk. 1080 Indoor security cameras. I was skeptical but am so glad I took the chance. I placed them in various windows facing outside as it’s outside I want to observe. They work perfectly during the day and, where the outside area is lit, at night. If the area is not lit, there is a reflection on the glass from the IR light, but they ARE designed to be indoor cameras. They work very well indoors, day and night, as intended. I have observed some sketchy people that have rung my doorbell when I’m not home (I have a camera in the window next to door), along with the neighbor’s cat, a family of raccoons, an opossum and numerous squirrels. I had an issue where they stopped alerting me of activity (which I see some others have had, also) and contacted Yi customer service. They promptly replied to my request and worked with me to make sure all my phone settings were correct. Turned out, the problem was with my phone settings, battery saver shutting down the app, NOT with the cameras or their app. I especially love that I can insert my own sd cards to save & view past events and not have to pay for ‘cloud’ subscription. I don’t know of another security camera that offers this. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase! In fact, I ordered another set of 4. If you are still in doubt, look up some reviews and comparisons of the Yi cameras on youtube.",,"Best Security Option for a home because:1. Its a one time charge- no monthly subscription- and all of the features of the camera work with the SD card2.

From when I first opened the box I was very impressed with the packaging and the high quality of materials used to make this product. I could see that much thought and consideration was put into the design. The software installation was a breeze! Once I downloaded the app and turned on the camera, the app immediately recognized the camera and just a few simple steps later my camera was ready to work. I was also very happy to see that I had a few options for mounting the camera and what really made my day was that I was able to mount the camera without having to drill any permanent holes in the walls. (there is also the option to mount it via a screw and hanging it). Once the mount is secure on the wall, attaching the camera to it with the built-in magnet is easy and ball design allows you to adjust the camera angle or remove the camera at any given time.Immediately after I completed the setup and installation, I get real-time notifications when there is any motion detection. As long as I have a stable connection on my phone, I have the option to use the intercom function to speak to whoever is at my door. What I really like about the notification function is that I can go back and view screenshots as well as video. The quality of the picture and video is very good and the night vision function works incredibly well. I attached a picture to this review of my two dogs in a completely blacked out room.The waterproof design is also nice to have although it was not a necessity for me now, it may come in handy some day.I have used the camera indoors at times to check in on my dogs and now mostly use it for the front and rear entry to my house.Now what really surprised me most with this camera is the battery life. I was very skeptic to the claims made in the listing but now after nearly 6 weeks of daily usage and the battery indicator shows full bars! Well, color me impressed!!!Overall it is great for me to be able to see who is at my door, whether I am home or not.One thing I would like to add and I hope the seller can see this comment is that the font on the instruction manual is very very small. I recommend enlarging the font so that it can be easily read by old timers like me.","I recently planned to go out of country for few days and wanted to have a camera to keep an eye on my house while I am away. Once the product was received, my daughter could do the set up in just few minutes using my phone. I installed this in the front porch using the included stickers. Magnetic attachment is super easy to bring in for charging. I didn't want any wiring and any hard installation in the wall. So the set up was really easy. Location of the device is about 40ft from the router. I charged it to 100% though it came pre charged. Picture quality is super clear. Night vision is perfect. Monitored the view from different country for days and the camera still was 100% charged. Very happy with the purchase. Motion activation is perfect, sends a message to my phone. I haven't used the SD card option yet.",,"I know the saying you get what you paid for, and I found this camera to be a great value. The price and reviews were what sold me. My experience is as follows.......First fast delivery with prime. Received and installed 5/7/2019 ...Then my device was fully charged and undamaged when received. Simple directions. Great pics and night vision, easy installation. Motion detection works well as well as the person to person intercom. The camera is also (in my opinion) of good quality, heavy duty. I would say that especially after I dropped twice with clumsy hands (not on purpose) in stalling memory card. Maybe 4’.5” above floor. As far as the app, it works fine , I do wish that you could send videos or pics to email since it is connected to my internet with out taking memory card out... but this is not a deal breaker. I will be going on trip and will test long distance receiving of notifications. One of the neighbors’ kids set it off and I was notified pretty quick. I show that the camera is running at 52% internet signal because of installation distance from router, and still get impressive results. I read somewhere that the battery will or could last to upwards to 120 days in standby operation, .... after trip I plan on making another purchase... I may or may not get a router signal booster, but I am very happy with my decision and experience with this camera. I will post and update on battery performance later when I have to charge again but we all know that the amount of time on live feeds and motion detection will need to be taken into an account... P.S. I will post pics soon.","Surprisingly, this is a pretty good quality camera. I like that it alerts you when theres any movement detected. It recorded and take pictures when theres movement. With that being said you can put an SD card in to save your pictures and videos but theres also a cloud where you can choose to pay monthly or yearly. So you have options to either choose SD or a Cloud monthly/yearly subscription.UPDATE on battery life: I received this item on june 6th but I didnt put it up until june 10th and right now is july 6th. So the battery is at 18% as of right now. So if you use the camera as often as I did(every time theres a notifications due to high sensitivity movements) of course it'll take up the battery. It did however notify me that its 18% and it needs to be charged or it will automatically shut off. Still not bad. Planning on buying another to rotate while the other one is charging. Picture quality is pretty good.On another note, there's a solar for this camera that can be charged without having to take it down to plug in to charge. Less worries about the battery being low and it'll continously charge throughout the day.",13997,2,https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Rechargeable-Detection-Waterproof-compatible/dp/B07PM2NBGT/ref=sxin_15?asc_contentid=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&asc_contenttype=article&ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B07PM2NBGT&cv_ct_cx=wireless+indoor+security+camera&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_we=asin&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source-earns-comm&keywords=wireless+indoor+security+camera&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B07PM2NBGT&pd_rd_r=6b0a6301-9aab-439b-b21c-ab8b48967af0&pd_rd_w=jXHRU&pd_rd_wg=bmmcR&pf_rd_p=b029c82c-aced-48fe-b955-08794dc4e3cd&pf_rd_r=VJK997SEWAY37FZY9RWJ&qid=1640229088&sr=1-4-a3cc9a7a-2f07-46dc-8259-ac02200376a0&tag=scoutedv2-20

Blueiris is a wonderful software but very overwhelming to set up. This system is very simple. Plug and play. They simply just work straight out of the box.CAMERASThe bracket/mount for the camera is extremely easy to install. It's good for easy installation and bad since it is easy to detach if someone wants to steal but then I will have footage of the thief. I will take the easy install instead.I had to install sideway for 2 of the cameras due to my wire configuration. The image was rotated 180 degrees so they are correctly oriented. The only issue is the pics look stretch out when I make the fit to screen. Minor issue but I wish the screen just filled with black bar instead of stretched to fit especially in mobile app view.Night vision is great with infrared but since my house and front yard has decent light, I left the infrared light off. The night time images are way better than my old cameras I had.NVRFirst time when I hook up the NVR to my old TV that I was using before all I got was not supported error message. I had no idea what is not supported. After a quick Google search, I found that my TV has terribly low resolution that the NVR cannot display. After I swapped put the TV to a monitor, everything showed up great.Setting up the NVR was easy and straight forward. I was able to found all the cameras and able to add them, including my Amcrest doorbell even though the control/setting of the doorbell was very limited in NVR.I set up all the cameras setting and everything was working great. The problem I have was alarm set up. I set up to see the alarm message and they pop up but only stayed for a short time and went away. The message screen is still up but the actual messages disappeared. I don't see any other way to set them up so the alarm messages won't go away until I dismissed them.The motion detection detects every bit of pixel shifts of the scene. Since these cameras are not AI capable like Eufy, I understand why the every moments can cause the motion detection to go off. My cheap Wyze cameras are the same way but one thing I like is wyze will highlight the motion in green box to show what casued the camera to trigger. If Amcrest can implement something similar, that would be easy to track the reason of the motion alerts.When I turned on the face detection in the app, it turned on and saved the setting. But so far, I haven't noticed any face detection. I only see the normal motion detection. Snapshots are working great to glanced though the footage which is very helpful.These are my observations. I hope they are helpful.","Plugged everything in and powered it up. Immediately hit a snag where the region was set to Uzbekistan and English but both were greyed out and non-changeable. However I could change it via web browser, logged into the web admin where I could set region correctly.Checked NVR firmware which was up to date. Checked the cameras and they needed an update which was easy enough, hardest part was locating the camera firmware to download. I really liked that you could update all the cameras from one central place, that is a very nice feature.Setting up cameras in Blue Iris was surprisingly easy, just gave it the IP address and login info and it detected the first camera right away and gave me a picture. Subsequent cameras were also easy by cloning the settings for the first camera and editing. The cameras perform very well in Blue Iris.Cameras give a nice clear picture and seem well built. I thought at first the cameras didn't rotate on their base, but then discovered they do when I grasped and turned them. The way the camera attaches to the wall bracket seems firm enough, but I probably would have liked to see a screw to make theft of the cameras a little more difficult.The supplied cables have ends that didn't fit the waterproof coupler that comes with each camera. I was able to cut away the strain relief with a knife and the coupler then worked perfectly.The NVR has fairly comprehensive features, only thing I found missing was the ability to fast forward through sections of recording. The manual is rather lacking and there is no help built in. I didn't find it much of a problem, but if you haven't used some sort of camera system like this before it might be difficult.This was a massive upgrade from my old DVR system as the camera picture quality is really very good in daylight or night time.","I installed this product at my cousin's house, after he saw how responsive and clear the image is on my Blue Iris + Amcrest system was at home.We had to drill some holes in his walls to run CAT5e cabling from his bedroom to the living room, where we placed the NVR. We connected the NVR to his 75 inch 4K TV and it gives an impressive image!The image given over the included Amcrest View Pro software is crisp and fluid. The lighting situation on my cousin's porch is tricky; the porch light is always on and there is a Circle K located across the street with extremely bright lighting. I did not change any of the image settings such as exposure in the provided images, this is how it looks on auto mode, which is great.The cameras also include microphones which provide streaming audio to go with the video, so far I have not been in a situation where I would hear someone speaking; but I can very clearly hear the traffic in the street a good distance before I actually see the vehicle in view, so the microphone sensitivity must be pretty darn good.There is a bit of artifacting in the audio quality due to low bitrate, maybe Amcrest could raise the default value a hair.The app is very responsive when doing playback, after dragging the slider on the timeline, playback begins after 2-3 seconds. This is a fair bit more responsive than some other systems I have used.The most important thing to me is that Amcrest maintains full ONVIF compatibility, which means you can get as creative with your set up as you want. You can completely disable the P2P features and run the camera system on a separate, internal network with no internet connectivity, and set up your own NVR system using the software of your choice. This is important because the camera system you have mounted on your walls may exist longer than the company you purchased from!This is my third Amcrest-based system that I have installed in the past 2 years. This one using all Amcrest-provided hardware, the other 2 are a hybrid system using Blue Iris / Amcrest NVR / Amcrest Cameras. They are now my go-to recommendation for both work and at-home surveillance.","This is an excellent NVR and camera package. I actually had the standalone NVR (NV4108-HS) non-ethernet version of this and had a few cameras. So, I got this package and I have to say if you’re considering a non-ethernet version, this is the way to go. I have a full-stack Ubiquiti network, and for whatever reason, the cameras struggle to connect to my PoE switch. With this one – no issues whatsoever. You connect the cameras to the NVR and they just work. Also, the NVR came with the hard drive pre-installed. The last one I had to install a drive – very nice it was already installed.The NVR has (as far as I’m concerned) an easy-to-use and intuitive setup wizard to get it going. When you power on the NVR, it takes you through all the necessary steps to get it configured and set up (including adding the cameras). Then you’re ready to go. Mine shipped with the newer firmware, but if you have to update the firmware it’s not too hard. The user interface on these newer NVRs is so much better than the analog NVRs of the past which makes them an appealing option to many of the “subscription” based cameras such Nest, Arlo, Wyze, and many others. I like having my camera recordings stored locally and I like being able to use them without having to pay anyone.During the setup of the NVR, it guides you through a Peer-To-Peer setup of their Amcrest View PRO app which allows you to access your NVR remotely. Essentially Amcrest facilitates a secure connection between your device and the NVR with no subscription fees. The best part about this is that you don’t have to open any ports or anything in your router. The connection is automatic and transparent without any action on your part.The app does need some work but the notifications work well. They were right on par with my Nest Outdoor Cam and Wyze Cam and you tell the app what to when you tap on the notification. It allows you to select a few options two of which are opening to a live view of the camera or the recording event.The IP5M cameras are excellent! What makes them so excellent is their low-light performance. I really don’t like using IR if I don’t have to – you can see more detail without IR if you have enough ambient light. A great example of this is recently on my neighborhood Facebook page someone posted a video of someone trying to break into a car. The thieves pulled their car into their driveway and if they had IR turned off you might have been able to see the license plate, but because they had IR turned on the license plate just looked like a bright reflection. These IP5M cameras work well with low light and the picture almost rivals my Ubiquiti G4-PRO($449). The cameras have an excellent and high-quality microphone that can provide detailed audio once the “audio filter” has been disabled. The audio filter makes it sound like the microphone is underwater so I would strongly encourage doing that. You can disable the camera's microphone filter from the camera’s web interface.Speaking of the camera’s web interface. The camera's web interface CAN be accessed when they’re connected to the NVR. It may vary but you’ll use a URL similar to this http://<nvr-ip>:100. It’s the NVRs IP and then a port. You can see this if you use a browser to connect to the NVR and then select ‘Cameras’.Also, I would suggest changing the password again after you have finished the setup. I believe you change the password before adding the cameras. The cameras use a default login of admin/admin. If you change the NVR password after you have added the cameras it will update passwords on the cameras as well. The camera's web interface is accessible even if you’re not authenticated to the NVR.The NVR is fairly quiet and doesn’t run too warm as far as I can tell and with roughly 7 cameras connected with IR running it was using around 35 watts as measured with my kill-a-watt meter.Performance-wise – I would feel pretty confident that this NVR could record from six to seven 4K cameras running at their full FPS and resolution. I connected five IP5M cameras and two IP8M cameras all recording at their highest resolution and maximum FPS and set to record all the time and it was only using roughly 55Mbps out of 88Mbps of its available bandwidth. It doesn’t seem to struggle when recording but trying to playback the recordings you might be able to select 1-3 channels before it will say “Over decode ability”. I don’t really find that a problem as I’m only going to search one camera at a time. Also, a note about the matrix view of the NVR itself – it won’t play the 'main' stream from all the cameras. It will intelligently balance which stream it is showing in the matrix view – pretty smart.Playing back recordings is pretty easy – it’s easy to find motion events as the yellow blocks on the timeline. Downloading videos is tricky though – I would suggest using ‘SmartPSS’ and then watching a video on YouTube called “How to Playback and Export CCTV Video Using SmartPSS’ from ‘Auckland Security Cameras’. Also, be sure to read the ‘EXTRA NOTE:’ in the description.The method in the video works pretty well – as the video is very nice and clear if you can get the original video from the NVR itself.My favorite way to browse motion events is using the NVR itself (the web interface is decent from a Windows PC). The Amcrest App needs a lot of improvements before its usefulness will be on par with its competitors. If Amcrest nails their app down – this NVR with mobile app will be a game-changer.So, in summary: Great NVR, super simple to set up and configure, mobile motion notifications work great and built-in ethernet is life. Also, IP5M cameras are probably the best value in Amcrest’s lineup for quality and low-light performance!","I have several Amcrest cameras along with a few other brands as well. I’ve been using Blue Iris at home and an Amcrest NV4108-HS 4K 8CH NVR at a vacation home. I liked the simplicity of the NVR at our vacation home, and needed some more cameras at home and decided to add this NVR kit with 4 cameras. This kit does not disappoint. I already have a couple of the IP5M-T1179EW cameras, so I knew they had a great picture and good starlight performance at night especially considering the price point. Yes, there are better performing cameras with larger sensors for pro level night time performance, but they cost 2 to 3 times what these cameras do.Since I already owned the NVR at my vacation home, I mostly knew what to expect. One difference is that my other NVR did not include the POE ports. I honestly prefer that setup, as it allows me to run one cat5/6 cable to the back of the NVR and use static IP addresses that I setup on my router. The camera webgui’s are all easily accessed through a standard web browser. This version has the POE ports built in which does save on a POE switch or individual POE power supplies, but it gives you less flexibility on your camera placement. For example, you have to run all the cables back to the NVR from each camera vs just one cable from your router or a switch etc. You do still have the option of adding other cameras to the NVR through its LAN port vs the POE ports, so it does still give you the same flexibility if you want it. I just find the POE ports on the NVR as less convenient and redundant.That said, the POE ports can give you extra security as the NVR isolates them with a separate IP address format. My main router gives out addresses in the 192.168.1.xxx range, while the NVR addresses have their own IP range depending what you choose for example 10.1.1.128. The camera webgui’s are not readily accessible through a web browser as the IP address range is different from my routers range. You can access them if you log in to the NVR from a PC or mobile device and click on the link next to the camera. This will open the webgui of the individual camera. One caveat is to make sure the “Virtual Host” checkbox has been checked on the Network page of the NVR. It will allow you to resolve the address that is not in your routers range.One other note, I had no trouble accessing the cameras that were plugged into any of the POE ports other than Port 1. Amcrest uses an amended address, that of the NVR, plus a port number to access each camera. For example, in my Port 1, the camera was given an internal IP address of 10.1.1.128. When I click on the link to the cameras webgui within the NVR page, it directs me to 192.168.1.100:10080 for Port 1. (192.168.1.100 is my NVR IP as assigned by my router) The other ports follow with Port 2 as 192.168.1.100:10081, Port 3 as 192.168.1.100:10082 etc. The problem is that port 10080 has been deemed dangerous and has been blocked in most modern browsers, IE, Edge, Chrome etc. When you try to access the webgui of the camera in Port 1 of the POE ports, the browser will give you a blocked port error. There are ways to open up the port on various browsers, but it involves overriding the built-in behavior of the particular browser you are using. Just google unblock port 10080 for workarounds for your particular browser. Nevertheless, it is something that Amcrest should change with a firmware update that removes the use of that particular port. I haven’t seen any way to change the port range from within the NVR, so it’s something Amcrest has to address with a firmware update.If you are looking for top-of-the-line nighttime low light performance, you will have to pay a lot more and move up to cameras with larger sensors such as a 1/1.8” image sensor at 4mp or 1/1.2” at 8mp to get more low light capability at night. The sensor in the Amcrest IP5M-T1179EW cameras included with this NVR kit have 1/2.7” image sensor at 5mp. The more megapixels you cram onto a sensor reduces the low light sensitivity, unless you make the sensor larger to compensate for the extra pixels.Overall this system works well, and the cameras give a great mid-range consumer quality picture. Most users will be thrilled with the picture quality at day and night.",171,56,https://www.amazon.com/Amcrest-Security-Weatherproof-Pre-Installed-NV4108E-IP5M-T1179EW4-2TB/dp/B084NSYLRQ/ref=sxin_15?asc_contentid=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&asc_contenttype=article&ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B084NSYLRQ&cv_ct_cx=wireless+indoor+security+camera&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_we=asin&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source-earns-comm&keywords=wireless+indoor+security+camera&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B084NSYLRQ&pd_rd_r=6b0a6301-9aab-439b-b21c-ab8b48967af0&pd_rd_w=jXHRU&pd_rd_wg=bmmcR&pf_rd_p=b029c82c-aced-48fe-b955-08794dc4e3cd&pf_rd_r=VJK997SEWAY37FZY9RWJ&qid=1640229088&sr=1-1-a3cc9a7a-2f07-46dc-8259-ac02200376a0&tag=scoutedv2-20

It has been totally re-engineered. Take it from someone who owns all the different cameras Blink had to offer since day one and had to get on a waiting list to get the very first one. So, I should know what iam talking about. This new camera no longer has the push down and pull system to open the back to install batteries. It has a large screw that you simply unscrew with a included tool to open the back of the camera which is really nice. Once you open the back and install the included batteries scan the small QR code inside the camera threw the blink app it will scan to find the camera once that is done it will automatically do a firmware update. After that you are ready to install your new blink camera. Also noticed the sound is much louder and more clear then the other cameras. This is good if two people are talking in a low voice you can hear what they are saying. Has brighter clearer night vision. Nice clear voice communication with two way talk. Alot stronger wifi signal to sink module and from sink module to camera. Sharp, clear, bright, and colorful HD vision during the day. I noticed before I wrote this review that some people only gave this camera 2 or 3 stars. Like the guy who is complaining about software issues. Well if you follow the directions you would not have that problem. Let the camera finish its firmware update. Duh ! Also, if you have been a Blink customer for a while and want to add this camera to your current system. You do not have to pay for cloud storage you are grandfathered in. After you add this camera to your existing system it will actually tell you this ! The front of the camera has a all new face with a very smooth and shinny surface iam sure to help combat the weather and give it a more high tec look. Their is no longer a switch inside the camera to turn on or off the blue recording light located on the front of the camera. It's is all done threw the app which is really nice as well. They really did a good job in re-engineering this camera and listened to customer complaints about their past cameras and went threw and fixed every issue. I would definitely buy this camera again ! UPDATE : 09-25-20 After using this camera for a couple of days. And as other reviewers have noted that this camera only has a 25 foot motion trigger ! Anything further than 25 feet it will NOT record when motion is present. So if you need a camera get the Blink XT2 for the further range. This camera will only be good for specific areas like door or window that are within the 20 to 25 foot range from the camera.","It's super easy. Works great. Setup was simple. It works exactly as advertised. What I didn't know for sure is that the batteries are just high quality AA batteries. So when they die, you can get some rechargeable ones and just rotate them through the thing. I'm going to order a couple more. They are pretty great. *Edit-A nice person took the time to let me know it's best not to replace w/ traditional AA batteries.","So far everything is as advertised. Setup was a breeze and the image quality is great - especially when set to “best.” I really appreciate the custom activity zones that you can set, as well as the ability the turn off the led light.In terms of improvement, the included mount is pretty basic. For better or worse the mount snaps into the back of the camera module. This makes installing it relatively easy, but also means anyone could detach it with a firm pull. I’ve noticed that there are upgraded mounts that you buy, but haven’t had a chance to fully check those out yet.Lastly, I noticed another reviewer mentioned subscription pricing, but it’s a bit misleading. Yes, there is cloud storage that you can pay for, but there are multiple levels, including a free plan, as well as a basic plan for $3/month. Also, the paid plans don’t start until 2021. More importantly, What this camera has, that the XT2 doesn’t, is local storage. If you’re big on privacy, and don't want to store videos on the cloud, you can attach a USB drive to the blink module and save your videos there (see photo which shows the usb drive). There’s no fee for saving your videos locally - you can still get alerts and watch your video feed live for free.",What an awesome product...total install took 25 minutes. I put 3 camera’s up outside to monitor my summer home. One of the camera’s I places on a pole in the yard pointing at the roof so I can monitor snow fall and snow melt roof system. The app was friendly. I shared the app with my wife and she was up and running in 2 minutes with minimal effort. We are so happy with this wireless system.,88175,4,https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Outdoor-Wireless-Security-Camera-3cam/dp/B086DKSHQ4/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=wireless+indoor+security+camera&qid=1640229088&sr=8-6

The set up of the mini was FAR EASIER than the outside cams. I had this thing set up in less than 5 minutes. Picture is good. Sound is LOUD which is what I was looking for.The app however needs some work to support this style of camera. The app works decently for the BlinkXT cameras and functionality, which is motion for most users. As in you get a notification that there is motion, it records, and you watch the recording or live as you please. but it is clunky to get into the Blink Mini for the purpose of continuous viewing which is my intention for this camera, like a baby monitor. Like many other Americans now working from home with a full house of kids, I wanted to use this to assist with keeping an eye on the kids as I worked and record those cute moments. I wanted to use this to visualize a blind spot that I can’t see from the office. I tried mounting it from the ceiling and realized you can’t rotate the video. Mounting on the wall was a little problematic, I couldn’t quite get the right angle needed.Another quirk to the app is if you switch to another app and then come back to the Blink app, you have to hit the play button to resume viewing.All in all, these are minor issues specific to my use of the camera which is why I have it five stars anyway.Hey amazon/Blink, it would be an awesome feature if you’d allow the integration of this camera with Alexa so we can “drop in” and talk through the Echo Dot. Just saying.",I love this lil camera!! Easy to install! Only took 5 min and it works great!! Highly recommend this!!,Great price and product. Connected very easily to my existing Blink system. I am not happy with having to pay for storage after trial ends.,"This is a great little camera monitor. Pros: easy set up, easily managed with your smart phone, clear image quality with motion detection. Can be set up to arm and record at any time. I bought this to use in my master bedroom by my desk where I keep sensitive information.Cons: if you are using it with another Blink product and you arm 24/7 then the other Blink unit also needs to be armed which is an issue because my other unit uses 2 AA batteries. There is no timer on the app to set up a time to arm which would by useful because I sometimes forget to arm at night. It has good night vision quality. It needs to be plugged in so is a problem if you put it in a place (i.e. bedroom closet) if there is no outlet. Because of this, it is difficult to make the camera more hidden (if you are looking for a nanny camera for example).Overall it is easy to use and I would recommend it for a basic home security camera.","SO...I rarely write reviews but was so amazed by this camera I wanted to let others know. I bought the camera after using the Ring indoor camera for twice the price and it made a constant clicking noise with the filter adjustment to light in the room that was a known issue Ring told me and not a defect. I've tried all the other brands out there WYZE, etc and disappointed with all. Then I tried the Blink Mini which I thought was a good price. The setup was a breeze, up and running in 30 seconds. The app is responsive and user friendly. My wifi is sloooow but it still loaded a 1080p HD quality view w hen I accessed it from my mobile app. My favorite feature is the night vision. All my previous cameras just showed a dark room or shadows but this camera shows a clear and crisp picture in pitch black darkness. Very pleased with this and you can't go wrong here. My 2 year indoor camera journey has come to an end here.",148940,5,https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-Security-Camera-2-Pack/dp/B07X27VK3D/ref=sxin_15?asc_contentid=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&asc_contenttype=article&ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B07X27VK3D&cv_ct_cx=wireless+indoor+security+camera&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_we=asin&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source-earns-comm&keywords=wireless+indoor+security+camera&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B07X27VK3D&pd_rd_r=6b0a6301-9aab-439b-b21c-ab8b48967af0&pd_rd_w=jXHRU&pd_rd_wg=bmmcR&pf_rd_p=b029c82c-aced-48fe-b955-08794dc4e3cd&pf_rd_r=VJK997SEWAY37FZY9RWJ&qid=1640229088&sr=1-5-a3cc9a7a-2f07-46dc-8259-ac02200376a0&tag=scoutedv2-20

I was very impressed with the picture quality and ease of the setup. I have a system at my home and it's a professional quality and name brand and does not have the quality pictures as this Hiseeu system. I posted pictures I took from his monitor. These pictures are without a wifi hookup, just from the outside transmission from the cameras to the main unit. Before I installed this system I tested it at my hose to make sure it worked properly and it passed with flying colors. My home is about 3800 sq. feet and of course the cameras on the first level worked fine as being the closest, and to test it further I placed two other cameras as far as I could on the lower level and closed all the doors. Again all cameras produced sharp detailed pictures. I am not a professional installer, however I did install my 16 camera system and am very glad I suggested the Hiseeu system","I bought the DVR with 4 wifi cameras and I really liked the quality of the product, the excellent support provided by johnny and the support provided.

I got a crisp and clear video, posted to the Ring app, other neighbors checked their video and found the same man on their property, the police were involved immediately and the perp was taken back to jail.From the press release of our local PD:""On 5/11/20, [city] Police Department Patrol responded to a residential burglary that occurred the night before. The victim had left their garage door open and went for a walk around the neighborhood. During that time, from about 8 pm to 8:30 pm, an unknown subject later identified as [nam,e] entered the garage, rummaged through the cars and stole the victim’s mountain bike. While [name] was in the garage, the victim’s family was at home in the house....When the victim realized his bike had been stolen, he checked his Ring Camera video and saw that the suspect had been inside his garage. He posted the video onto the Ring Camera Neighborhood App, warning others in the area.Many community members had seen the video of the suspect and had been in contact with the [city] Police Street Crimes Unit (SCU). SCU and PROS (Post Release Offender Supervision) Detectives along with Patrol officers began looking for the suspect....This was an excellent example of the community working together to put a criminal back into jail....A review of the [city] Superior Court website shows that [name] has prior convictions for stealing a vehicle, robbery, using pepper spray to commit a violent felony, being under the influence of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of narcotics. [name] is currently on PROS/AB109 and was in custody and had recently been released from jail on May 8th by Probation due to Covid-19 concerns.""For a $60 camera, this was a great investment.Original Review----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I had 5 of the Amazon Cloud Cams, purchased about 18 months ago. Amazon then acquired Ring and Blink, and discontinued the Cloud Cams, although they still provide support (for now).I needed two new cameras, so I went with the Ring. Primarily because I heard nothing negative about the security, as opposed to Wyze. However, Ring has some real downsides relative to the Amazon Cloud Cams.1. More latency.I have great WiFi. I have multiple wi-fi mesh routers throughout the house with no dead spots. Still have to wait ~5-7 seconds to connect to live view. Cloud Cams was 3-5 seconds.2. No zoomI could tap and zoom on Cloud Cams. Can't do that with Ring.3. No live view via Web Browser.Apparently you can download an app on Windows 10, but I'm on a Mac and wonder why I can't view the video in a browser. I could go with Cloud Cams.4. I can't see multiple Cameras at once.With Cloud Cam, I could stream audio and video from all five cameras at once over the web. It was great. Having to switch between cameras, one at a time, and having to wait 5-7 seconds per camera, is a big downside.I get that Amazon needed to simplify its product portfolio after their two most recent acquisitions in this space, but it's a shame the Cloud Cam isn't sold anymore. It was a superior product offering in this space.Design, Packaging, Ease of Setup, and from what I can understand, Security is all excellent in Ring, and I have no complaints. The app, in spite of the one camera at a time limitation, is well-designed too.*** UPDATED 3-Jan-2020 ***I found the Rapid Ring app. It works in conjunction with the regular Ring app. Rapid Ring has limited functionality, but it does everything I need. Somehow, it manages to reduce latency to connect to the cameras. When I pull up the Rapid Ring app, I can connect to anyone of my cameras in <1 second. The app will also continuously reconnect to the camera after the 5 minute timeout period, so I can stream a camera indefinitely. I have upgraded my review to 4 stars. If Ring ever develops a generic web interface to view all cameras simultaneously, I will give 5 stars.","The video on these cams is amazing, I am comparing the performance to previous Ring Cam models, this is the best so far. Really crisp even when zooming the content of the video. Responsive, immediately playing the live video when requested. I am tickled pink with these Inside Stick Up Cams, will recommended to all over other brands. I have replaced two of my three Wyze Cams with these Ring Inside Stick Up Cams, well worth the added expense.I have at this time, the first generation Stick Up Cams (outside and in the garage), Pro Door Bell and two Ring Spot Light Cams (one wired and one battery powered), all are in excellent working order. The video on these Inside Stick Up Cams exceeds expectations in comparison with my existing Ring cameras.Inside I had three Wyze Cams, one that was chronically loosing itself from the network, another two that intermittently would loose themselves from the network. All were chronically unable to provide a video within the app without crashing or without taking valuable time to do so. My internet is very, very stout, throughput is excellent, download of 500+ Mpbs's and upload at over 30+ Mpbs's. So internet speed, latency and throughput are not the issue where any of these camera's are concerned. My decision to replace these Wyze Cams with the Ring Stick Up Cams is well founded, I am quite pleased.","I purchased the ring doorbell and two indoor camera one of which I actually turned outward to capture the driveway. I think functionality, resolution, and being able to access recorded video is all I could ask for. And all at a very reasonable price!Settings options are ample for things like motion zone adjustment , upside down camera placement with adjusted view on the receiver, and even a night glare adjustment if you choose to have an indoor camera face outward.Important to note that after a 30 day trial of free access to video recording, if you want continued access to recordings, it’s $3/month per camera for the basic plan or $10/month for all cameras - obviously makes sense to do if you have more than 3 cameras.I added two 10ft power cords in case either do the cameras placement was too far from an outlet for the cord that comes with the camera (I think it’s 6 or 7ft). Actually just moved one of the cameras and needed the longer cord which I had.Another great thing is that I can set up the app on multiple devices.https://smarthomestarter.com/can-you-install-ring-doorbell-without-turning-off-the-power/I decided on the Ring Doorbell Pro so I don’t have to deal with a battery powered device. The Pro model gets wired directly into where your doorbell is wired into so make sure to cut the power supply first! Also the Pro offers a chime you cam plug into a desired place to hear the doorbell","The RING indoor camera were very easy to mount and activate on my WiFi network. These camera have been integrated into a wide array of SmartHome devices to monitor infrastructure and security. While my Weil-McLain hot water boiler for hydronic radiant floor heat is capable of providing information on its operating status, it does not have the ability to notify me when an error message is generated. Using the RING Indoor cam, I can monitor the backlit screen of the boiler from anywhere in the world via an internet connection and the RING app (picture #1 is a screen shot from the RING app). I can control my garage doors remotely by internet connection and do receive open/close status via e-Mail, but wanted visual confirmation of door status especially if I gave someone remote access and wanted to make sure they closed the door after leaving. With a RING camera ceiling mounted in the garage, the wide field of view (picture #3 is screen shot of garage from RING app) allows monitoring of both doors. RING sells a longer power cable that eliminated the need for an extension cord to provide power. A tilt/swivel mount allows for optimized viewing angles. The mount can be easily configured for ceiling or wall mounting. The camera has a sensitive speaker/microphone. The RING app is easy to use for configuring range and sensitivity of motion as well as viewing with an adequate WiFi signal. My Router is at the opposite end of the house from the garage location and the other camera is in the basement-no problem quickly connecting to both cameras.","Let me start by saying I received no compensation of any kind for this review; it is my honest experience with Ring products. I am a senior, living alone, in a single family home. Security is a big concern for me but I could not afford any longer to pay the outrageous cost of ADT. My neighbors recommended Ring doorbells. I bought those first. I also needed something that would cover the outside of my home, my yard and driveway. I bought this set of 2 Ring indoor cameras. I installed them yesterday in less than 15 minutes with them sitting in window sills but pointed OUTWARD. They are just perfect!!! Because I live in Iowa with very harsh winters, I did not want to have to worry about changing batteries or a solar powered camera. These 2 little cameras plug into to any outlet and the view outside is absolutely clear. I highly recommend them for reasonable cost, ease of installation and for the ability to monitor the entire outside of my home without expensive installation charges.",12496,524,https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Ring-Indoor-Cam-Compact-Plug-In-HD-security-camera-with-two-way-talk-White-Works-with-Alexa-2-Pack/dp/B07RM6922G/ref=sxin_15?asc_contentid=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&asc_contenttype=article&ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B07RM6922G&cv_ct_cx=wireless+indoor+security+camera&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_we=asin&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source-earns-comm&keywords=wireless+indoor+security+camera&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B07RM6922G&pd_rd_r=6b0a6301-9aab-439b-b21c-ab8b48967af0&pd_rd_w=jXHRU&pd_rd_wg=bmmcR&pf_rd_p=b029c82c-aced-48fe-b955-08794dc4e3cd&pf_rd_r=VJK997SEWAY37FZY9RWJ&qid=1640229088&sr=1-6-a3cc9a7a-2f07-46dc-8259-ac02200376a0&tag=scoutedv2-20

I have had CCTV cameras in my house for years. I've been using Swann wired cameras for the most part with mixed emotions. But running new wires to upgrade the system just didn't excite me.I had been looking at NEST cams since I have the smart Thermostats and Smoke/Carbon-monoxide detectors for a while, but the price is ridiculous! Plus your only option with them is cloud service (an additional cost). Then I spoke with a neighbor who sent me a screen shot from his YI camera. I must say, the quality was pretty impressive.So I bought a four pack for $119.00 with moderate expectations. Let me tell you I'm super impressed with the picture quality of these cameras. Set up is quick and easy. When I purchased them I had no idea they had audio as well. The audio quality is incredible, plus it's a two way speaker. Purchased 32 GB SD cards for all of them so I didn't need to use cloud storage and it's been working great! I have them set to record all motion and I usually have about 7 days of history on each camera.Day and night vision are both spectacular IMO. I have attached several photos so you can see the quality both day and night. Side note, I have a couple ""indoor cams"" mounted outside. To do this I purchased a rubber sleeve/cover from Amazon to make the drop cam weather resistant for outdoor application. It's been through rain, sleet and snow with out issue so far. Link to cover: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FD5XHMP/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1A couple cons, the power cable is sooooooo short. I had to purchased longer cables for a couple of my installs. No biggie, they are only a few dollars here on Amazon. The app for iOS is very functional, but it has no multi camera view which would be a nice option.","So I have been using the Yi 1080p indoor camera system for 2 weeks now and I LOVE IT! The camera's are crystal clear during the day and are just as sharp in night mode. The added features of being able to hide any ""lights"" such as the blue power light and the typical red IR lights for night vision makes ""hiding"" these cameras a breeze. The playback function works great and give you the time in hours, minutes & seconds. The 2 way talk feature works great and has 2 modes, 1 is a push to talk feature where when you press the button you cannot hear what the person on the camera is saying and the 2nd is a continuous talk where you and the person on the camera can talk back and forth without pressing any buttons (love this feature) the 32gig on board storage is also a great bonus. Like I said I have been using the cameras for about 2 weeks and have barely used 3 gigs of space. (for an idea of the amount of traffic, it's just me, my wife and our 2 pets) so the cameras don't get a ton of action during the week. But are always recording on any motion. (I do not subscribe to the cloud storage as for I haven't seen a need) Anytime you get an alert it will store it on the app and you can upload it to your mobile device and share it with others. The initial motion detection clip is only 6 seconds, but if you wait till the end of the 6 seconds you will get an option to ""view entire motion"" which will bring up that camera, rewind to when it first detected the motion and play it back until there is no longer any motion, GREAT feature. All of the features seem to work as expected, you can set times for your camera to alert you when it detects motion and zones so that your dog walking around doesn't keep triggering the alerts. I can say the motion detection is VERY sensitive. You can set the setting to low, medium or high but really I can't tell a difference low to high. I have one camera facing out of my front window and it picks up shadows, car lights, leaves blowing, etc. Not a big deal, but on a windy day I can get a ton of alerts. The app works great, you can set a PIN or use your fingerprint to log into the cameras so in the event your phone is stolen, unless they have your PIN or fingerprint they will not be able to pull up your cameras. Connecting them was very simple and took less than 5 minutes per camera. Plug them in, scan the UR code and they will automatically connect to the network your phone is connected to. The packaging was very nice, didn't feel cheap. All cameras were individually wrapped along with all of the accessories. Comes with instruction booklet for assistance with installing/setup. The camera (black part) can be removed from the white base and mounted in different areas. They also sell (separately) wall mounts for the cameras. (cheap, like $10-$15 for a 4 pack) or you can stand them up anywhere you like (they have a round rubber grip on the bottom to help keep them from sliding around. All 4 cameras come with a USB cord and power brick. The USB cord is about 10-12 feet long so you should be able to place these cameras wherever you'd like. OK so I hope this rant...I mean review was helpful. If you're anything like me, I read all the reviews on a product before I make a purchase. Thanks for reading!***(I am not affiliated with Yi or any of there products, this was simple a consumer review, please purchase these at your own risk)***","I purchased the Yi 4 pk. 1080 Indoor security cameras. I was skeptical but am so glad I took the chance. I placed them in various windows facing outside as it’s outside I want to observe. They work perfectly during the day and, where the outside area is lit, at night. If the area is not lit, there is a reflection on the glass from the IR light, but they ARE designed to be indoor cameras. They work very well indoors, day and night, as intended. I have observed some sketchy people that have rung my doorbell when I’m not home (I have a camera in the window next to door), along with the neighbor’s cat, a family of raccoons, an opossum and numerous squirrels. I had an issue where they stopped alerting me of activity (which I see some others have had, also) and contacted Yi customer service. They promptly replied to my request and worked with me to make sure all my phone settings were correct. Turned out, the problem was with my phone settings, battery saver shutting down the app, NOT with the cameras or their app. I especially love that I can insert my own sd cards to save & view past events and not have to pay for ‘cloud’ subscription. I don’t know of another security camera that offers this. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase! In fact, I ordered another set of 4. If you are still in doubt, look up some reviews and comparisons of the Yi cameras on youtube.",,"Best Security Option for a home because:1. Its a one time charge- no monthly subscription- and all of the features of the camera work with the SD card2. The camera video is excellent especially the Night vision- it can see in almost complete darkness- wow3. The detection system is superb- I especially like that you can select an area within the total viewing area for detection. I use this feature so the cars that pass outside of my house do not trigger the alert only the area literally right in front of my door.4. The intercom is clear and at the appropriate volume5. Install and app use is seriously easy whether your a ""techy"" or not6. Small form and can be hidden without drawing attention7. Excellent price - for what you get its so worth it!8. Retrieve data on multiple device- My wife and I can both check our home and get the alerts simultaneously.9. Still records video on SD card even when wifi is out10. The option to make the camera stealth (no sound or constant blue light)As long as the camera and app lasts then I would definitely tell you do hesitate, buy it- its worth it and more.",25027,2,https://www.amazon.com/YI-Wireless-Security-Surveillance-Monitor/dp/B01CW4CEMS/ref=sxin_15?asc_contentid=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&asc_contenttype=article&ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B01CW4CEMS&cv_ct_cx=wireless+indoor+security+camera&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.4fefe955-6b33-485b-a709-b2ec28ffd6f4.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_we=asin&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source-earns-comm&keywords=wireless+indoor+security+camera&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B01CW4CEMS&pd_rd_r=6b0a6301-9aab-439b-b21c-ab8b48967af0&pd_rd_w=jXHRU&pd_rd_wg=bmmcR&pf_rd_p=b029c82c-aced-48fe-b955-08794dc4e3cd&pf_rd_r=VJK997SEWAY37FZY9RWJ&qid=1640229088&sr=1-2-a3cc9a7a-2f07-46dc-8259-ac02200376a0&tag=scoutedv2-20

And for those who need them to last longer buy the adapter to plug them in. It's stupid how these people come and review these as if they were 5000 dollar security set ups.

The motion detection feature allows you to choose sections of the room you want monitored. The night vision is provides good quality captures and we were surprised the battery life is rated for two years. However, please keep in mind that it could change base on how much you use the live view, how often it triggers to record, how long the duration of recording, is set to, and if your wifi signaling is bad.Note: if you have a large area or areas with lots of obstructions (i.e. cement, brick, steel, and aluminum) walls you may want to have a wifi meshed network to extend you wifi network pass these obstructions. We have the Google Nest Wifi system. Also, the blink camera must connect to the sync module via low frequency radio (LFR). Because of this, the camera must be within distance of the sync module. This is separate from your home wifi network. My suggestion is to get another syn-module if you run into issues where your single sync-module cannot cover all camera areas.","The all-new Blink Indoor – wireless, HD security camera appears to be a good product at a reasonable price. I bought a set of three that came with a Sync module. I believe up to 10 devices can be connected wirelessly to the Sync module that communicates using your home wifi.

IT'S ALIVE ! .... BHWAHAHAHAHAHA... IT'S ALIVE !,A good contender for home security.,"Stop searching for indoor/outdoor cameras, these are it and here's why!I tried 8 different camera brands and Arlo won. I wanted to make sure we got the right ones and I didn't want to pay for an expensive monthly service just to get a live view of my cameras. Arlo does not require you to pay for their monthly fee unless you want storage backup to view historical content, which is nice.The first set of cameras we tried were the Defender outdoor cameras CCTV - we had these backing up to a DVR which means that the cameras record footage 24/7 - even if internet is down. For outdoor cameras, that was an important feature for us, but if its not for you then the Arlo win hands down. When compared to Defender cameras, the Arlo have a much better picture quality, MUCH BETTER. The catch? You pay more for the Arlo. Since we got the Defender cameras first, I learned the hard way that I should have went with quality. Yeah, I saved $300 buying the Defender brand cameras the first time around, but I regreted it because when I viewed the cameras I could barely ascertain what was in the picture. In general I can see, but no details were noticable.We decided to get indoor cameras and for indoor cameras the Arlo are what we needed and more. Another thing I like is that if we ever decided to move them outdoor, they will work outdoor as well and we will not need to buy another camera. They run on rechargable batteries, so no need to run wires which is nice.The other indoor cameras we purchased the same time as the Arlo (and later returned) where as follows;Wainsview1. SereneLife Indoor Wireless IP Camera - HD 1080p - complete crap, did not even sync up to our internet. If it's a hassel to set up then I am moving on to the next camera. If you can't even make the set up process easy for the consumer, that sets the tone for everything else. No thanks.2. Amazon Cloud Cam Security Camera - I ordered this and then canceled it before it shipped, I was disspaointed when I read the reviews. I had high hopes since other Amazon products have been superior, not these cams. Sounds like they have some kinks to work out which they did not before they deployed to the user community. I think in the future these can improve, but here is a tip for Amazon Cam, go back to the table, kind the root cause of the issues, debug, UAT, deploy once you reach a level of quality. If Amazon worked out the issues that consumers are frustrated with then I would give it another try. Users want the ability to view their cameras LIVE without paying for a monthly service. Users also want the ability to store footage using their own storage devices, we don't want to pay for a monthly service (and the price always goes up for monthly service, always).3. Wansview Wireless 1080P Security Camera, WiFi - let me start off by giving this camera some credit, of all the cameras we tried, this one came the closest to the Arlo cameras (for indoor use only). What I loved about this cam was that it worked on WIFI and we had the option to hard wire to our home network. Another thing I loved was that it was like a robot and I could control if the camera moved up, down, left or right. I literallally had the ability to view every area of the living and kitchen without the need for multiple ""fixed"" view cameras. Sometime I have to put multiple cameras in a locatation so that I can get the entire view, this camera takes away that issue. Due to its flexability, you can put it in an open location and get the view of a general area which normally could require 3 fixed cameras just to get the full view. Another thing I loved is that I could change the lightness and contrast of the live feed whichw as awesome at different times of day and made the picture more clear. The last thing I LOVED about this camera was that I could use it as a 2 way voice, and a loudspeaker while I was away from home. You might be thinking, why do I need this feature? Believe me, I thought the exact same thing, until I needed it. Need to get your spouses or kids attention and they are not picking up their phone? Maybe you ordered pizza for them or have a package that needs a signature and you are watching your family on the camera while you are away and no matter how many times you call them to tell them to get the door, they cant hear you because their phones are on silent. That is when the 2 way audio speaker comes in handy, yell at them to get their attention to get the door, problem solved. I thought having a ring doorbell would make our lives easier, but, when someone is at the door and they press it, the only notification or sound to alert us, is sent to our phone via the Ring app, if you dont have your phone nearby, you will never hear any sounds that someone is at the door. So that was a problem. Anyways, after all the positive comments on this cam, why did the Arlo beat them? Simple, the Arlo application interface (phone app) is far superior, the ability to add multiple cameras much easier on Arlo. On the Wansview, I did love the camera, but we need multiple cameras in multiple areas of the house, it would not let us add the additional Wansview cameras we purchased (which is the review of camera #4 - Wansview Wireless Security Camera, 1080p). So we would have to open one app to view the Wansview cam and another app to view the other cameras, NOT REALISTIC. I want to view all my cameras on one application, with one click. I don't have time to look at Wansview cam and then open another app to view my other cameras. The user wants one place to view it all, not multiple, which means it is of high importance for the other Wansview cameras to sync up to the application without issue. When we got the other camera4. Wansview Wireless Security Camera, 1080p - nothing but problems trying to add them to the Wansview app. That is what blew it for Wansview. If you need just one camera, this one would work, but if you need more than one, that is the issue. Sad this one didnt work out.5. ISEEBELL Home Camera, Wi-Fi IP Indoor Security - the review for this one is more simple, Postive: Great Picture - Negative: Terrible App interface which continuously crashed and made it impossible to reply out. We returned them not because the picture quality was poor, but because the app to view the live feed completely sucked. Note to the manufacturer, the usability of the phone application which is used to view the live camera feed is just as important as the camera quality. Do not deploy your products to the market until the phone application kinks are worked out. Also, they did not offer a way to view live feeds online. When I am at work, I like to open a browser to view my life camera feed, I don't want to have to open my phone app each time when I have a desktop browser open. Many of these camera brands wont or dont have an option to do this. Guess who does? Arlo! Yes, Arlo has an awesome site, which I love, that allows me to view all my cameras from my laptop via my chrome browser. I love this feature!6. Fsmart wireless Indoor Home Camera Video - Positive: Great Picture, impressed with the picture for how cheap these are. They let you add a card to store video footage, HUGE cost savings which allows you to backup footage and doesn't require a monthly service fee (Arlo does not have this feature and that is a huge disappointment and area of improvement for Arlo to consider).7. Defender outdoor cameras - Positive: they work even when the internet is down and you can backup a month of 24/7 footage on the DVR that comes with the 8 camera package - no monthly service fees. Negative: Picture sucks bad and so does the phone app, the phone app seems like they put zero investment in improving, big let down.8. Arlo by Netgear indoor/outdoor cameras - The winner after comparing all of the above options. Why? Overall the two main important features was to have a good picture and reliable use of the phone app. The app has not crashed and is user friendly. The picture is clear and I love that. However, there is room for improvement and I hope Arlo listens to this advice. The camera market is getting competitive, so if you dont consider this advice, it might come back to bite you later on.Areas of improvement for Arlo:1. user wants the ability to insert SD card so they can backup certain amounts of footage without having to pay for your expensive monthly service2. user wants the ability to use some of the cameras as a 2 way radio - loudspeaker3. develop some cameras which have the ability to move, instead of all cams being fixed view. The user wants to have the option to at least move one camera up, down, left, right and have the camera use the same arlo application interface. Would be nice to have a camera with this option.4. Just invent an Arlo ""ring"" style doorbell - I will buy it. Ring irritates me bc I have to open their app and I dont want another app on my phone which is already at space capacity. Just get a doorbell and integrate that into the app interface so that when I check my house cameras I can see the front door cam. Would be nice.","I love this system! I have two houses in different countries and I can always see whats going on both of them. I use them also as a silent alarm. I like the wire free system and the versatile hangers for the cameras. The only issue with this system happens when you have a power shortage. If for any reason you get both your modem and the system off and then on, if your modem cant't pick the internet carrier before the arlo system reboots (which happens every time) then your arlo will stay offline. If arlo doesn't find an internet connection even though it was able to connect to the wifi, it just stop trying to connect to the arlos server thus the system is on but offline and without providing neither cameras nor the alerts. There's no way to reboot it again remotely. You will need to go directly to the base and manually turn it off and on. I solved the problem with a Wemo wifi ac switch connected to the arlo base station. Wemo switch keeps trying to connect to the internet until it succeed, then I can swicth off and on the arlo. For added security in my home overseas I connected a no break to the system.","I purchased and installed the system more than 3 months ago. Installation was easy (I bought the metal wall/ceiling brackets separately). Set up of the base station and linking of the cameras to the station took only a few minutes. Since placing the system into service, it has operated flawlessly! The cameras record events as soon as motion is detected. I have not had any issues with delayed recordings (as discussed in other reviews). I never miss the event. Most importantly, The videos are crystal clear. Also, I have not had “random” motion activations as others have reported but based on those reports I was very careful regarding where I mounted the cameras to ensure random movement (like a car going down the street) did not cause false recordings. Last, I am still using the original batteries installed more than 3 months ago with the battery life indicator showing all cameras with 3/4 or more REMAINING life. Love the system and it has exceeded all my expectations.","I researched ( and even bought ) security cameras for two years that were advertised as '' wireless '' and none of them met my needs..... until now. To the best of my knowledge, Arlo is the ONLY camera system that is COMPLETELY WIRELESS, which what I need(ed) . It is also refreshing to come across one of today's modern electronic marvels that ACTUALLY WORKS and works well, way beyond my expectations. Is Arlo the best possible solution for everybody? ... maybe not, but it works well, has sharp images and is super easy to set up. Download the app, follow the few simple instructions online and you're done. Frankly from my past experiences with wireless electronics, I was expecting to do a LOT of cursing and for once that wasn't the case.... and my puppy didn't have to hide in the other room ( Ha Ha Ha Ha ). Oh, and if you're worried about your mailman's images delivering your mail being "" out there "" on the web without your control, you've got more than just security problems, my friend.","I just got this delivered today. I ordered it because of a few odd things that have happened (and to catch the unknown neighbor leaving their dog-poop bag on my lawn) and to feel a little more secure when I'm not home. It's probably a little early for me to leave a fair and impartial review, but as of right now....I love this little camera.I did a significant amount of reviewing and searching and comparing before I made my purchase. I didn't over think but I didn't impulse buy either. I wasn't looking for some god awful ugly outdoor city street intersection design, nor was I looking for the ""black dome"" federal building cam. I also didn't want to run power cords over the eaves, down the molding, and through the house or be stuck with the only outdoor outlet location that I have. Wireless totally caught my eye, and if the batteries last longer than a couple months, then to me that is a huge win. That plus the sleek, adorable, sexy, slim design...ohhh-la-la!I was like a kid at Christmas when I opened the box. Included in the kit was (1) camera, (4) batteries, (1) hub, (1) power cord (1) ethernet cable, (2) magnetic mounts with screws, start up directions.I am not and IT wiz, but I can hold my own. This set up was SO easy. I will say this....I had a friend here who kept my package-opening-excitement in check. He told me ""follow the directions exactly as they tell you"". Ok,, I could have easily jumped and gone out of order. If I did would there have been a problem? I can't say but I did read other reviews where some had difficulty. I had none. Plug in, wait for the hub to connect to the wifi, while that was happening start my online account, sync, and away we go! I have all Apple products and I did not have any download or viewing problems or any need for add on software.For now I have the default set on ""optimum"" to see how the battery life does with the video quality and 80% sensitivity.Video quality. Clear, true color, and bright. There is a zoom option when viewing from my phone. Yes, in zoom at the current settings it can get a bit grainy. I wouldn't be getting this to read serial numbers on dollar bills going into a cash register, but for what I was looking for, I am impressed. I tested the night vision camera going down to the basement and I think it's great. Like I said, no serial numbers on bills, but you can definitely see what it is that your looking at. (While writing this the notification banner keeps popping up. The bugs by the porch light are doing a jig triggering the camera. I will keep this in mind when I find the best mounting place.)Currently I don't have it mounted on it is on my front porch railing (don't try to come steal it, I will see you!!!). I have a porch light and front yard pole light that are on all night. I have already checked the quality of the viewing. Porch light on or off doesn't change it much. I'm thrilled.Motion detection. As mentioned, I don't have it mounted yet and it is at mid-drift level. I don't think it is at the best location to say one way or another how well the detection is. From what I can tell already is that you have to keep in mind where it is located an what you think it will trigger. From my porch to my driveway where a car would normally park is about 25 - 30 feet and about 60 feet to the road. It might not pick up the movement of a car coming in but if someone walks up the walkway it will.I ordered the ""stick"" mount for it. That will be here tomorrow. Once I have that I am going to take the time to test which mount I will use and the location for the best viewing and motion detection.Notifications. I have it set up for email and banner alerts. When motion is detected, a banner alert (like a text message) will pop up (settings depending on your phone). It immediately starts the camera to record. There is a red light on the camera indicating that it has been triggered. I have it set for 120 seconds of recording time. Once it is done recording it will send you an email notification which proves a link for viewing. Since this is coming from the ""cloud"" it takes 2 minutes recording time plus another say 30 seconds for the email. You can view real time once the banner alerts you. It seems like there is a little lag in connecting, but I was doing it all on my home wifi at the same time. It will be interesting to see if that lag goes away when I'm away from the house on 3G or other internet.I will update this in a week or so with new findings. But as of right night I AM VERY VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE. If you are looking to solve crimes or protect Fort Knox, this might not be your best choice and I'm sure there are higher priced more technical cameras out there to buy. But you you want a good quality, modern, completely wireless FREE viewing home safety/surveillance camera for added comfort, then this is a very good buy.",4006,1,https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Wireless-Security-Detection-Included/dp/B00QH0Q8J4/ref=sr_1_36?keywords=wireless+indoor+security+camera&qid=1640229100&sr=8-36

Amazing Quality, Excellent Night Vision",Way cheaper then a security system alarm and in some ways better.,Better than Nest!,Love these cameras!,Great security cameras!,"WOW! Highly impressed. We purchased these cameras to install outside our house for that added protection of audio and video surveillance.The video/picture/audio quality are great! I haven't experienced any issues at all with quality! The night vision is by far the greatest I have seen in wireless cameras. The night vision has perfect clarity and no distortion at all! It works just as good at night as it does in day light.The motion detection works really well for us. We went through the initial setup and chose the preferences that worked best for what we were wanting. You can even set zones so you don't have any unnecessary recordings or alerts!The battery life is also really good, like crazy good, at least for us anyway. They last about 3 to 4 months. What we have done is kept a backup battery that is fully charged for each device, that way when we charge the batteries, we don't have to worry about any of our Ring Devices not working.The Cams integrate flawlessly with Alexa as do all Ring Products. I have seen the quality of other Ring competitors and they don't stand up even close to the quality that the Ring Cameras or other Ring Products produce.If you are looking for great quality, and a product to perform as it is intended to do, then look no further than Ring. Ring truly does live up to it's expectations!","For the price you can’t beat what you are getting. Wide angle shot, motion sensor activation, and the battery life is unreal.Bought two of these and a wired doorbell camera during Amazon Prime Day sale and we are beyond impressed. We have an alarm system and the install fee alone to hook into the system was more than 10 times the cost of the two pack of cameras.Pros:Battery life in unreal. We can hook up a solar charger but why? The one gets a lot of motion and we charged it for the first time after 4 months at 18% battery life. The other gets motion but not really that much and we charged for the first time after 7 months at 6%.Notifications in your phone. Could be better. Almost instant, but you aren’t going to be able to catch the delivery man and the video takes 30-60 second to load. But it is on a continuous loop so it shows about 4-5 seconds before the motion sets it off.Live view is great. Awesome picture day and night. Easy to watch the kids playing outside or keep an eye out for the delivery man. Can’t keep it on all the time but for a few seconds it’s good. You don’t need to be on your network to watch who’s there.Support (we bought ring protect) chat and call options we had a connection problem and they were amazing on the phone and fixed it within 4 mins of making the call. Best part is if someone steals the camera they will replace it under the ring protect.ConsUnless someone rings the doorbell you aren’t going to catch the delivery man. It’s just a hair too slow.Wireless signal has to be decent for it to work. You may need a repeater or extender. And by decent I don’t mean awesome but if you can get on the internet on your phone in that spot the camera will work.Pro and con - Zeroing in the motion sensor takes a little time. Everything can set this off till you get it zeroed in, but once you do it will pick up only what you want to see. It can tell humans from animals so it doesn't kill the battery. For instance out doorbell is wired so we have a liberal motion setting. Instead of the cat that runs past the door at 4:30 am it was two cat sized raccoons!!!!Overall 8 months in we are impressed and are going to add two more of these bad boys. The ring protect insurance will cover all of them for one price so I am not worried about longevity but think that it shouldn’t be an issue.I rated motion detection at 4 but it’s more like 4.5 only because it really is annoying until you get it dialed in...","2 years ago my wife came home from work and I told her to come look. I was on our Nest Camera dashboard. As we watched, a car turned into our driveway. She asked,""Who is that?"" I told her, ""Its you, 1 minute and 23 seconds ago."" Due to the delay of the Nest server and since we had a new Ring Doorbell I went Ring Solar for outdoors.BEST CHOICE EVER!! We live in the High Desert where there is PLENTY OF SUN and I have 3 Ring Solar Outdoor cameras and and a Ring doorbell.Love them so much,I just ordered 3 more and a lighted Ring sign directly from RING because of the 1 camera limit here on Amazon plus they were cheaper directly from RING which BTW is owned by Amazon.I set all my cameras to detect ""persons only"" around my yard and set the range to the edged of my driveway because I don't need passing car motion alerts or alerts when our dogs are out to potty.With solar lights on every fence panel from https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XJHND3T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and solar lights on the front entry, driveway and gate entries from here https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XNS4SV1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1Our home and property says ""Go break into somebody else's house, we're protected!!",These Ring cameras were perfect for our shops security system. I was able to easily download the app on my i phone and get notifications when motion is detected-I can also snooze the alarm if I know someone will be walking around the area for a while so my phone isn't constantly going off. I charged them the first day about a month ago and have not had to charge the battery yet which I was worried about originally. Great picture and recording quality. I am able to talk to my dad through the speaker when he's at work later than he should be and tell him to go home hehe. I like being able to watch and make sure my father who is getting older is okay when he gets to work before we open and stays well past when we close. It also helps me to know when a customer comes in the front door if I am in the back helping the technicians. It also connected to my apple watch so I am able to get notifications that way as well. I am considering buying them for my house because I love them so much. I have also checked the photo quality at night time and it's pretty darn clear-I'd definitely recommend this camera.,"I got these to replace some cheapo $40 cameras I had bought from Amazon. They were ok and did the job but I just wasn't that happy with them. I was looking at going with Nest but they are just crazy expensive, $200 or more per camera?!?! I had four cameras total and that was still $40 cheaper than just one Nest cam. But, you do get what you pay for. Those took forever to connect on the app, their desktop app didn't even work at all and were powered by USB ( at least the ones inside) which made me have to use an extension cable and have ugly cables going everywhere. I thought I'd give these cameras a try since they were battery powered. I was a little concerned since they weren't recording 24/7 but after actually using them, it's not that big of a deal. The motion detection works pretty good and the fact that you can view live video almost instantly is great (the cheapo cameras took FOREVER to connect). Plus, the video quality and field of view is fantastic. I'm sure the more expensive cameras probably have a better field of view but honestly, these are great for the money. I am extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend this camera if you're looking for the middle ground camera (better than the cheap Chinese cameras but not as expensive as those $250+ cameras), also has the benefit of being wireless. Oh and on that, I've had them installed with some pretty heaving motion detection and have gone down only 6% for the cameras outside over two weeks and the inside cameras 10% (a lot more activity).",6143,183,https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Stick-Up-Cam-Battery-HD-security-camera-with-two-way-talk-Works-with-Alexa-2-Pack/dp/B07RM5BVVR/ref=sr_1_35?keywords=wireless+indoor+security+camera&qid=1640229100&sr=8-35

Great Product.,"""3TB HDD Pre-Instal - Hiseeu Wireless Security Camera System, 8CH 1080P NVR 4Pcs Outdoor/Indoor WiFi Surveillance Camera with Night Vision, Waterproof, Motion Alert, Remote Access"" model WXKIT-8HB611-1T.**I will only try to point out some things not discussed in the description andFirst this is an EIGHT CAMERA system so don't be confused by the ""4pcs"" in the description.Second, I sent an email question to their customer service and received a response in less then 24hrs - VERY GOOD.Third, this is a Standalone system running Linux which gets rid of the BLOATWARE/SNIFFING of Windows and Chrome, etc. 'nuf said on my opinions of Goggle and Microsoft.Second, BUY the system with ALL the cameras (8 max) so that you have 'Spares"" bought cheap as a 'kit.' I have used 6 in my system to date. The Camera Software has display settings for 8 camera windows, 6, 4, and so on.Third, the Cameras housing, adjustment arm and base are 'cast metal' (not plastic) very well made. I specifically chose ones with good 'hoods' as several of my units would be hit by the sun and typically would bleach out the image.Forth, the camera's field of view is very good and clarity range is as far as it shows. There is no flutter in the images after 4 months installed. The automatic 'white balance' is the best I have seen on NUMEROUS systems including Commercial versions. This comes into play when it goes B/W for night vision. On that note, there is a 'electric eye' on the front that actually switches the Camera mode too which does NOT rely on software to make that determination and uses decades old established 'eye' tech for delay - i.e. doesn't switch back & forth and does not get effected by passing headlights etc. This is the BEST manner in my opinion and you can actually HEAR the switch when you cover the eye with your finger!Fifth, the NIGHT VISION of the camera is exceptional for a non-commercial unit. It uses THREE ""infra-red illuminator"" LEDs (shown in picture) that are very strong (bottom ""led"" is actually the electric eye). The 65 feet is correctly advertised. However there is a hotspot because the LEDs are not shining 'spread out' as far as camera's field of view. This is an issue with ALL infra-red Iluminators as the Infra-red light is such a small band of light energy - that's why your TV remote does not work from a distance or if you don't point it at the TV when your batteries are low. If you need to see further or wider, you will need to invest in separate ACTUAL Infra-Red Iluminators and place them as needed. Note that I have overlapping cameras and each 'see' the others Infra-Red spots.Sixth, Make a CAMERA MAP and plot locations as well as which camera goes where. The system comes FULLY SET UP however, having done this before, I plugged in the entire system on a table, started it up and determined which cameras were 1-8 and LABELED them. Then made sure to put them in the order I wanted them DISPLAYED so when turned it all on, it was only the matter of alignment. I have three in one location alone giving over 180 degree coverage. Those are 150ft away from the base unit and still have a SOLID 3 of 4 bars wifi.Last, I did not need any internet connections (etc.) so have no input there.PS. the noise is typical of just a Hard Drive head indexing and is not loud but it will transfers through its cabinet to a hard surface and becomes a 'sounding board' making it out to be louder than it actually is, which you can fix by putting some soft 'feet' on it. The intermittent indexing does make sleeping around it a little funny. The best step would be to offer SSD when the prices come down as they are noiseless and have a better longevity in a constant ""write"" hard derive scenario such as this.","So, let's review, right?Well, when I bought it, of course the price was right, but I was worried that It was on the cheap side, and that it might reflect in the quality. The answer is NO. This was well worth the value. After 2 years, still working just fine.Now, Let's talk about it.Basically, it's pretty easy. Unwrap everything. Grab a network cable, a power strip, and a HDMI or VGA monitor.Once you have those things, plug it all in. DVR to the network, power and HDMI/VGa and a mouse (included but crap), and the cameras all in to the power strip. Turn it all on at once.When everything is on, the cameras should already show up on the screen in a grid. You have to set a password (make it easy, no keyboard). Then walk through the Wizard. Set the time, give it an IP or DHCP (easy instructions included)**. When it says ONLINE, you are done. You can tweak it anyway you want, but honestly, that's about it.There's also a QR code that it displays to download the app for mobile access, and there is one that connects the DVR to your phone. I dowloaded the iPhone app, then clicked 'add DVR' then pointed my phone to the QR code... and in about 5 seconds, the phone showed my cameras.** If you have a router that supports uPNP, use it. It will make things easier.The reason I am posting a review now is because of a recent issue I had. I came home one night to find the DVR had been stuck in a reboot. It would load the startup screen, then reboot. After an EMAIL to their SUPPORT, I was given some options to reset a setting, reboot, and try again. This didn't work, so they sent me a new firmware. That corrected the problem, and I was back online.In many cases, a company would simply tell me that 2 years was over-warranty. I really appreciated that they were able to provide support.I should mention, they do not speak fluent english, so there was a little assumption and muddling I had to go through to understand some of the instructions, but overall. Very impressed.","I ordered this system last year and to my shame it sat in the box till now. I've had a lot of time to do my pet projects and this was one of them. So finally I got it out and after reading reviews of how wireless camera systems were difficult to setup I was dreading the fight. However, no fighting needed. I hooked it up to the tv and plugged it into 120VAC. I plugged in the cameras to 120VAC in different parts of my house in window locations. I then turned on my tv and switched to the HDMI port of the Control Unit of the system. Once again to my surprise I saw my screen divided into squares for each camera powered up. I didn't fight with it at all! Apparently the system is automatically keyed to recognize its cameras and any extra cameras you try connect to the system must be wired. It is still early in my installation and I am trying things out yet. I ran an ethernet cable to the Control Unit and will be trying out accessing from my phone and computer. It looks like you can manually access it over the internet if you know the IP Address and ports of cameras or you can download the software app and use the software to access cameras and schedule recording. I would recommend this system.","I purchased this system recently for my property,At first I was a little hesitant buying a system off Amazon, but then did my due diligence research on the system and Hiseeu as well as tried asking some pre-sale questions to their support to see how efficient support really was. (They did a great job of answering questions)I have been pleasantly surprised with the system as a whole.Setup was very easy as the cameras come preloaded to match the system.

Only negative is that when operating the camera movement remotely, it does make a semi loud noise (for a dog at least). She hears it move and it sets her off barking lol.

Great Buy,"So far, so good",Great value for the money,Work's well,Works as promised and was easy to install,"For the money, this is an outstanding camera system. Very easy to set up and the wireless range to the NVR is impressive. The Day image is very good and the night image is good to about the recommended distance. (65 ft) I can see well beyond that just not enough detail to make out a face without additional lighting. I have two cameras that are easily 75 feet away through 2 walls, 1 an exterior brick wall and I still have 4 of 5 bars of signal. I have one camera application that required one of the 2 included extension antennas to get it up to 4 bars. I will also admit that I tried 4 different NVR locations before settling on the best spot. One of the spots I thought this would do quite well (Very centralized and higher than most of the cameras) ended up giving a very poor signal on a few of the cameras, which were actually fairly close. Box and antenna position does make quite a difference. I tested my cameras to work and pair with the box and then placed them in the approx locations I wanted them. I then moved the box to different locations to see where it would work best. The nice thing about the wireless system is I only have to run data cables from the NVR to the router. The cameras require local power but this was no issue for me as I had either lighting fixtures, which I was able to use adapters on or outlets close to all 8 mount locations.","It has been a month and is working great. One camera died in the first week but they promptly replaced it.If you can set up a wireless router, then you will have no problems with setting up this system, most of the settings are automatically updated for you. I love the 4 gb storage... i got footage for weeks before it overwrites.",In my case I am trying to handicap this review because I am comparing this $300 camera system to a nearly $3000 camera system we use at work.Obviously the system I use at work is amazing however you must take Price into consideration.This does have motion tracking and it supposed to detect humans however it thinks anything that moves including a tree branch is a human.All in all set up was easy just plug in the cameras pointing the antenna straight up and it does the rest.The quality of the image is pretty good.You can definitely see who is outside when you’re looking through these cameras.The mobile app works well and you can login and see it from anywhere in the world.Tech-support is amazing.,"It is easy to install all the cameras and the whole setup, however best if you have a spare monitor to use with this system. I have had this for over 4 months and it works well. The cameras have a great range on them. I have a couple cameras that are 150-160ft from the main unit and work perfect. They even go thru one wall. I have another one that has to go thru several walls, probably about 60ft away and it loses connection, occasionally, but not bad. It is great to be able to go back to a certain day and time and locate a person or delivery very easily. I still have not learned everything, have had to contact customer service a few times. She knows alot, but for me is somewhat hard to understand. The only negative that I have found is the motion feature does send quite a few false alarms, even when you set the camera on the least sensitive setting, and block out areas where trees might blow, etc. If you rely on this to notify you when you are away, you may get quite a few wake up text alerts. Overall this is a great system, especially for the money.","Upgraded from my previous unsupported DIY 4 camera NVR setup. After some research, I found this OHWOAI system that met all my criteria. To my surprise it is capable of 2-way audio so I purchased a separate set of 4 speakers to use this function and was still under-budget. Installation was simple, and everything worked out of the box as advertised. Definitively easier than my previous DIY experiences. The mobile app worked great on my iPhone 7S, and the video playback and export worked without problems. Audio quality (on the speakers) is low, but sensitivity is very high. Video quality and wireless range are very good. I couldn't be more happy with my purchase, since it surpassed my expectations without breaking my budget.",440,71,https://www.amazon.com/Security-Wireless-Pre-Install-OHWOAI-Surveillance/dp/B07VHLQ57C/ref=sr_1_31?keywords=wireless+indoor+security+camera&qid=1640229100&sr=8-31

Because I already have Ring cameras it’s worth it to pay a little more over a Wyze cam.","In February, I noticed my ADHD medication ran out early. I’m very careful about taking it exactly as prescribed so it was strange that I had run out 10 days early. For reasons I won’t get into for this review, I suspected the property manager of my building was stealing it. Obviously that sounded crazy, but I couldn’t think of another explanation. A friend suggested a Ring camera, so I bought one never expecting anything to actually come of it. I put some antihistamines in my now empty pill bottle thinking no one would ever take them, set up the camera when it arrived, and felt more secure knowing it was there. Set up was simple so I figured worst case scenario, I was out a bit of money and I spent maybe 10 minutes setting it up.Fast forward a week later when I get a notification via the app that there was motion detected on my camera. I open up the recording and there she is, entering my apartment, going right for my decoy pills, taking them, and leaving. I immediately left work to get back home. I called the police who sent an officer. I showed him the video and he admitted that had I not had the video, he wouldn’t have believed me. I was able to quickly and easily send the video to the police and to the president of the company that owns my building. I also was able to download the video and get it uploaded so that I have copies of it as I go through the next few months as she (hopefully) gets brought to justice.I cannot emphasize how much this little camera has helped me. I would not have caught my burglar otherwise. Because of it, they were able to look up records of who used their electronic key to access my apartment and she had been in there 7 times over the month prior. This would have gone on for longer and who knows if it would have resulted in harm to myself or my cat had I not caught her. This camera has given some of the sense of security she stole from me back and stopped a nightmare situation from worsening. I will still be recovering from this for long time and I am hoping she is brought to justice, but I cannot thank Ring enough for helping me secure my home from an unexpected source of danger.","This camera for $60 is a solid deal.

You must take the time to fit it to your particular home or location,"Weird brand name, Amazing product.",Great quality security system,Affordable and Smart/Wifi&APP,Easy to set up and great for a medium size house,"This is a long review but worth the read if planning on purchasing an OOSSXX WIFI based camera system. The initial setup and function test of the camera system took maybe 15 to 20 mins at the most and everything worked great right out of the box. Before purchase I read all the reviews and came to one strong conclusion that the system is good quality but the people installing it did not quite understand how WIFI works. It seems many just don’t understand how critical it is to place the NVR in the optimum place that fits your particular home. It literally took me almost a week to play around and find the proper place. This NVR system is 1080P so yeah it needs a good signal connection to the camera to maintain the data rates for that high-quality image. What I have found is that if you don’t have a minimum of 3 of the 4 signal bars then your connection will not be good enough to prevent the camera to drop off on and off briefly during the day. First step is to place, tie wrap or tape the cameras in the place you would like them to be after doing the initial system setup and test to make sure they are working properly. Make sure to connect them with a bunch of long extension cords so you can move them as necessary for better signal later. Once your cameras are all placed the system is powered up you need to find the best location for your NVR. A couple of hints to finding the proper location. In the software go to System Setup -> Network Setup -> WIFI Setup. Here is where it will make or break your happiness with the system. If you look off to the right side you will see the signal for all your installed cameras. If it is not above 35 on any camera that camera will have issues. It will function and record between 30 and 35 but you will see brief 1 to 2 second drop-offs that are worse at night when night vision is on. So here is how to find the best location for the NVR. I have a WIFI extender for my house WIFI that I plugged the NVR ethernet cable into as I bounced around the house outlet to outlet with a spare monitor and power strip to look for the best spot. As you go spot to spot in your house click on the Adaptive channel button on the bottom of the WIFI page refresh the cameras to check signal and click Apply once you discover the best channel for that location. You would be amazed just by changing the channel it increased the number by +5 or so in the exact same location. Actually, for the final location and the channel with the highest strength in my home one of my cameras would not connect at all. I went to the camera and changed the antenna position just a bit and just like that it came back to life with good signal. In your case you may have one or two cameras that are low while the others are high. Try moving the camera location a bit or try the repeater setup to connect them to a camera with a stronger signal and see if it helps. If still no good contact tech support and/or purchase an oossxx repeater to boost them up a bit and check out YouTube videos that can help you get it setup. For my particular case I did not need a separate repeater but used the built-in repeater function in the system and it worked perfect. I also did not need the NVR constantly attach to a TV or monitor so the NVR ended up on a table in a room. I use the app and remote access for my needs and when I need access to the system, I drag over the spare monitor make my changes and then put it away again. I am very happy with the system and the image quality both day and night. Scrolling through the playback of images is simple. I originally purchased a 4-camera setup and have ordered two additional cameras to complete my needs. Once they are all up and running I will setup the alerts. With all this said there are a few areas OOSSXX could improve on. The mouse cable is ridiculously short and the include 10ft antenna did nothing to improve signal as I was setting up my system. It actually made it worse. These little things are not enough to discourage your purchase but wish list things for improvements for the next revisions. Like any piece of tech equipment, it is easy to blame the equipment. If I had left the NVR in the first place, I put it I would not have been happy at all but with a little patience and setup on my part to match the particular setup of my home I became very pleased and would definitely recommend purchase.","Ill start by saying I have installed several different DVR and NVR systems. This system was by far the easiest install I have had, and the best looking. Wireless systems appear to be hit or miss when it comes to pairing the cameras with the NVR. These camera's came pre-installed, and as soon as I gave them power they popped right up. The picture quality is great and the settings are easy to navigate. I was mainly the IT guy with my camera installs, and was around to port forward and get the cameras online to be viewed anywhere you had internet. The system did it all for me. It just worked. I didn't have to port forward or any other voodoo magic. I was skeptical when I saw that the app ""IP PRO3"" that they tell you to download had 3.3 stars on Android, and 2 stars on Iphone. Don't worry, it appears 90% of the low ratings are user error, not the app. The app works great and I have had no issues with it.I'm recording 24/7 so I can't grade the motion detection, and nothing broke, or didn't work so I can't grade the tech support either. But the camera's have been on and recording for a week, no problems. With the 2TB system and 4 cameras, you should get about 25-30 days of stored video for each camera.Do yourself a favor and buy the OOSSXX system.UPDATE: The issue I was having with the ""Pairing the wireless camera's was due to a faulty camera. It began shutting off and needed to be power cycled, until the day it died completely. I got ahold of OOSSXX who had me complete some trouble shooting steps, and send them pictures. It was pain free and in the end they replaced the camera for me. I have had no other issues with the system, and just ordered a PTZ camera from them to fit to the system.","Cameras works very well, It’s exactly what we looking for our home security system. We been missing packages to house, so we need to find out what’s happened. It’s very easy install, I have to gave credit to the wireless feature. I had wire security system before, it’s so much work to installed them. And damaged the house wall. This one is perfect. I installed in less an hour. I have to buy monitor separate, but this still great deal with the price. I would like to have more wide range of the sight but it still great. It have great picture quality. We been use it for over last months. After it all install, we felt much more safe. And our packages haven’t miss since the camera installed. It’s a great investment.","My bike has been stolen recently from the backyard. When I checked my home security cameras, I was surprised that none of the cameras were recording. Thus, I decided to replace my old surveillance system. OOSSXX seems to meet my needs well. I bought the one which comes with 2TB HDD hard drive and 4 1080p cameras. The installation is quite easy, just need to mount these cameras on the wall and have the power adapter plugged in. Cameras will be able to transfer footage through Wifi. It comes with 10 ft internet cable, but I wish they come with a longer one. So far, I've been using it for days and don't see any issue with the footage or any latency. These cameras seem to be solid. and legit. The system UI is functional but too boring. With the motion detector, I could get an immediate notification through the APP and email. I'm happy with what I paid and got. This is an affordable solution for basic home security.",,838,223,https://www.amazon.com/Antennas-Enhanced-Detected-Wireless-Surveillance/dp/B0796R2LCG/ref=sxin_15_trr_7161092011_7?cv_ct_cx=wireless+security+camera+system&keywords=wireless+security+camera+system&pd_rd_i=B0796R2LCG&pd_rd_r=bebc75bb-9025-4692-b62a-e69f95cb33e8&pd_rd_w=IghQT&pd_rd_wg=ovsoE&pf_rd_p=4d8c4287-5cf4-4061-b040-4022cf74abab&pf_rd_r=A79BAEJAZFGCNBVBHS92&qid=1640229059&sr=1-8-5519553e-2baa-451e-af83-b0156e5c6669

I looked into getting one large system, but it is very expensive and we didn't need every feature for every area. Why pay for something we don't need? So while it may not be conventional, having different systems works well for us. This is the largest system we have bought, because these are for the perimeter of our home.Another reason we opted for this system is that it did not have a hard drive. That may seem strange to specifically look for that, but my BIL is a computer genius. Not exaggerating...dude has patents and can even be found on YouTube. He was able to save us a lot of money by putting together the hard drive himself and it's way more high end.This package includes 4 wireless cameras that offer motion alert, floodlight, color night vision, and audio.Again, these are for the perimeter, so being able to listen is all we needed. No need to actually have to talk back, because there is no point of entry in those areas.I think it's really cool that the night vision is in color and not some harder to see black and white picture.We can view on a smartphone, tablet, computer, laptop or simply a monitor. It is set up to view on hubby's tablet, my phone, and a monitor that BIL set up.Hubby and I physically attached the cameras where we wanted them, but my BIL did the rest of the setup. We spent about 10 minutes per camera and that's primarily because ladders and stuff was involved. BIL was able to do the whole system on his end in like 10 minutes. Not 100% sure how he set it up.I can say our home is well protected with cameras, the picture is super clear, the sound is crisp, and if anything comes near our cameras the lights go off and we get alerted. We live in a good area, but still want to protect our home and family.","Super nice quality security system. Easy to install and operate. Comes with 4 HD quality cameras that all have a clear video feed. Hooked it up to my monitor and can watch all four feeds at once or zone in on just one for a larger view. Comes with a clear easy to understand manual that explains everything as well. Has built in microphones, so you have audio at all times.Best part is the app, you can view from anywhere using this and it has features like photo capture and video saving. Great price for such good equipment, highly recommend this set!",Funciona muy bien aunque la sincronizacion es algo lenta pero esta muy bien,This camera system gives me comfort in knowing I can work the night shift and not have to worry about being robbed!

It has been totally re-engineered. Take it from someone who owns all the different cameras Blink had to offer since day one and had to get on a waiting list to get the very first one. So, I should know what iam talking about. This new camera no longer has the push down and pull system to open the back to install batteries. It has a large screw that you simply unscrew with a included tool to open the back of the camera which is really nice. Once you open the back and install the included batteries scan the small QR code inside the camera threw the blink app it will scan to find the camera once that is done it will automatically do a firmware update. After that you are ready to install your new blink camera. Also noticed the sound is much louder and more clear then the other cameras. This is good if two people are talking in a low voice you can hear what they are saying. Has brighter clearer night vision. Nice clear voice communication with two way talk. Alot stronger wifi signal to sink module and from sink module to camera. Sharp, clear, bright, and colorful HD vision during the day. I noticed before I wrote this review that some people only gave this camera 2 or 3 stars. Like the guy who is complaining about software issues. Well if you follow the directions you would not have that problem. Let the camera finish its firmware update. Duh ! Also, if you have been a Blink customer for a while and want to add this camera to your current system. You do not have to pay for cloud storage you are grandfathered in. After you add this camera to your existing system it will actually tell you this ! The front of the camera has a all new face with a very smooth and shinny surface iam sure to help combat the weather and give it a more high tec look. Their is no longer a switch inside the camera to turn on or off the blue recording light located on the front of the camera. It's is all done threw the app which is really nice as well. They really did a good job in re-engineering this camera and listened to customer complaints about their past cameras and went threw and fixed every issue. I would definitely buy this camera again ! UPDATE : 09-25-20 After using this camera for a couple of days. And as other reviewers have noted that this camera only has a 25 foot motion trigger ! Anything further than 25 feet it will NOT record when motion is present. So if you need a camera get the Blink XT2 for the further range. This camera will only be good for specific areas like door or window that are within the 20 to 25 foot range from the camera.","It's super easy. Works great. Setup was simple. It works exactly as advertised. What I didn't know for sure is that the batteries are just high quality AA batteries. So when they die, you can get some rechargeable ones and just rotate them through the thing. I'm going to order a couple more. They are pretty great. *Edit-A nice person took the time to let me know it's best not to replace w/ traditional AA batteries.","So far everything is as advertised. Setup was a breeze and the image quality is great - especially when set to “best.” I really appreciate the custom activity zones that you can set, as well as the ability the turn off the led light.In terms of improvement, the included mount is pretty basic. For better or worse the mount snaps into the back of the camera module. This makes installing it relatively easy, but also means anyone could detach it with a firm pull. I’ve noticed that there are upgraded mounts that you buy, but haven’t had a chance to fully check those out yet.Lastly, I noticed another reviewer mentioned subscription pricing, but it’s a bit misleading. Yes, there is cloud storage that you can pay for, but there are multiple levels, including a free plan, as well as a basic plan for $3/month. Also, the paid plans don’t start until 2021. More importantly, What this camera has, that the XT2 doesn’t, is local storage. If you’re big on privacy, and don't want to store videos on the cloud, you can attach a USB drive to the blink module and save your videos there (see photo which shows the usb drive). There’s no fee for saving your videos locally - you can still get alerts and watch your video feed live for free.",What an awesome product...total install took 25 minutes. I put 3 camera’s up outside to monitor my summer home. One of the camera’s I places on a pole in the yard pointing at the roof so I can monitor snow fall and snow melt roof system. The app was friendly. I shared the app with my wife and she was up and running in 2 minutes with minimal effort.

This will need to be done for each individual camera. After that everything works quite nicely. May be a bit difficult for the non tech-savvy.",,,5,3,https://www.amazon.com/Expandable-ANNKE-Wireless-Surveillance-Detection/dp/B08YR3BXBL/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=wireless+security+camera+system&qid=1640229059&sr=8-7

I originally purchased the Blink camera system because I was thrilled with having month long battery life and the tiny profile cameras I could mount in the corner of my room.They served me well for a time, but like many people I began having major privacy concerns when Amazon purchased them. Eufy's camera systems are different. No footage is uploaded to the cloud and instead all of your video lives locally on your device. Eufy claims it is encrypted, but I wish they would specify if their employees have any way to ever access the footage or not. Some clarification on the privacy end of things would help further set them apart from Blink and their other competitions.I decided to take a chance on the Eufy 2C after having an amazing experience with Eufy's video doorbell.I'm so glad I did! The cameras are low profile and blend in easily in corners or even just mounted to walls. The base station is quite small and looks right at home next to my router, and the app works instantly with no headache. The cameras have crisp video and audio and Eufy provides easy-to-follow instructions for mounting. I do wish the mounts were magnetic or had a way to quickly remove the cameras for charging. Thankfully, after several days I haven't gone down a single tick in battery life so I am hopeful charging will be few and far between. Notably missing is Homekit support and expandable storage, but Eufy promises us that both of these features are coming soon. They seem to have a good track-record for customer service so I am hopeful.Below I will provide some pros/cons but to be honest none of the cons are dealbreakers, just things I hope Eufy will consider for their next software updates and product iterations.This is the best security camera system I have ever used and one of the simplest setups as well. I can't recommend this product enough! Go buy it!Pros:-GREAT video quality-Spotlight functionality-Seamless App and great wireless range-Good installation instructions-Battery life/USB charging-RTSP (record to your network or NAS!)-Clear audio & 2/way audio-Good nightvision performance-Recording light-Built-in sirens on each camera and homebase-AI detection means my pets don't set off the cameras (THANK-YOU!)Cons:-No HomeKit Support-No Geofencing (Auto arm on leaving and disarm on arrival)-16GB/ No way to expand storage with USB or SD (yet)-Mounts are cumbersome, magnetic would be a lot easier to remove for charging-No way to re-arrange order of cameras in the app","Overall I got this over the Arlo system. Price of the immediate purchase and since no monthly fee it was a no brainer. I did. I two sets 2c and Eufycam 2. I needed two hubs to reach my backyard and front corner of my house. About the furthest two points from each other. Hub range could be better as it has trouble going through walls.Clarity is goodDetection is about 90%. I think it may require time to ‘settle’. For example I setup and kept walking in front of it and it did t go off for a day. Was about to return when it started working. So do give it a chance. Start with all motion and high sensitivity, and go down from there or switch to human mode.The light is triggered manually. If I really cared I would have taken off a star but I don’t need that feature.Note the 2c has a siren but only for alerts. The Eufycam 2 has a siren for tampering which is nice. Haven’t tested either siren.Charge it up when you receive. I started at 40% out of the box but it dropped quick. Again almost returned it. But I charged to 100% and it’s been fine since then.There is only motion and human motion detection. Kept seeing AI mentioned for face detection, neither camera had that (I had hoped the Eufycam 2 had it). Alerts do try and show a face if it caught one, but not the face identification I read about.Eufycam 2 has better battery and that tamper siren, but other than that not much difference (size shape etc). So I’d suggest buying when there is a good deal and buy two sets while at it for the extra hub.","So I'm updating my previous review from last year from 4 stars to 5. I love Eufy products and have cameras, smart bulbs, vacuums, etc. Was having an issue with these cameras falsely reporting motion when the camera would wake from its sleep mode, that would cause tons of motion alerts 24/7. Worked with their support for a while but didnt seem to have a fix at the time. Now 6 months later their support reached out to me that they pushed new code and to check it now, it does seem they resolved the issue. I recommend Eufy all the time because of their top notch customer support and they have great products at a great price.","My wife bought this as my birthday present. What I really liked this so far is the over box and camera design and user experience. The package seemed really classy from the plastic wrap (tightened) to the unfolding of the corrugated lid.The item I got were HomeBase and the two cameras 2C. The installation was fairly easy and quick. I really liked the use of the app that was downloaded from Google Play Store per the instructions said.The overall camera quality's awesome as I used one for indoor and the other for backyard. The motion detector is great at the sensitivity level (default). I think for a beginner like me, this is a great fit.",8500,1,https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Security-eufyCam-Wireless-180-Day/dp/B07X5W6QB1/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=wireless+security+camera+system&qid=1640229059&sr=8-9

Quick to get started.",Nice NVR that works with Google Assistant and Alexa,"Need a security camera setup? Get this one, you won’t be disappointed!!","I didn't quite know what to expect with this system but I am highly impressed! Prior to this, we just had Blink cameras. We thought those would suffice. Unfortunately, we had some kids in the neighborhood cause some problem. Due to the restrictions of recurring on those the clip was only 15 seconds long and ended up being useless to law enforcement.We ordered this system because it recorded 24/7. After a true plug and play (yes really just plug the cameras in and the system works!) we had all of the cameras installed and the system up in less than an hour. The picture quality on this is outstanding! I have the hard drive hooked up to a tv monitor and I can view all of the cameras at once. I love this as I work from home, yet I know what is going on all around me.There is no limit on recording as it continuously records. I get notifications of human recognition instantly on my phone.Ironically after we installed it there was another issue around the corner from us. Our neighbors knew we had installed cameras and had the police come speak with us. They wanted to know if we had recording of a certain vehicle in the neighborhood at a certain time. We actually did! We sent them the clip and they said this was as good as any system they had seen. That instance was enough to make me thankful we had then system and I think that alone paid for itself!","super easy to set up. just plug everything in, the cameras connect to the NVR automatically, and you're good to go. I added a 500GB hard drive to mine, which was very easy (it comes with screws for a 3.5"" drive, but not for the 2.5"" drive I used. the case has mounting holes for both).after formatting the drive, the NVR automatically set to record. I flipped either from or to time based instead of motion based. it looks like the system allows for expansion up to 8 cameras.These might be wifi cameras, but they're not on your SSID or anything, they use their own (hidden) network (or aren't wifi). The NVR has an ethernet port, but I couldn't get the web interface to work. I didn't try the app.If you want a standalone system that's easy to set up and have recording constantly (or motion triggered), this is good for that.","This review is for the 4 camera wireless NVR without the hard drive. This system was very easy to setup and get running. Just plug the main unit into power and a monitor or TV via the VGA or HDMI port and plug the cameras into their own power adapters. After a few minutes, they connect to the NVR and display their video. Use the included USB mouse (or your own) to answer a few setup questions such as time/date and location. This system can be used without any network/internet connection if you don't want to or can't connect it to the internet. While the cameras are wireless, they don't connect to your WIFI network, only to the base unit. The network connection is through an ethernet jack on the back using the included cable to your home network. You can then scan a QR code to link the TuyaSmart app (I used the Android version). Your camera feeds then show up in the app where you can also link many other smart devices from other brands. The app is where you can enable the mic on the camera to hear audio or click the mic in the app to talk back through the camera.While the on-screen menus may not be ready for your parents/grandparents to use, anyone that has used technology for a while should be able to click around a figure it out.Everything came very well packed and wrapped in their boxes. The camera mounts can swivel around and rotate to just about any angle and even come with mounting screws/wall anchors.My biggest complaint is that the power cables for the cameras (DC barrel jack) are not very long, less than 4ft. There are extension cables available on the internet/amazon to extend the reach.",,"First of all the packaging on the system was done very well. I literally installed the 4 cameras and plugged them in to power them on and there was video instantly. The picture quality is amazing! Better than expected!! The night vision is way better than I had expected it to be. I haven’t played with the app much as of yet, but that is pretty straightforward and simple to use as well. The 2-way audio was easy to use. The motion sensors work extremely well, and with tweaking some settings I’m not getting any false motion notifications! The notifications make knowing when someone is around simple. The customer service is top notch and I can’t see having any issues with them at all. And the best part is the insurance savings on my homeowners policy!!

I ordered the NVR with the built in monitor and four cameras. Everything was packaged very neatly. I am by no means good with electronics typically but this was very easy to set up. I unwrapped everything out of the boxes and was able to set up in a very short amount of time. The instructions were great and the support was great also. I emailed Johnny to receive a manual ahead of time before it shipped so I could get started with reading about it, and he sent one as well as some other detailed instructions that were helpful for my setup. I am very impressed with the entire system. Once I had this set up, I was able to play around with extending the wifi range by setting up one camera as a repeater. That has worked very well with what I need the cameras for. I then set up the app to my phone. I love being alerted when there is motion within one of the cameras! That has been a handy too and kind of fun for monitoring pets while I'm at work :-)","I purchased this system almost 3 weeks ago and am very pleased with it. Currently I have 1 camera located 260 feet from the NVR (signal passing through 2 walls) and it is functioning wonderfully using the standard antenna. I have a second camera 20 feet further from the 1st and this one has spotty reception - due to distance of course - two other cameras showing our front & rear porches/doors. We live in a very rural area, there is nothing (and I do mean nothing) between the cameras and the NVR except the house exterior wall and a room interior wall but I'm still truly surprised that I can get the 260 foot signal - and I'm VERY please with the entire set of equipment. With my old eyes the small screen is a bit of a blur BUT with the 60 inch TV as a monitor it's a fantastic view!!!!!Oh, by the way.... I just placed an Amazon order for another camera and will eventually have all 8 channels filled.","Super easy installation.Physical installation is very intuitive. Look at the parts, and it will be pretty obvious how they go together. Note the cameras were made to be used with cabled or wireless systems, so ignore the cable jack.It WILL work and record WITHOUT Internet access. Until I can run a new cable to the part of the house with the console, it is disconnected from my router. It works fine and records on its hard drive. I just can't use the remote viewing, offsite storage, or phone alerts. They will work when I add it to the network.Directions for operation are adequate. Right-click and start poking around. It will be set to record from the moment you hook it up. But, you'll want to go through the setup process to personalize settings.","This system is easy to install. I installed the camera's where I wanted it, then drilled a hole to run my cords from the camera up into the attic. This was connected to a power connecter that plugged into an outlet. Once that was done, I plugged in the monitor and hard drive and turned it on. Went back and adjusted the camera's and then I was done. To adjust the camera's, there are set screws to loosen and tighten. once I knew where the camera need to be, I had to take off the antenna to tighten the set screws, then re-install the antenna. None of this was hard to do. The night vision is fairly good and daytime was great. It has a lot of memory. There are 2 options on the camera. One is to plug it in and then to a outlet. the other looks like it take a line like a ether line. Not sure since I am not very good with technology. Getting used to the monitor and its system just takes time. There isn't sound as some may thing there is. Also, there is a 1 second delay. I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a security camera system that isn't going to cost you a lot of money. This system was under $300 for 4 cameras, monitor, and hard drive. Pretty good deal in my book.","There are hundreds of camera systems for sale but this one caught my attention when I saw that it creates its own WIFI network so you don't have to connect it to your own. I was worried about range but the system allows you to use a connected camera as a repeater to extend the WIFI network out to reach cameras further away. This was perfect for our application as we have a sizable warehouse and its 150 feet from the front dock to the back parking lot. The original four cameras were already connected to the systems WIFI which was very convenient for install, simply mount and plugin and they were good to go. One downside to this system is that the power adapter that comes with is definitely not something I would plug into an exposed outside outlet however you can get an extension cable for pretty cheap and run the cable inside to an inside outlet.Set-up of the DVR and camera settings can seem a bit overwhelming at first but if you follow the directions which are pretty clear or use the YouTube tutorial its easy. We set our cameras to record constantly during the operating hours and on motion at night so we can keep more days of recordings on hand. For the motion settings, if you are only intending to record if people are present, then set the motion to the lowest setting or you will basically be recording constantly and if you set up text or email alerts you will have a full inbox very quickly.As far as mobile viewing even though the system uses its own WIFI to connect the cameras to the DVR, it does need an outside internet connection to allow for remote or mobile monitoring and alerts. With this model, you can only achieve this by connecting to your router with a direct Ethernet cable connection, you can't link through WIFI. For us this was not an issue since our building is wired for CAT 5 so finding an open port near where we wanted to set this up wasn't to difficult. If you don't have this option then it may limit the location where you can put your DVR but with the repeater abilities built into the camera, this shouldn't be a large issue and your router is most likely in a central location anyways.The mobile app works really well and give an easy way to review motion detection events and even record and back-up video right on your phone. The web based app is a little more clunky and only works with Internet Explorer so definitely not as useful or feature rich.The last thing that I will mention is that this system is expandable to handle 8 cameras and I have already added one to the system and plan to add more. It was quite easy to connect a new camera to the system and once it was mounted and powered, it popped right up.All and all I am pleased with the system and think it is a great tool for both home and business applications. If I didn't already have a home camera and security system I would seriously consider this one as the price is very reasonable and the set-up a snap.",1614,542,https://www.amazon.com/Expandable-Monitor-Wireless-Security-Hiseeu/dp/B07F32X3XZ/ref=sxin_15_trr_7161092011_5?cv_ct_cx=wireless+security+camera+system&keywords=wireless+security+camera+system&pd_rd_i=B07F32X3XZ&pd_rd_r=bebc75bb-9025-4692-b62a-e69f95cb33e8&pd_rd_w=IghQT&pd_rd_wg=ovsoE&pf_rd_p=4d8c4287-5cf4-4061-b040-4022cf74abab&pf_rd_r=A79BAEJAZFGCNBVBHS92&qid=1640229059&sr=1-6-5519553e-2baa-451e-af83-b0156e5c6669

Video quality doesn’t seem to be much better than the cheap wyze cam I replaced with this blink, even after adjusting to “best” quality. Love that it’s wireless and no longer have a 9 foot cable hanging on my wall. App is pretty intuitive. Alexa integration is great. Had an issue with the first cam, customer service was very helpful.","I just want to say for all the people that crap on these cameras, these cameras are amazing. They do the job. They are sturdy. They last through snow, wind, rain, and sun. They have amazing low light vision. Clear pictures. And a great setup to last two years on double AAs. And for those who need them to last longer buy the adapter to plug them in. It's stupid how these people come and review these as if they were 5000 dollar security set ups. These are worth it and a great value.",,"We are happy with our blink indoor cameras. It being wireless, light, and battery powered made it easy to install. The motion detection feature allows you to choose sections of the room you want monitored. The night vision is provides good quality captures and we were surprised the battery life is rated for two years. However, please keep in mind that it could change base on how much you use the live view, how often it triggers to record, how long the duration of recording, is set to, and if your wifi signaling is bad.Note: if you have a large area or areas with lots of obstructions (i.e. cement, brick, steel, and aluminum) walls you may want to have a wifi meshed network to extend you wifi network pass these obstructions. We have the Google Nest Wifi system. Also, the blink camera must connect to the sync module via low frequency radio (LFR). Because of this, the camera must be within distance of the sync module. This is separate from your home wifi network. My suggestion is to get another syn-module if you run into issues where your single sync-module cannot cover all camera areas.","The all-new Blink Indoor – wireless, HD security camera appears to be a good product at a reasonable price. I bought a set of three that came with a Sync module. I believe up to 10 devices can be connected wirelessly to the Sync module that communicates using your home wifi. I was able to easily set up the camera using the Blink app on an iPhone. in addition, I was able to link to Alexa using my Amazon Prime account. This helped to view the camera on the Echo View screen using Alexa voice command such as, ""Alexa, show Living Room.""I understand that Lithium AA batteries (supplied with the camera) would last for two years. Also, there is a USB-C port to power the camera, although no cable or USB charging block is provided.The camera comes with a small mountong bracket and screws for wall or ceiling mounting.15 day trial for storing in the cloud is free and after that the subscription is $3/month per camera or $10/month for all cameras. However, the Sync module has an USB post and a low profile USB thumb drive upto 256 GB may be used to store video clips in MP4 format.My only complaint is that a detailed User's Manual explaining all these should be included instead of finding at Blink support website.",13123,512,https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Indoor-Wireless-Security-Camera-5cam/dp/B07X13N8MY/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=wireless+security+camera+system&qid=1640229059&sr=8-16

Now for the install (see picture). Got this far without cracking the manual and everything works (well at first it didn't, will explain). The hard drive arrives ""Unformatted"" and has to be formated before the NVR will start recording. Also, even after formatting the display was still showing ""not formated"", but after I exited ""System Setup"" and came back the drive was showing as formatted. How to format the drive: right click screen, go to system set up, HDD setup, on the far right is a box that says format, check the box and go to the bottom and click format, exit system setup and then go back in and check the HDD ""status""..What's in the box: four camera's (two pigtails: one power and one RJ45 network connector, antenna and mounts), one NVR (with 2 TB hard drive), one stiff HDMI cable with a nice braided covering (I'm guessing 5 feet long), optical mouse and manual.OK, fully installed and have had one issue: The IP install hit a snag. Snag solved, the manual says you must have WAN connector, this is poorly written, what they are saying: you must have Internet services for IP to work. I have an Actiontec FiOS router and it has two ""IN"" ports, coax cable or the WAN connector, those are input connectors and FiOS uses the coax, the WAN port is not used and cannot be used by other devices. I had a spare LAN port, plugged in the NVR and clicked on diagnostics and bingo, I am now connected ""Healthy Network"". Silly me, I took their description of using a WAN port literally.Update (8/20/2017), asked for and received the CMS software and it arrived right away (awesome support). Got the CMS working, happy I had the manual, the one page setup also sent Grace Hu worked ... but, not at first because I didn't know ... on the preview tab: on that page on the right side-bar you will see: Area & under Area your newly added Cloud ID you have Chanel 1 -4, you need to double-click on the cameras to turn them on for viewing (the camera icon will turn from gray to gold when turned on).","I compared this multi-camera surveillance system with other leading competitors. As a technical person, I reviewed its specifications in detail, and found it to be the best wireless system for protecting small or large homes.After completing its physical installation, I powered up the NVR, then the four cameras.. They paired up within a few minutes and displayed clear pictures on a 4K monitor.The new 13 page user manual (provided later) provides clear instructionsThe 2 TeraByte (TB) storage disk is sufficient for most applications, although larger internal disks can be obtained if extra-ordinary memory is required. For the unit described here, 2 TB was found sufficient to store 14 days of 24/7 operation when the frame rate is set to about 10 frames-per-second (fps), and with a high sensitivity setting. For two weeks of storage, I used about 1.75 TB.Using IP Pro (an Apple app), viewing on my iPhones was flawless, whether watching from the US or from Europe or from the UK.Backing up a time segment to a PC or to a thumb drive was easy.As an advice to fellow users, great care must be exersized in the evaluation of signal losses through building structures (walls, closets, windows,...).Camera output signal power is limited by law, and camera location and orientation are critical for both the NVR and the cameras. Solid brick walls are especially challenging, and some additional amplification may be required for certain installations. Do not allow the cameras to look directly into the sun: it will burn the sensitive optics.Concluding, the technical service and support provided by SMONET is excellent, especially when compared with other products, and the assistance provided by Mrs. Huang has been very helpful.","I bought this system to replace a lower resolution wireless system that I had installed on my house a while back. The DVR for that system became inoperative and the company no longer offers a model that would replace it. So I ordered this SMONET system and I am impressed with it so far. I bought it without the hard drive, as I have a couple of suitable drives handy.I have to say that customer service has been extremely proactive. Crystal from SMONET reached out to me proactively to ensure that I am satisfied with the product and to provide contact information should I ever need it. That is impressive!!!The system is impressive too. Since it is 8 channels where my previous DVR was only 4, I have more options. I was able to connect my existing lower res wireless cameras to this DVR and use those in addition to the 4 new hi-res cameras that came with it. My home has a relatively large footprint being a single story structure of 2700 square feet. All of the cameras manage to connect to the DVR with good signal except for one of the old ones that needed a ""repeater"" even in the old system. The great news - that repeater also works with the new system once everything is properly ""married"".I put a 1 Gig hard drive in mine and it could not have been simpler. Four screws to attach it and then a power cable and SATA cable to connect it. A quick format and it was up and running in minutes. I used a Western Digital drive but you can use a variety of drive sizes and manufacturers.Picture quality is noticeably better which I expected by going to full HD. Even the old low res cameras look pretty good. Motion detection is about the same as the previous system which was very good - so good, in fact, that I have to make sure the cameras are free from spiderwebs as their movement will trigger recording. LOL.The system is easy to set up and configure. Installation does require a power source near the camera but I used some power extension cables, that you can also get on Amazon, where I needed them. Night vision is remarkably good too with the IR illuminators on the cameras.For the price, this was an outstanding value when I ordered it. Now that I've got the hard drive installed so easily AND I was able to ""marry"" my old cameras to this system, it became an even better value.Thanks again, Crystal, for your proactive customer service!!","The selection process in a surveillance system can be challenging and the priorities vary with each user.My highest priority was CUSTOMER SUPPORT, and in an ever changing technological environment, this seller’s customer support, Betty Huang, exceeded all expectations. All issues were promptly responded to, professionally, courteously and with full transparencies!My next priority was COMPATIBILITY with my current hardware technology (High Def 1080P TV, Samsung Android phone, Windows 10 PC, Tablet and laptop) and this Wireless NVR Kit delivered.Next, HIGH DEFINITION video was a must and the camera’s delivered stunning auto focus day and night high definition resolutions.The system was for residential use, so I wanted WIRELESS eliminating unsightly cables like a bowl of spaghetti at the main station/monitoring location, which in my case was my office, and the wireless and surprisingly compact NVR system delivered.Last, which we all consider, was PRICE. The unit is competitively priced compared to current competition for all that it delivers and my second choice was less than $50 lower and it was hard wired and unknown customer support.","Back in December 2016, I purchased my first Smonet NVR that was a 4CH only. That thing has rocked every day since then. For the price and features, you couldn't beat it. I now find my self needing to add more cameras. I purchased this system since I had a 4TB HD already and four existing cameras that I wanted to add to this new system giving me 8 channels. The new system worked out of the box and these are 2MP 1080p cameras vs the 1.3 MP 960p cameras I already had. Now, this system I did not have any problem with as it came. The problem that I ran into was when I wanted to move the Cameras from the old system over to the new one via the match code process. I kept getting the invalid module error (-8) and the camera would not add. Now, working with computers for years now, I noticed that the old cameras had the same IP ranges 172.20.14.30 - .34 which the new system had already assigned to the cameras it came with. No matter if I deleted all cameras and added individually, they all seemed to have the wifi connection info and IP hardcoded inside the camera directly. This is where I was stumped. I wasn't sure how to access the cameras to correct this. I reached out to Smonet via email and they sent the steps needed to access the camera directly as well as the application to configure LAN (not wifi) since its plugged into my switch so I could access the web config page of the camera. Once I did that, I followed the steps on updating the WIFI SSID and passcode to the new NVR info as well as changing the IPs of the old cameras to be 172.20.14.35-38. Once I did this and saved, I did the match code process of the NVR system and BOOOOM! All the old 4 cameras connected easily and were up and running. While the support hours of Smonet are China Time Zone based and not really available for me during the day since I am on EST, they always responded to my emails and were very helpful. The person that assisted was named Crystal. Overall, I am a happy customer and will continue to use their products since typically you can't beat the price. This system for 159 was a good deal as it would have cost me that much just for 4 cameras basically at the going rate of ~35$. So it was a no brainer to go with this setup for the cameras and NVR. The only thing is, I wish I could swap out the antennas on the cameras. My old ones you can, but these seem to have the wire running from inside the camera out to the antenna so you would have to open the camera to replace.. I have external, extended antennas on the NVR since the NVR is located within a Computer RACK system. I will be also be attempting the wifi extending features of the cameras since two of them are for a detached garage that is quite a bit from the base station and I want to improve the signal to them. Overall, I am satisfied and do recommend these systems for an easy and quick DIY job.",1555,747,https://www.amazon.com/SMONET-Wireless-8-Channel-Surveillance-Megapixel/dp/B07DVZS9VB/ref=sxin_15_trr_7161092011_6?cv_ct_cx=wireless+security+camera+system&keywords=wireless+security+camera+system&pd_rd_i=B07DVZS9VB&pd_rd_r=bebc75bb-9025-4692-b62a-e69f95cb33e8&pd_rd_w=IghQT&pd_rd_wg=ovsoE&pf_rd_p=4d8c4287-5cf4-4061-b040-4022cf74abab&pf_rd_r=A79BAEJAZFGCNBVBHS92&qid=1640229059&sr=1-7-5519553e-2baa-451e-af83-b0156e5c6669

After I provided them pictures of the camera's showing them fogged up and a close up of one of them showing the water in the camera that they requested I send them, they quickly sent me out new camera's to replace the fogged up ones at no charge to me. What started out as a bad experience, they quickly made it right at not cost to me.Because of there great fast service, I increased my rating to 5 stars and recommend this system. It works great, and if you have any issue with it, let them know and they will fix it/make it right fast.","I have only had this system running a few days but I am very impressed. Picture clarity, day or night, is excellent. As others have stated the manual is lacking, but I was able to figure out things enough to get it up and running. Playing with the various settings windows allowed me to dial each channel in to my liking, particularly motion sensing. Truthfully the worse that could happen if you mess up is you would need to reset to factory default and start over. I will most likely add 2 more cameras.I gave tech support 3 stars only because I have yet to require their services, but I am assuming they will be helpful if needed. The build quality appears top notch and the overall product is very attractive. I have not yet downloaded the app to view remotely, but that should work OK.I am very glad I decided to purchase this system. Hopefully it will serve us for years.December 14, 2019 Update: This has been an absolutely great system. It was very easy to add the other 2 cameras and set them up. I downloaded the app to my phone and am able to view remotely from anywhere. I was 1200 miles from home and logged into the app and it worked perfectly. Very nice to check on things while away. I showed this to a neighbor and he was blown away with the picture quality and viewing angles. He intends to purchase one himself. I have yet to need to contact Tech Support.","I have been thinking of buying a surveillance system for 2 years. Finally, I got this one a few days ago. It features easy installation (power on the wifi cameras, wait a little while, then they will be automatically shown on the screen), great picture quality as well as the 2TB pre-installed hard drive, which provide enough space for recording videos for about 30 days. What makes me particularly satisfied is I also got a very good display. Additionally, the system also can be connected directly to my iPhone with the App (IP Pro3). I got what I want and more……. Really like it and will buy another one if needed !!All in all, this is a great product with satisfactory quality, especially the reasonable price...... just perfect!! highly recommend !!","I purchased the 6 camera system with a monitor and got it up and running within about 45 minutes. Pictures on monitor are very clear and playback can be obtained easily. The phone app is convenient to check what's going on from anywhere. The only negative is that there's no audio, even though on the phone app is a microphone button. Any support I've needed I've gotten thru Facebook - you become ""friends"" with Verna Jane, and send her messages, which she normally replies within a day or so. A few months after having the system up, I purchased 2 more cameras since the monitor was capable of handling up to 8. About a year later now, I've purchased my second 6 camera/monitor system. My phone app works to see both systems now (14 cameras total). The cameras are considered wireless but does need to be plugged in to an electrical outlet. They come with an NVR recording unit, Monitor, a mouse, a usb flash drive, & network cable. Considering all that's included, the price is very reasonable.",For the money this is a great product. When you receive it you can easily set up several camera's easily but remember you will need to make some configuration changes depending on your situation. Spend some time with the software and go though the online documentation otherwise you may feel lost. The distance the wireless supports is good. I'm pushing the wireless limits with a distance of just over 200 ft and am impressed.Support was responsive within a few hours of sending them an email and offered to assist if I needed it.,311,91,https://www.amazon.com/11-6-inch-Portable-Surveillance-Wireless-Security/dp/B07PYGC4BR/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=wireless+security+camera+system&qid=1640229059&sr=8-13

Still Works!,"Update On Dec 15, 2020",Great system,Nice system,"Hiseeu 8 Channel Expandable w/12"" Monitor Wireless Security Camera System","We purchased this to give us security while living in a rural area. This has it's own wifi system that communicates from the monitor to the cameras. So if you have no wifi, it will still work. If you want to view from your phone, then you would need to plug the monitor into the router. It was very easy to set up. We just plugged in the cameras to power, and it communicated with the monitor. The cameras came up on the monitor. We bought a 4 camera system, but will probably add 4 more cameras. It was an excellent choice!","This is my first home video security system. I researched many systems before purchasing it. The features that I insisted upon were good video definition, night vision, significant storage capacity, and wireless connectivity between the cameras and the NVR (network video recorder). A good friend of mine showed me his system which was wireless but the cameras ran on batteries which he had to replace frequently. I knew I did not want a system that ran on batteries; this one requires a physical connection to house wiring for power. It comes with plug-in transformers for each camera and one for the NVR. There is also an antenna with a 10 foot cable for one camera if it is installed in an area that cannot penetrate through too many walls. This antenna allows you to place it in an area that is less obstructed. It works great! I bought the system with the 12 inch monitor which I think is the best combination. It eliminates the need to incorporate a laptop or television to view images from the cameras. (My system came with 4 cameras.) The monitor is a self-contained unit which includes a 3 Terrabyte hard drive and the electronics which run the system. It provides storage for 30 days of high definition video from all 4 cameras. It comes with a two-button mouse which works with the monitor and system just like a desktop or laptop computer system. I purchased 2 Vanxsecctv 10m(30 ft) 2.1x5.5mm CC 12volt Power Extension Cables for CCTV Security Cameras. These let me run power to 2 of my cameras that were not near power supplies. Also, I took advantage of the 8% Hiseeu discount offer just by sending an email to Johnny@hiseeu.com and requesting it. They replied within a few hours with the discount code which I successfully used. I am amazed at the night-vision capability of this system. The specifications say it has a 65 foot limitation but that is not the case. I have one camera aimed straight down our driveway which is about 120 feet long and it ""sees"" that far in total darkness. The detail is surprising! I bought the 3-year extended warranty (just in case). I can highly recommend this system.Update on June 5, 2020 If I could rate this system with more than 5 stars, I would. I am continuously impressed with the quality of this system. My wife, who is not technically gifted, loves to use the system to keep watch on our outdoor cats. We have observed several night critters meandering around our property that we would not have had any notion of their presence without this system. The company has contacted me by email to ask me how the system is working. If you are unsure of which home security system to buy I don't think you could go wrong with this one!Update on Dec 15, 2020One disappointing aspect of this system that I just found out is that it will only record 4 channels at a time. I added a 5th camera to the system and could view it just fine. I could not figure out how to record the new camera so I contacted the company. They responded within hours and told me it only records 4 channels. You can choose which 4 channels but if you have more than 4 they will not record. I am OK with that but the information in the system description is misleading. I'm sorry if my endorsement of this system has caused anyone else to be mislead too.","After a bit of a learning curve, this security system is a wonderful system. Great picture quality and with the 3TB hard drive, it records continuously for nearly 30 days. We've only had it for a little over a month and have recorded one suspicious person walking around our home while we were at work. We also purchased an audio camera that we have inside our home to keep an eye on our pets while we're away. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FVSK6BY?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_asin_imageInstalling the cameras may require some work, depending on where you want them located around your home. I installed one by the garage, drilled a hole through the exterior wall and made sure that an outlet was nearby on the inside. The cameras have a great picture and the night vision is very clear as well. I have not had an issue with bad reception either. Our cameras are all within 30-40 feet of the wifi base unit.",one month ago I bought the 8 channel system than came with 4 cameras and a 3 TB monitor DVR. I added 2 additional Hiseeu cameras. Everything has been working well. The pictures are clear for a long distance in daylight and a good distance even at night.

After 6 weeks of use the Battery bar still shows full !!!,"Best buy, value for money, it has everything",Perfect wireless camera,Tough little gem of a camera.,It's pretty good.,"This camera is absolutely wonderful! From when I first opened the box I was very impressed with the packaging and the high quality of materials used to make this product. I could see that much thought and consideration was put into the design. The software installation was a breeze! Once I downloaded the app and turned on the camera, the app immediately recognized the camera and just a few simple steps later my camera was ready to work. I was also very happy to see that I had a few options for mounting the camera and what really made my day was that I was able to mount the camera without having to drill any permanent holes in the walls. (there is also the option to mount it via a screw and hanging it). Once the mount is secure on the wall, attaching the camera to it with the built-in magnet is easy and ball design allows you to adjust the camera angle or remove the camera at any given time.Immediately after I completed the setup and installation, I get real-time notifications when there is any motion detection. As long as I have a stable connection on my phone, I have the option to use the intercom function to speak to whoever is at my door. What I really like about the notification function is that I can go back and view screenshots as well as video. The quality of the picture and video is very good and the night vision function works incredibly well. I attached a picture to this review of my two dogs in a completely blacked out room.The waterproof design is also nice to have although it was not a necessity for me now, it may come in handy some day.I have used the camera indoors at times to check in on my dogs and now mostly use it for the front and rear entry to my house.Now what really surprised me most with this camera is the battery life. I was very skeptic to the claims made in the listing but now after nearly 6 weeks of daily usage and the battery indicator shows full bars! Well, color me impressed!!!Overall it is great for me to be able to see who is at my door, whether I am home or not.One thing I would like to add and I hope the seller can see this comment is that the font on the instruction manual is very very small. I recommend enlarging the font so that it can be easily read by old timers like me.","I recently planned to go out of country for few days and wanted to have a camera to keep an eye on my house while I am away. Once the product was received, my daughter could do the set up in just few minutes using my phone. I installed this in the front porch using the included stickers. Magnetic attachment is super easy to bring in for charging. I didn't want any wiring and any hard installation in the wall. So the set up was really easy. Location of the device is about 40ft from the router. I charged it to 100% though it came pre charged. Picture quality is super clear. Night vision is perfect. Monitored the view from different country for days and the camera still was 100% charged. Very happy with the purchase. Motion activation is perfect, sends a message to my phone. I haven't used the SD card option yet.",,"I know the saying you get what you paid for, and I found this camera to be a great value. The price and reviews were what sold me. My experience is as follows.......First fast delivery with prime. Received and installed 5/7/2019 ...Then my device was fully charged and undamaged when received. Simple directions. Great pics and night vision, easy installation. Motion detection works well as well as the person to person intercom. The camera is also (in my opinion) of good quality, heavy duty. I would say that especially after I dropped twice with clumsy hands (not on purpose) in stalling memory card. Maybe 4’.5” above floor. As far as the app, it works fine , I do wish that you could send videos or pics to email since it is connected to my internet with out taking memory card out... but this is not a deal breaker. I will be going on trip and will test long distance receiving of notifications. One of the neighbors’ kids set it off and I was notified pretty quick. I show that the camera is running at 52% internet signal because of installation distance from router, and still get impressive results. I read somewhere that the battery will or could last to upwards to 120 days in standby operation, .... after trip I plan on making another purchase... I may or may not get a router signal booster, but I am very happy with my decision and experience with this camera. I will post and update on battery performance later when I have to charge again but we all know that the amount of time on live feeds and motion detection will need to be taken into an account... P.S. I will post pics soon.","Surprisingly, this is a pretty good quality camera. I like that it alerts you when theres any movement detected. It recorded and take pictures when theres movement. With that being said you can put an SD card in to save your pictures and videos but theres also a cloud where you can choose to pay monthly or yearly. So you have options to either choose SD or a Cloud monthly/yearly subscription.UPDATE on battery life: I received this item on june 6th but I didnt put it up until june 10th and right now is july 6th. So the battery is at 18% as of right now. So if you use the camera as often as I did(every time theres a notifications due to high sensitivity movements) of course it'll take up the battery. It did however notify me that its 18% and it needs to be charged or it will automatically shut off. Still not bad. Planning on buying another to rotate while the other one is charging. Picture quality is pretty good.On another note, there's a solar for this camera that can be charged without having to take it down to plug in to charge. Less worries about the battery being low and it'll continously charge throughout the day.",13997,2,https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Rechargeable-Detection-Waterproof-compatible/dp/B07PM2NBGT/ref=sxin_15?asc_contentid=amzn1.osa.da221888-46b7-4406-bb34-985a0a59c082.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&asc_contenttype=article&ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.da221888-46b7-4406-bb34-985a0a59c082.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B07PM2NBGT&cv_ct_cx=wireless+security+cameras&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.da221888-46b7-4406-bb34-985a0a59c082.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_we=asin&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source-earns-comm&keywords=wireless+security+cameras&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B07PM2NBGT&pd_rd_r=04c789c9-0d23-499f-a9c3-a07c4dccfb1c&pd_rd_w=PzlAa&pd_rd_wg=aqiD9&pf_rd_p=b029c82c-aced-48fe-b955-08794dc4e3cd&pf_rd_r=8GDJMRM2W7T8KVJCWKP9&qid=1640229254&sr=1-3-a3cc9a7a-2f07-46dc-8259-ac02200376a0&tag=ignarticleonsite-20

This Pro3 replaced a Pro2 to cover more area with the wider angle lens and it is definitely a keeper. Not sure about the other reviewer stating you have to have the Smart Premier package to keep your videos because I already had it and the camera integrated perfectly with my already established Arlo ecosystem. There is a slight improvement in video quality over cellular data but a major improvement on you local WiFi with the 2K live preview option over the Pro2. The colors do not seem as saturated with the Pro3 but that is not a deal breaker. All in all if you are coming from the Arlo Pro expect some nice upgrades, coming from the Pro2 you will still see improvement just will not be as impressive.","This is my first security camera setup. I really just wanted a camera for basic alerts and to make the potential thief think twice before stopping at my home. Similar to a yard sign indicating an alarm system, sometimes just the appearance of extra security is enough to make most bad guys move on. Installation, mounting, and charging up the camera was painless and I had everything up and running in no time. It took about 30 minutes to create an account and set up the camera and base station. Charging the camera to full capacity took about 2 to 3 hours. My goal was to set up a security camera for the Thanksgiving holiday since I was planning on going out of town for the week and Arlo did not disappoint. I promptly received alerts from someone leaving flyers on the front door and I even got a few notices of a cat that apparently likes to roam in front of the house late at night. The cat looked surprised by the motion light when it came on as it walked by. Most impressive of all, the camera battery only went down by 3% during the entire week so I can tell that it will easily last for most of the month or longer before I need to recharge it. The only negative that I did notice was a slight delay between the camera recording and the event taking place. It seemed like it may have been a 1 to 3 second delay. This could be a concern to other potential buyers because a lot can happen in a few seconds when you are talking about criminal mischief. I wasn't as concerned about it because as I mentioned earlier I mainly wanted basic event alerts and the appearance of security. That's enough to scare off 99% of most thieves. For that remaining 1% of criminals no security camera or alarm system will deter them so for me the arlo pro 3 met my needs. I am definitely considering a second camera to monitor the back yard or inside of my house in the near future.","Easy to use, app is easily navigated, cameras have good quality pictures. System gives peace of mind.",Bought these for peace of mind after my divorce. The picture quality is amazing during the day and at night. The spotlight is bright too.

I’ve had them for 2 weeks and I’m already at 50% battery.,"The cameras were super easy to install.

It has been totally re-engineered. Take it from someone who owns all the different cameras Blink had to offer since day one and had to get on a waiting list to get the very first one. So, I should know what iam talking about. This new camera no longer has the push down and pull system to open the back to install batteries. It has a large screw that you simply unscrew with a included tool to open the back of the camera which is really nice. Once you open the back and install the included batteries scan the small QR code inside the camera threw the blink app it will scan to find the camera once that is done it will automatically do a firmware update. After that you are ready to install your new blink camera. Also noticed the sound is much louder and more clear then the other cameras. This is good if two people are talking in a low voice you can hear what they are saying. Has brighter clearer night vision. Nice clear voice communication with two way talk. Alot stronger wifi signal to sink module and from sink module to camera. Sharp, clear, bright, and colorful HD vision during the day. I noticed before I wrote this review that some people only gave this camera 2 or 3 stars. Like the guy who is complaining about software issues. Well if you follow the directions you would not have that problem. Let the camera finish its firmware update. Duh ! Also, if you have been a Blink customer for a while and want to add this camera to your current system. You do not have to pay for cloud storage you are grandfathered in. After you add this camera to your existing system it will actually tell you this ! The front of the camera has a all new face with a very smooth and shinny surface iam sure to help combat the weather and give it a more high tec look. Their is no longer a switch inside the camera to turn on or off the blue recording light located on the front of the camera. It's is all done threw the app which is really nice as well. They really did a good job in re-engineering this camera and listened to customer complaints about their past cameras and went threw and fixed every issue. I would definitely buy this camera again ! UPDATE : 09-25-20 After using this camera for a couple of days. And as other reviewers have noted that this camera only has a 25 foot motion trigger ! Anything further than 25 feet it will NOT record when motion is present. So if you need a camera get the Blink XT2 for the further range. This camera will only be good for specific areas like door or window that are within the 20 to 25 foot range from the camera.","It's super easy. Works great. Setup was simple. It works exactly as advertised. What I didn't know for sure is that the batteries are just high quality AA batteries. So when they die, you can get some rechargeable ones and just rotate them through the thing. I'm going to order a couple more. They are pretty great. *Edit-A nice person took the time to let me know it's best not to replace w/ traditional AA batteries.","So far everything is as advertised. Setup was a breeze and the image quality is great - especially when set to “best.” I really appreciate the custom activity zones that you can set, as well as the ability the turn off the led light.In terms of improvement, the included mount is pretty basic. For better or worse the mount snaps into the back of the camera module. This makes installing it relatively easy, but also means anyone could detach it with a firm pull. I’ve noticed that there are upgraded mounts that you buy, but haven’t had a chance to fully check those out yet.Lastly, I noticed another reviewer mentioned subscription pricing, but it’s a bit misleading. Yes, there is cloud storage that you can pay for, but there are multiple levels, including a free plan, as well as a basic plan for $3/month. Also, the paid plans don’t start until 2021. More importantly, What this camera has, that the XT2 doesn’t, is local storage. If you’re big on privacy, and don't want to store videos on the cloud, you can attach a USB drive to the blink module and save your videos there (see photo which shows the usb drive). There’s no fee for saving your videos locally - you can still get alerts and watch your video feed live for free.",What an awesome product...total install took 25 minutes. I put 3 camera’s up outside to monitor my summer home. One of the camera’s I places on a pole in the yard pointing at the roof so I can monitor snow fall and snow melt roof system. The app was friendly. I shared the app with my wife and she was up and running in 2 minutes with minimal effort. We are so happy with this wireless system.,88175,4,https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Outdoor-Wireless-Security-Camera-5cam/dp/B086DKGCFP/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=wireless+security+cameras&qid=1640229254&sr=8-1

They last through snow, wind, rain, and sun. They have amazing low light vision. Clear pictures. And a great setup to last two years on double AAs. And for those who need them to last longer buy the adapter to plug them in. It's stupid how these people come and review these as if they were 5000 dollar security set ups. These are worth it and a great value.",,"We are happy with our blink indoor cameras. It being wireless, light, and battery powered made it easy to install. The motion detection feature allows you to choose sections of the room you want monitored. The night vision is provides good quality captures and we were surprised the battery life is rated for two years. However, please keep in mind that it could change base on how much you use the live view, how often it triggers to record, how long the duration of recording, is set to, and if your wifi signaling is bad.Note: if you have a large area or areas with lots of obstructions (i.e. cement, brick, steel, and aluminum) walls you may want to have a wifi meshed network to extend you wifi network pass these obstructions. We have the Google Nest Wifi system. Also, the blink camera must connect to the sync module via low frequency radio (LFR). Because of this, the camera must be within distance of the sync module. This is separate from your home wifi network. My suggestion is to get another syn-module if you run into issues where your single sync-module cannot cover all camera areas.","The all-new Blink Indoor – wireless, HD security camera appears to be a good product at a reasonable price. I bought a set of three that came with a Sync module. I believe up to 10 devices can be connected wirelessly to the Sync module that communicates using your home wifi. I was able to easily set up the camera using the Blink app on an iPhone. in addition, I was able to link to Alexa using my Amazon Prime account. This helped to view the camera on the Echo View screen using Alexa voice command such as, ""Alexa, show Living Room.""I understand that Lithium AA batteries (supplied with the camera) would last for two years.

However, the Sync module has an USB post and a low profile USB thumb drive upto 256 GB may be used to store video clips in MP4 format.My only complaint is that a detailed User's Manual explaining all these should be included instead of finding at Blink support website.",13123,512,https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Indoor-Wireless-Security-Camera-5cam/dp/B07X13N8MY/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=wireless+security+cameras&qid=1640229254&sr=8-6

The spotlight function turns on anytime someone comes close to my driveway and makes the night time recording clear and with color. I love the people and package detection feature, it cuts out a lot of false alerts. Overall super pleased with it and hope that it deters people from trying to open car doors in my drive way.","I bought this camera as an add-on for my Arlo Pro 2 4-camera system. The cameras for the Pro 2 are difficult to find new and just as expensive as this camera, so I tried this Arlo Essential Spotlight camera. They advertise a longer battery life, a higher-quality night-time color picture, and the spotlight. So far I am very happy with those claims. I'm now at the maximum number (5) of cameras that a free subscription will allow. It added itself to my base unit with no issues at all. The Pro 2 cameras and the Essential Spotlight camera will also work with some other systems, including Samsung Smart Things. I use the Samsung Smart Wi-Fi plug switch to control a light, and I can use its phone app to run my Arlo. An issue: the Samsung App likes to arm and disarm my system at random times. I'm working at figuring out the reason and maybe a fix; meanwhile back to the Arlo phone app for my cameras. The Samsung app also seems to be controlling my phone wi-fi and turning it on and off randomly. Another minor annoyance: the spotlight isn't all that bright nor does it stay on but about 10-15 seconds. There might be controls for that in a paid subscription but none on a free setup. By the way, you get a 30-day subscription trial with the purchase (covering ONLY this new camera). No bright/time controls in it. At night it's bright enough to startle a lurker but that's about it. I WISH IT STILL USED THE MAGNETIC MOUNT SYSTEM THE ARLO PRO 2 USES. I'm still satisfied; if I choose to go with the paid subscription and add a sixth camera, I will buy another Arlo Essential Spotlight camera.","I bought two cameras, one for a high traffic area and one for a lower traffic area. After two months, the front door high traffic camera is at 50% battery life which is better than I expected- this camera can trigger up to 20 times per day for me. The back door triggers about 4 events per day and is still at 90%! There is a slight delay in video- you miss the first few seconds of the ‘event’ once the camera turns on. But the picture is clear, night vision with or without spotlight is great, the app is easy to use, set up was quick and easy, and I have not experienced the disconnecting problems others refer to. I liked them so much I recently bought another to add. I would recommend",,"I'm having so much fun with this camera. I'm 73 yrs old and I downloaded manual. Easy to understand. I practiced by setting it outdoors at night to see what I would find. Next morning I had pictures of a mouse, bunny, and coyote. Excellent photos. During daytime I recorded a friend in the yard. My friend was impressed when I shared the video on cell phone. Again excellent quality. I'm so excited for quality at this price. Haven't tried all options yet, but I have no doubt they'll operate as good as the ones I've already tried. I'm ordering another one for other side of house. They can be hand-held, screwed to wall, lay on ground (I did all) and videos are great.

Before I installed this system I tested it at my hose to make sure it worked properly and it passed with flying colors. My home is about 3800 sq. feet and of course the cameras on the first level worked fine as being the closest, and to test it further I placed two other cameras as far as I could on the lower level and closed all the doors.

I have had CCTV cameras in my house for years. I've been using Swann wired cameras for the most part with mixed emotions. But running new wires to upgrade the system just didn't excite me.I had been looking at NEST cams since I have the smart Thermostats and Smoke/Carbon-monoxide detectors for a while, but the price is ridiculous! Plus your only option with them is cloud service (an additional cost). Then I spoke with a neighbor who sent me a screen shot from his YI camera. I must say, the quality was pretty impressive.So I bought a four pack for $119.00 with moderate expectations. Let me tell you I'm super impressed with the picture quality of these cameras. Set up is quick and easy. When I purchased them I had no idea they had audio as well. The audio quality is incredible, plus it's a two way speaker. Purchased 32 GB SD cards for all of them so I didn't need to use cloud storage and it's been working great! I have them set to record all motion and I usually have about 7 days of history on each camera.Day and night vision are both spectacular IMO. I have attached several photos so you can see the quality both day and night. Side note, I have a couple ""indoor cams"" mounted outside. To do this I purchased a rubber sleeve/cover from Amazon to make the drop cam weather resistant for outdoor application. It's been through rain, sleet and snow with out issue so far. Link to cover: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FD5XHMP/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1A couple cons, the power cable is sooooooo short. I had to purchased longer cables for a couple of my installs. No biggie, they are only a few dollars here on Amazon. The app for iOS is very functional, but it has no multi camera view which would be a nice option.","So I have been using the Yi 1080p indoor camera system for 2 weeks now and I LOVE IT! The camera's are crystal clear during the day and are just as sharp in night mode. The added features of being able to hide any ""lights"" such as the blue power light and the typical red IR lights for night vision makes ""hiding"" these cameras a breeze. The playback function works great and give you the time in hours, minutes & seconds. The 2 way talk feature works great and has 2 modes, 1 is a push to talk feature where when you press the button you cannot hear what the person on the camera is saying and the 2nd is a continuous talk where you and the person on the camera can talk back and forth without pressing any buttons (love this feature) the 32gig on board storage is also a great bonus. Like I said I have been using the cameras for about 2 weeks and have barely used 3 gigs of space. (for an idea of the amount of traffic, it's just me, my wife and our 2 pets) so the cameras don't get a ton of action during the week. But are always recording on any motion. (I do not subscribe to the cloud storage as for I haven't seen a need) Anytime you get an alert it will store it on the app and you can upload it to your mobile device and share it with others. The initial motion detection clip is only 6 seconds, but if you wait till the end of the 6 seconds you will get an option to ""view entire motion"" which will bring up that camera, rewind to when it first detected the motion and play it back until there is no longer any motion, GREAT feature. All of the features seem to work as expected, you can set times for your camera to alert you when it detects motion and zones so that your dog walking around doesn't keep triggering the alerts. I can say the motion detection is VERY sensitive. You can set the setting to low, medium or high but really I can't tell a difference low to high. I have one camera facing out of my front window and it picks up shadows, car lights, leaves blowing, etc. Not a big deal, but on a windy day I can get a ton of alerts. The app works great, you can set a PIN or use your fingerprint to log into the cameras so in the event your phone is stolen, unless they have your PIN or fingerprint they will not be able to pull up your cameras. Connecting them was very simple and took less than 5 minutes per camera. Plug them in, scan the UR code and they will automatically connect to the network your phone is connected to. The packaging was very nice, didn't feel cheap. All cameras were individually wrapped along with all of the accessories. Comes with instruction booklet for assistance with installing/setup. The camera (black part) can be removed from the white base and mounted in different areas. They also sell (separately) wall mounts for the cameras. (cheap, like $10-$15 for a 4 pack) or you can stand them up anywhere you like (they have a round rubber grip on the bottom to help keep them from sliding around. All 4 cameras come with a USB cord and power brick. The USB cord is about 10-12 feet long so you should be able to place these cameras wherever you'd like. OK so I hope this rant...I mean review was helpful. If you're anything like me, I read all the reviews on a product before I make a purchase. Thanks for reading!***(I am not affiliated with Yi or any of there products, this was simple a consumer review, please purchase these at your own risk)***","I purchased the Yi 4 pk. 1080 Indoor security cameras. I was skeptical but am so glad I took the chance. I placed them in various windows facing outside as it’s outside I want to observe. They work perfectly during the day and, where the outside area is lit, at night. If the area is not lit, there is a reflection on the glass from the IR light, but they ARE designed to be indoor cameras. They work very well indoors, day and night, as intended. I have observed some sketchy people that have rung my doorbell when I’m not home (I have a camera in the window next to door), along with the neighbor’s cat, a family of raccoons, an opossum and numerous squirrels. I had an issue where they stopped alerting me of activity (which I see some others have had, also) and contacted Yi customer service. They promptly replied to my request and worked with me to make sure all my phone settings were correct. Turned out, the problem was with my phone settings, battery saver shutting down the app, NOT with the cameras or their app. I especially love that I can insert my own sd cards to save & view past events and not have to pay for ‘cloud’ subscription. I don’t know of another security camera that offers this. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase! In fact, I ordered another set of 4. If you are still in doubt, look up some reviews and comparisons of the Yi cameras on youtube.",,"Best Security Option for a home because:1. Its a one time charge- no monthly subscription- and all of the features of the camera work with the SD card2. The camera video is excellent especially the Night vision- it can see in almost complete darkness- wow3. The detection system is superb- I especially like that you can select an area within the total viewing area for detection. I use this feature so the cars that pass outside of my house do not trigger the alert only the area literally right in front of my door.4. The intercom is clear and at the appropriate volume5. Install and app use is seriously easy whether your a ""techy"" or not6. Small form and can be hidden without drawing attention7. Excellent price - for what you get its so worth it!8. Retrieve data on multiple device- My wife and I can both check our home and get the alerts simultaneously.9. Still records video on SD card even when wifi is out10. The option to make the camera stealth (no sound or constant blue light)As long as the camera and app lasts then I would definitely tell you do hesitate, buy it- its worth it and more.",25027,2,https://www.amazon.com/YI-Wireless-Security-Surveillance-Monitor/dp/B01CW4CEMS/ref=sxin_15?asc_contentid=amzn1.osa.da221888-46b7-4406-bb34-985a0a59c082.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&asc_contenttype=article&ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.da221888-46b7-4406-bb34-985a0a59c082.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B01CW4CEMS&cv_ct_cx=wireless+security+cameras&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.da221888-46b7-4406-bb34-985a0a59c082.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_we=asin&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source-earns-comm&keywords=wireless+security+cameras&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B01CW4CEMS&pd_rd_r=04c789c9-0d23-499f-a9c3-a07c4dccfb1c&pd_rd_w=PzlAa&pd_rd_wg=aqiD9&pf_rd_p=b029c82c-aced-48fe-b955-08794dc4e3cd&pf_rd_r=8GDJMRM2W7T8KVJCWKP9&qid=1640229254&sr=1-2-a3cc9a7a-2f07-46dc-8259-ac02200376a0&tag=ignarticleonsite-20

My test was around 70 feet deep. Day video quality is great, phone app working fine but slowing down a bit, too much data going thru. Overall I love it. Wireless connection is great around my house. Customer support and service was great, they working from 5pm-12am pacific time, they helped me a lot and I want to say thank you.","For my purposes, the system worked great. I install them into my workshop and placed the NVR in the house. I did use the one provided antenna extension and that worked well on one of the cameras. The furthest camera away was about 90 feet. It brought my signal from two bars to three which was plenty to receive the video. The rest work with the existing antennas just fine. The 1TB drive is plenty for my use as well since I will have the system reformat itself every 10 days. With 4 Cameras recording full time...I was concerned to it might fill up to quick...however so far, no real concern as it appears the 1TB drive works fine for my needs with plenty of room left after my testing. The NVR was truly plug and play and I experience no issues with any of the cameras coming on line when I plugs them in to the NVR. Great price and ease of use was what I wanted. Good job!",,"I ordered this security camera system plus an extra camera with two way audio in reaction to a rash of burglaries (one next door!) in our neighborhood. They arrived together and were delivered a day earlier than expected with a follow-up email from Saul at Aomeisi Security making sure we'd set it up successfully. We hadn't yet, but I appreciate the conscientious effort from the seller.This is truly a plug and play system as far as getting the video feeds set up and running wirelessly (the cameras do need to be plugged in to an electrical outlet). The system, when hooked up to a tv or a monitor with speakers, allows you to see video from all of the cameras, but hear audio from only one camera at a time.The extra camera can be added to the system via the supplied cat 5 patch cable very easily and then it will function like the other cameras with the added benefit of two way audio (once again, only one camera at a time.)The video quality is awesome and the motion detection is very sensitive!Since the cameras each need to be plugged into a power source, the actual placement of the cameras is, of course, more involved. Extra 12v 5.5x2.1mm cable is probably necessary for placement far away from an electrical outlet. But, after a bit of trial and error and extra cable, the overlap in the cameras' lines of sight make it difficult if not impossible to sneak by.The NVR system can receive wireless signals from the cameras without plugging in to the router, but it cannot connect to the router wirelessly. You must plug in to the router to view the video feed on your phone (download the free mobile app IP Pro from Google Play and you can also get notifications on your phone) or on a pc or laptop remotely.The manual is a little challenging to read and comprehend, but I think the more you work with it, the better sense it makes .","Really simple to set up, picture is crystal clear.

Build quality and image quality are excellent.,I swapped a Pro2 for a new Ultra2. It was easy to setup the new camera in the Arlo app. The camera position tool in the app made it easy to position the cameras view. The video quality is very good with some slight chromatic aberrations at high zoom levels at 20+ feet. The detection algorithm is also very good. It recorded a squirrel and correctly flagged it as an animal. Distance to the hub is probably 30-40 feet with one exterior wall in between.,"Unlike my experience with Arlo's wired doorbell and chime, the Ultra 2 cameras work fabulously. The batteries do not last the advertised length of time. Knowing that I ordered two extras and the charger. The main camera battery had to be exchanged every two days and the secondary camera in our carport every five days. I installed a third-party 3 watt solar panel designed for the Arlo for each camera. The solar panels keep both batteries charged at 100 percent. I think it will be a pain to review the recordings on the base station's mini SD card, so there is no question in my mind that customers purchasing the cameras will also need to purchase Arlo's cloud storage service once the free trial period is over. Customers need to have reasonable expectations. I have my camera's set at the best quality settings, but still, don't expect to be able to read license plate numbers, and the ""color"" in nighttime recordings is very marginal.","I purchased the Ultra 2 to replace an aged system. Once you see the video, you'll declare 4k video is the only way to go. I installed the two cameras outdoors myself, and I am far from being a home improvement guy. You'll love it. I also watch my camera feed at night on my Amazon Echo Show. Be mindful there is an update package for the cameras and the base. Do the quick download before installing.

I originally purchased the Blink camera system because I was thrilled with having month long battery life and the tiny profile cameras I could mount in the corner of my room.They served me well for a time, but like many people I began having major privacy concerns when Amazon purchased them. Eufy's camera systems are different. No footage is uploaded to the cloud and instead all of your video lives locally on your device. Eufy claims it is encrypted, but I wish they would specify if their employees have any way to ever access the footage or not. Some clarification on the privacy end of things would help further set them apart from Blink and their other competitions.I decided to take a chance on the Eufy 2C after having an amazing experience with Eufy's video doorbell.I'm so glad I did! The cameras are low profile and blend in easily in corners or even just mounted to walls. The base station is quite small and looks right at home next to my router, and the app works instantly with no headache. The cameras have crisp video and audio and Eufy provides easy-to-follow instructions for mounting. I do wish the mounts were magnetic or had a way to quickly remove the cameras for charging. Thankfully, after several days I haven't gone down a single tick in battery life so I am hopeful charging will be few and far between. Notably missing is Homekit support and expandable storage, but Eufy promises us that both of these features are coming soon. They seem to have a good track-record for customer service so I am hopeful.Below I will provide some pros/cons but to be honest none of the cons are dealbreakers, just things I hope Eufy will consider for their next software updates and product iterations.This is the best security camera system I have ever used and one of the simplest setups as well. I can't recommend this product enough! Go buy it!Pros:-GREAT video quality-Spotlight functionality-Seamless App and great wireless range-Good installation instructions-Battery life/USB charging-RTSP (record to your network or NAS!)-Clear audio & 2/way audio-Good nightvision performance-Recording light-Built-in sirens on each camera and homebase-AI detection means my pets don't set off the cameras (THANK-YOU!)Cons:-No HomeKit Support-No Geofencing (Auto arm on leaving and disarm on arrival)-16GB/ No way to expand storage with USB or SD (yet)-Mounts are cumbersome, magnetic would be a lot easier to remove for charging-No way to re-arrange order of cameras in the app","Overall I got this over the Arlo system. Price of the immediate purchase and since no monthly fee it was a no brainer. I did. I two sets 2c and Eufycam 2. I needed two hubs to reach my backyard and front corner of my house. About the furthest two points from each other. Hub range could be better as it has trouble going through walls.Clarity is goodDetection is about 90%. I think it may require time to ‘settle’. For example I setup and kept walking in front of it and it did t go off for a day. Was about to return when it started working. So do give it a chance. Start with all motion and high sensitivity, and go down from there or switch to human mode.The light is triggered manually. If I really cared I would have taken off a star but I don’t need that feature.Note the 2c has a siren but only for alerts. The Eufycam 2 has a siren for tampering which is nice. Haven’t tested either siren.Charge it up when you receive. I started at 40% out of the box but it dropped quick. Again almost returned it. But I charged to 100% and it’s been fine since then.There is only motion and human motion detection. Kept seeing AI mentioned for face detection, neither camera had that (I had hoped the Eufycam 2 had it). Alerts do try and show a face if it caught one, but not the face identification I read about.Eufycam 2 has better battery and that tamper siren, but other than that not much difference (size shape etc). So I’d suggest buying when there is a good deal and buy two sets while at it for the extra hub.","So I'm updating my previous review from last year from 4 stars to 5. I love Eufy products and have cameras, smart bulbs, vacuums, etc. Was having an issue with these cameras falsely reporting motion when the camera would wake from its sleep mode, that would cause tons of motion alerts 24/7. Worked with their support for a while but didnt seem to have a fix at the time. Now 6 months later their support reached out to me that they pushed new code and to check it now, it does seem they resolved the issue. I recommend Eufy all the time because of their top notch customer support and they have great products at a great price.","My wife bought this as my birthday present. What I really liked this so far is the over box and camera design and user experience. The package seemed really classy from the plastic wrap (tightened) to the unfolding of the corrugated lid.The item I got were HomeBase and the two cameras 2C. The installation was fairly easy and quick.

We have had a problem with people breaking into our cars so we needed to find a camera that wouldn’t damage the outside of the building but was also reliable enough to capture images if someone tried to break into our cars again. This camera does all of that and more it’s weather proof it can be connected by WiFi only or you can run a Ethernet cord to it if you want. There is minimal damage to the building and the pictures are great. If you throw a SIM card in it you can record notifications And videos of movement and the images are not blurry or cloudy at all, even in the rain you still get a pretty decent picture. I would say the night vision is almost better than the regular Image and we have absolutely no lights outside our building so it is dark. It connects easily to the app and the other cameras we have inside our house. For the price you can’t beat it.","I don't usually like leaving product reviews until the product has exceeded my expectations and I feel like that it was money well spent.

The system is really easy to install. The quality was great. Wifi connection to NVR is really great we can see basically no delay at all. The mobile app was a bit difficult to configure but still answer the basic need for remote monitor.The attached photo is from our backyard where anything on the grass is dark and really hard to see but the camera said otherwise. Great Product.,"""3TB HDD Pre-Instal - Hiseeu Wireless Security Camera System, 8CH 1080P NVR 4Pcs Outdoor/Indoor WiFi Surveillance Camera with Night Vision, Waterproof, Motion Alert, Remote Access"" model WXKIT-8HB611-1T.**I will only try to point out some things not discussed in the description andFirst this is an EIGHT CAMERA system so don't be confused by the ""4pcs"" in the description.Second, I sent an email question to their customer service and received a response in less then 24hrs - VERY GOOD.Third, this is a Standalone system running Linux which gets rid of the BLOATWARE/SNIFFING of Windows and Chrome, etc. 'nuf said on my opinions of Goggle and Microsoft.Second, BUY the system with ALL the cameras (8 max) so that you have 'Spares"" bought cheap as a 'kit.' I have used 6 in my system to date. The Camera Software has display settings for 8 camera windows, 6, 4, and so on.Third, the Cameras housing, adjustment arm and base are 'cast metal' (not plastic) very well made. I specifically chose ones with good 'hoods' as several of my units would be hit by the sun and typically would bleach out the image.Forth, the camera's field of view is very good and clarity range is as far as it shows. There is no flutter in the images after 4 months installed. The automatic 'white balance' is the best I have seen on NUMEROUS systems including Commercial versions. This comes into play when it goes B/W for night vision. On that note, there is a 'electric eye' on the front that actually switches the Camera mode too which does NOT rely on software to make that determination and uses decades old established 'eye' tech for delay - i.e. doesn't switch back & forth and does not get effected by passing headlights etc. This is the BEST manner in my opinion and you can actually HEAR the switch when you cover the eye with your finger!Fifth, the NIGHT VISION of the camera is exceptional for a non-commercial unit. It uses THREE ""infra-red illuminator"" LEDs (shown in picture) that are very strong (bottom ""led"" is actually the electric eye). The 65 feet is correctly advertised. However there is a hotspot because the LEDs are not shining 'spread out' as far as camera's field of view. This is an issue with ALL infra-red Iluminators as the Infra-red light is such a small band of light energy - that's why your TV remote does not work from a distance or if you don't point it at the TV when your batteries are low. If you need to see further or wider, you will need to invest in separate ACTUAL Infra-Red Iluminators and place them as needed. Note that I have overlapping cameras and each 'see' the others Infra-Red spots.Sixth, Make a CAMERA MAP and plot locations as well as which camera goes where. The system comes FULLY SET UP however, having done this before, I plugged in the entire system on a table, started it up and determined which cameras were 1-8 and LABELED them. Then made sure to put them in the order I wanted them DISPLAYED so when turned it all on, it was only the matter of alignment. I have three in one location alone giving over 180 degree coverage. Those are 150ft away from the base unit and still have a SOLID 3 of 4 bars wifi.Last, I did not need any internet connections (etc.) so have no input there.PS. the noise is typical of just a Hard Drive head indexing and is not loud but it will transfers through its cabinet to a hard surface and becomes a 'sounding board' making it out to be louder than it actually is, which you can fix by putting some soft 'feet' on it. The intermittent indexing does make sleeping around it a little funny. The best step would be to offer SSD when the prices come down as they are noiseless and have a better longevity in a constant ""write"" hard derive scenario such as this.","So, let's review, right?Well, when I bought it, of course the price was right, but I was worried that It was on the cheap side, and that it might reflect in the quality. The answer is NO. This was well worth the value. After 2 years, still working just fine.Now, Let's talk about it.Basically, it's pretty easy. Unwrap everything. Grab a network cable, a power strip, and a HDMI or VGA monitor.Once you have those things, plug it all in. DVR to the network, power and HDMI/VGa and a mouse (included but crap), and the cameras all in to the power strip. Turn it all on at once.When everything is on, the cameras should already show up on the screen in a grid. You have to set a password (make it easy, no keyboard). Then walk through the Wizard. Set the time, give it an IP or DHCP (easy instructions included)**. When it says ONLINE, you are done. You can tweak it anyway you want, but honestly, that's about it.There's also a QR code that it displays to download the app for mobile access, and there is one that connects the DVR to your phone. I dowloaded the iPhone app, then clicked 'add DVR' then pointed my phone to the QR code... and in about 5 seconds, the phone showed my cameras.** If you have a router that supports uPNP, use it. It will make things easier.The reason I am posting a review now is because of a recent issue I had. I came home one night to find the DVR had been stuck in a reboot. It would load the startup screen, then reboot. After an EMAIL to their SUPPORT, I was given some options to reset a setting, reboot, and try again. This didn't work, so they sent me a new firmware. That corrected the problem, and I was back online.In many cases, a company would simply tell me that 2 years was over-warranty. I really appreciated that they were able to provide support.I should mention, they do not speak fluent english, so there was a little assumption and muddling I had to go through to understand some of the instructions, but overall. Very impressed.","I ordered this system last year and to my shame it sat in the box till now. I've had a lot of time to do my pet projects and this was one of them. So finally I got it out and after reading reviews of how wireless camera systems were difficult to setup I was dreading the fight. However, no fighting needed. I hooked it up to the tv and plugged it into 120VAC. I plugged in the cameras to 120VAC in different parts of my house in window locations. I then turned on my tv and switched to the HDMI port of the Control Unit of the system. Once again to my surprise I saw my screen divided into squares for each camera powered up. I didn't fight with it at all! Apparently the system is automatically keyed to recognize its cameras and any extra cameras you try connect to the system must be wired. It is still early in my installation and I am trying things out yet. I ran an ethernet cable to the Control Unit and will be trying out accessing from my phone and computer. It looks like you can manually access it over the internet if you know the IP Address and ports of cameras or you can download the software app and use the software to access cameras and schedule recording. I would recommend this system.","I purchased this system recently for my property,At first I was a little hesitant buying a system off Amazon, but then did my due diligence research on the system and Hiseeu as well as tried asking some pre-sale questions to their support to see how efficient support really was. (They did a great job of answering questions)I have been pleasantly surprised with the system as a whole.Setup was very easy as the cameras come preloaded to match the system. (I encourage a new buyer to setup all of the cameras and system in one room first before installing them, This will allow you to identify camera 1 thru 8; although the cameras can be easily reassigned)Once setup, the Admin Menu is pretty easy to understand and work with, so no difficulties there. The viewing “Phone App’ works well, with sharp images that I can now view when I’m away from the house.All in All, I recently had a 900.00 System that I used, and I have found the Hiseeu system is practically the same and for 1\2 the money,I will say though, that I will come back after a month of operation and either update this review or add a new one so I can comment on the stability and connectivity of the System.Note to Potential Buyers:Read the Product description, Hiseeu offers an additional 8% off if you email them for a code before the sale, To me; that was the final item that had me land on them for a product.",228,53,https://www.amazon.com/HisEEu-Wireless-Security-Surveillance-Pre-Install/dp/B0757FLCRZ/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=wireless+security+cameras&qid=1640229254&sr=8-16

(Original: Can’t set it up),No monthly fees,"Over the last 8 years I’ve had Nest, Ring camera systems and now Eufy. It’s been an expensive journey. The high costs of devices and then the yearly subscription. Living in the country a security system brings peace of mind. With Nest and Ring, good cameras, but the time it takes to view a notification is terrible, especially away from home. Eufy has resolved that issue for me. At home the notification is fast and access to view what it’s about just as fast. Away from home it’s fast as well and a relief not to get a message “activating device” any longer. Day time quality of the 2C Pro camera is excellent, nighttime is as well, with one exception not published anywhere. The camera needs background light help. A motion detect security light in the area is a must if you want to record an event and see a good picture. For me not a problem, the barn has one. I like this system so far.","(Updated at the end with a different outcome)So far the motion detection is not good , keeps alerting to vehicles outside the activity zone and missed me walking inside the activity zone and missed UPS also inside the activity zone. I’m testing the rest of the cameras.Updated May 15 2021 , The camera has missed sending me alerts 3 times while driving in and out of my garage is not alerting to the activity zone. However is alerting to almost every car that drives out of the zone either on people alert only or alert to all movement . I see no difference it keeps missing the important area and alerting to the area I don’t want .Updated 5/22/21 switched cameras to see if that particular camera was defective and the next one is still missing amazon drivers walking inside my activity zone but alerts to lots and lots of vehicle way far out and away from my activity zone .Eufy needs to work on this issue missing people walking in my property is a BIG deal! I will try another brand half the price and update here so buyers are informed.June 9, 2121 I contacted Eufy and a representative reviewed my videos he or she told me how to fix the problem, for some reason the cameras trigger alerts when they have an obstacle to close to them so I installed longer arms to 3 of them and placed the fourth one in a different position and guess what... Not a single false alert!!! Unbelievable, I even had to apologize to the representative because I tough the recommendation made no sense but it worked. As for the other brand it worked almost the same way buy did not record as long as Eufy so not only I am staying with Eufy but I am buying more of their new products that will be available this year.",,"Updated:After two calls to text support and a very helpful neighbor, we got the home base set up. Once that hurdle was cleared the rest was easy. The cameras were fast to set up and I encountered no issues. I will say the setup voice could be less loud and more conversational, but not a dealbreaker. I was hoping for a bit more movement to the mounts. I didn’t get as much clearance from the house, so I’ll probably have to move a few cameras later.The real win here is HomeKit support. It took some time and exploration as you have to do it on each camera, but adding them to our home was fast and easy. Much happier with this setup over our old Arlo cameras.I will say I made a very smart purchase on getting solar panels for each camera. I placed them at 90% and they quickly went to 100%. No need to worry about changing batteries ever again!Original post: What good is a device if you can’t set it up?I’m replacing our existing Arlo setup with Eufy for HomeKit support. Got the device and went to set it up today. I’ve tried for about an hour to set it up, but I can only get as far as naming the homebase 2 before it tells me it can’t be named and it can’t check for firmware.Ugh.So I call support and we cycle the router, restart the Wi-Fi (standard) and we still can’t get it to work. So he tells me to wait until later as it could be an issue on their end. Even offered to replace the homebase, but he can’t guarantee that one won’t work.The guy was nice. Very helpful. But on Black Friday, this needs to work. I can’t even troubleshoot the problem and all I know is that it’s not my setup as the dozen other smart devices are working just fine.So, how useful is a system that you can’t set up? Not useful at all. I’ll give it a few hours, but as first impressions go, this is a bad one.","I’ve been looking for a wireless security camera system but have been hesitant because most require a monthly subscription. I came across this product and am very happy so far. Clear video, easy to use app and no monthly fees!One of my cameras has had sub par battery life. I just contacted Alexandra from eufy support.

After reading many reviews, I knew I did not want the yuppie consumer brands - I wanted a real surveillance system, based solely on technical specifications and durability. I finally developed my requirements: wireless, NVR with monitor, 2TB hard-drive local storage, 1080p or better, 8 channel, two-way audio, quality phone app, powered (not battery), H.265 compression, motion detection, PIR cameras, night vision, IP67 weatherproof / pre-paired cameras for easy setup.After setting the bar so high, I landed on the Yeskamo product. Still, I expected problems -- there always with this kind of project. But to my utter amazement, everything went off very smoothly and perfectly. I mounted the cameras, got power to each spot, setup the NVR monitor, and then the first time I turned it on, everything worked. Every camera synchronized to the NVR without a hitch. The user manual, and on-screen navigation, were very intuitive and easy to understand. I was done learning and configuring in less than an hour.For your reference, I live in a 3200 sqft brick house. All cameras are outside on first floor and the NVR is inside, middle of house, second floor. That means the longest signal length is about 60 feet through brick, floor/ceiling, and 2-4 interior walls. I had no problems whatsoever – signal strength and visual accuracy, were perfect right from the start. Lastly, I setup the iphone app, and again expected hassles. But again there were none – the app setup was as easy as they get, then I put in my system ID, and had visual on my phone in less than 10 minutes. Local storage is great, the floodlights are just the right intensity to not be overwhelming, and the switch from night-vision to color floodlight recordings is very cool.Lastly, I work in IT and I am never impressed with technology products – I never write reviews. However, this time, I felt it was important to tell you all – there are some products out there that live up to their promise, and Yeskamo has been that for me. I have been so happy with this product and the installation experience that I am already expanding to 8 cameras. One done, 3 more to go, again everything was super smooth. In the end, I would recommend this product to anyone.","We bought these security cameras to protect our home from any intruders when we’re out or during the night. The cameras and monitor are really impressive. The monitor looks very modern and simple. It also have a HDMI port for even possible to an external monitor. The cameras are great quality builds and have excellent, clear picture quality, even at night (with or without the floodlights on). The 6 leds on the cameras makes a big difference to viewing in the evening, this is only enhanced even more with the floodlight is triggered, it creates a good quality of light and in turn great picture. This kit is a complete set up with everything needed to set up and get going in less than an hour including mounting the cameras outside the home. Connecting the cameras to the monitor is easy and once connection is recognised the system is up and running. The signal between cameras and monitor is strong and reliable even with a fair distance between them. And the phone app works really great. I really like that I can talk to the people in the video and that they can respond too. The system supports up to 8 cameras, which is great and I am planning to get extra 4 more cameras from YESKAMO soon.The package also comes with a detailed user manual which is perfect for me, because I don't really know much about computers, never mind setting up a security system! Overall, this is a fantastic product and I would recommend.","I’ve had this camera system for 5 months now and I’ve been wanting to write a review and always got side tracked on other things. So, better late then never.The NVR is an eight-channel system and is supplied with four cameras. That leaves room for four more cameras in the future. The cameras are 1080P and deliver such a magnificent and crisp view in the recordings.This is one of the few systems that offers an All-In-One design. Having the monitor attached to the NVR makes for a clean looking installation. The NVR can be placed anywhere in the house and look good. The cameras each have a warning siren and spotlights that can selected to use. I prefer not to have an audible alarm with motion (cats do set these off) but when the system is armed I want any notifications sent to me.The camera spot lights work as they should. As I leave the house and head to the driveway spot lights are coming on and following me on the way. One neighbor noticed it and make a comment about how nice it must be to have motion lights setup like that. He didn’t even suspect they were security cameras with spotlights and I didn’t tell him any different. The HD black and white night vision is truly clear, and the HD Color day images are just fantastic. The motion detection is easily setup and alerts come fast to our phones.The camera system was a breeze to setup. Turn on the NVR, start powering up the cameras, and since every camera was already paired to the NVR I immediately started getting video displayed. I set everything up inside the house first so the NVR and camera were handy to make changes. I experimented with several of the options offered and finally decided how they would be setup outside.Mounting the cameras went quick, anchors and screws were supplied with each camera. When I ordered the system I also ordered a couple of power extension cables because a couple of cameras weren’t going to be close to an outlet. I already had the app working on my phone from playing with the cameras inside the house so as we mounted each one I could monitor it on my phone to nail down exactly where to point them, and get them level.I made a list of pros and cons to try to cover all facets entirely. I hope this helps someone to make an informed camera decision and, in my opinion, Yeskamo should be strongly considered.Pros:1. Simple and fast setup. Any question I had about using the NVR software was answered the next day. I asked them several questions at once as I went through the menu’s and had large emails full of questions that I would send and they would always send me a quick reply and answer each item on my list. I am quite happy with the service I received and rate it second to none.2. The cameras have metal casings instead of plastic. Feels like a well-engineered and manufactured product. Lately we are now having 90+ days and earlier we had the winter freeze. These cameras have operated flawlessly and they have not skipped a beat at all.3. Fast motion alerts to our phones. The alerts show up within seconds to each of our phones. I know this is some what of an issue with many other brands. Poor to no alerts with others, but we have had good reliable alerts with Yeskamo. I have the alerts from the cameras setup with a special notification ring tone so we know when an alert is coming from our security system so it doesn't get ignored like many other notifications do.4. The PC software for WIN 10 installed nicely and works well with the NVR. Just to note, this system does not require an Internet connection to work. The Internet connection is only required for off site monitoring. We have it setup this way and appreciate that we can take a look at our house anytime and anywhere we are (as long as we have an internet connection). Either way, the NVR stores all for us to review locally when back at home.5. Before purchasing I contacted Yeskamo to have the manuals and data sheets sent to me so I could get a look at the documentation they supplied. They answered my email within a day and sent the requested documents immediately. I thought that was very respectable of Yeskamo. They offered their help with any more information I needed or any questions I might have before committing to a purchase.6. If I could rate their customer support on its own it would have to be 10 out 10. They were there to answer my questions before and after buying their product. I had no previous experience with security cameras so I asked about every little thing I didn’t know (which was plenty) but everything was answered plainly for me. Many times examples were sent to better explain the options / settings I was inquiring about.7. The supplied 2TB hard drive records all 4 cameras 24/7 for about 50 days. Plenty of time to go back and view an event that happened in the past. We have done this too many times to mention.8. In an ordinary setup each camera connects directly to the NVR. In some setups a camera might be too far to connect well to the NVR directly so with Yeskamo it can be connected through a camera that have a good connection back to the NVR. I did not need to use this; all of my cameras have good signal strength to the NVR. Just wanted to mention it if others are having trouble with a camera or two. Yeskamo also sends a strong antenna to use on a camera in place of the one installed on the camera. It allows the antenna to be mounted away from the camera. I did not need this either, but I am sure many people will appreciate having this suppled with the kit.Con:1. OK, I had a camera problem. Had the IR Led’s on a camera not turning on when the camera switch into night mode. Contacted support and they had a camera shipped right away as a replacement. Yeskamo support is in China but they have a warehouse facility in California and cameras are stocked there. So, the replacement camera was sent priority from California and I received it like two days later. Believe me, when you have a failure in your security system you need a company that responds quickly to resolve it.2. The speaker/microphone works best when the other person is in close proximity of the camera, otherwise don’t plan to use this for communication. Not a deal breaker for me since my cameras are mounted quite a ways from the entry they are monitoring so the 2-way communication didn’t work.3. The connectors are located on the bottom of the NVR so not easy to get to. For the USB port that I use to connect my jump drive for saving video clips I added a small 4 port USB breakout box ($3). This way I can leave it connected to the USB port on the NVR all the time and when I need to connect a jump drive for backups / file saving I easily plug into the USB breakout box instead of trying to get to the NVR USB port under it. Also, the HDMI connector is very tight on the bottom. I use the HDMI output from the NVR to display on a large screen TV located close to the NVR. The connector and jacket on my HDMI cable was just too long to bend it to fit under the NVR without force so I bought a couple of HDMI right angle connectors (about $4) that came with 90º and 270º angled connectors to be sure the right one is provided. Now my HDMI cable is installed without any force on it or the HDMI connector on the NVR.Overall: This has been a learning curve for me, and I can say I understand a system setup far more than I ever thought I would. Yeskamo has been a partner with me in this journey and I extremely thank them for their help and support.One more thing, a little careful planning up front will save you a lot of grief later. I had mine so messed up I just started over once. But the second time I had a better plan and knew what I wanted to do better than the first time. There is a Restore Factory settings but use it wisely.","I purchased this security system almost a year ago and let me tell you althought I bumped into a few problems, I don't regret my purchase and would not only purchase again but will recommend 100 % to others looking for a complete security system at such affordable price.Pros: First off I'd like to tell people that I live in Puerto Rico and makes it difficult to obtain warranty from alot of companies because of the fact that we are thought of as overseas when we are actually US territory but the Yeskamo authorized seller made sure on various occasions that my issues or concerns were taking care of fully. So know that you are going to ne well taking care of by this seller. They have the best customer service! Moving foward to the system let me tell you that I love it. Once you get a hang of how everything works its easy and if you ever bump into a question contact support and it will be addressed fast. I love the fact that you get a complete system. 4 camaras, monitor, antennas, cables, hardware, all you need to get your home or business protected wireless. The monitor will have to be connected to lan and power and ofcoarse camaras need power also but the monitor and camaras connect wirelessly. What I love most is the floodlights going on at night when it detects motion and the siren it emits to scare off intruders or animals. I get to see movements around my house 24/7 on monitor and cel phone. Not to mention it comes with enough memory to hold off atleast 2 weeks before it resets.Cons: Although you can speak through camaras on cellphone, you can hear person in front of camara clearly but you can't hear person load enough thats on other end. Voice dont sound loud and clear emitting from camara. But thos feature for me is no big deal just part of the extras. 1 camara out of 4 didnt hold rain and it went blurry for months when I decided to contact customer service for repair and it got replaced with a new one without hassle of returning old one. 2 of my camaras kept loosing signal and I got sent partial refund to buy signal boosters.And thats all. The cons are no big deal due to the excellent customer service this company has and trust me when I tell you, they have your back fully 100% no matter what the issue is they always find the best resolution. So don't overthink and submit your purchase now!! I promise you wont regret it =)",521,165,https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Security-Floodlight-Spotlight-Surveillance/dp/B07XTHQXQF/ref=sr_1_12?keywords=wireless+security+cameras&qid=1640229254&sr=8-12

Great video quality. Easy to setup.,"I bought this system a couple months ago. I originally bought two other systems that arrived with problems, and I had to send them back for a refund. After doing a little more research, I bought this system for my small business. I unpacked the unit and tested it out at home before taking it to the business for installation. Before installation, I chose to purchase a new wifi router, which was quite an upgrade from what was already there, installed wifi extenders where the wifi signals were weak and tested the system and all cameras to be sure everything was working properly and recording. Once I was comfortable with the system, setting it up and installing it in the business was easy. The unit is installed on the second floor, and the cameras on the first floor, all the way to the back of the building, still work with no issues. I did not have to use the extended antennas that came in the box. I did have some questions for the company. The phone number and email are posted here at the bottom of the product description on Amazon, so finding contact information is easy. I chose to email the company, and within 24 hours or less I received a response. I needed assistance getting the system to display on a computer screen. Tech support sent a link to download the software along with instructions on how to set it up. I clicked on the link, downloaded the software, followed the install instructions, and all cameras popped up on our computer screen. The 3TB hard drive gives my business 30 days of recording, which is better than we expected. We have all 8 cameras set to record continuously 24/7. This is a great buy for the money.",I have been in the alarm industry for over 40 years but getting your company to install cameras (even at cost) is ridiculously expensive. I purchased these cameras just prior to our completing a remodel on our home and just started the installation. It was incredibly easy with essentially just plug and play set up. The pictures during the day (and night) are crystal clear and playback is extremely simple. The best issue is that I had some issues with the distance for the wireless reaching and have had incredibly quick response to each and every request for assistance. The system is simple but when there is an issue is is nice to have instant responses to your inquires for help. 5 star customer service and five star system. Really user friendly at all levels and I would recommend to anyone!,"I ordered the security system February 1, 2019 but just installed in on April 13th. The system is a Hiseeu with 8 1080P cameras and a 3TB hard drive. The system worked flawlessly right of the box.

Still Works!,"Update On Dec 15, 2020",Great system,Nice system,"Hiseeu 8 Channel Expandable w/12"" Monitor Wireless Security Camera System","We purchased this to give us security while living in a rural area. This has it's own wifi system that communicates from the monitor to the cameras. So if you have no wifi, it will still work. If you want to view from your phone, then you would need to plug the monitor into the router. It was very easy to set up. We just plugged in the cameras to power, and it communicated with the monitor. The cameras came up on the monitor. We bought a 4 camera system, but will probably add 4 more cameras. It was an excellent choice!","This is my first home video security system. I researched many systems before purchasing it. The features that I insisted upon were good video definition, night vision, significant storage capacity, and wireless connectivity between the cameras and the NVR (network video recorder). A good friend of mine showed me his system which was wireless but the cameras ran on batteries which he had to replace frequently. I knew I did not want a system that ran on batteries; this one requires a physical connection to house wiring for power. It comes with plug-in transformers for each camera and one for the NVR. There is also an antenna with a 10 foot cable for one camera if it is installed in an area that cannot penetrate through too many walls. This antenna allows you to place it in an area that is less obstructed. It works great! I bought the system with the 12 inch monitor which I think is the best combination. It eliminates the need to incorporate a laptop or television to view images from the cameras. (My system came with 4 cameras.) The monitor is a self-contained unit which includes a 3 Terrabyte hard drive and the electronics which run the system. It provides storage for 30 days of high definition video from all 4 cameras. It comes with a two-button mouse which works with the monitor and system just like a desktop or laptop computer system. I purchased 2 Vanxsecctv 10m(30 ft) 2.1x5.5mm CC 12volt Power Extension Cables for CCTV Security Cameras. These let me run power to 2 of my cameras that were not near power supplies. Also, I took advantage of the 8% Hiseeu discount offer just by sending an email to Johnny@hiseeu.com and requesting it. They replied within a few hours with the discount code which I successfully used. I am amazed at the night-vision capability of this system. The specifications say it has a 65 foot limitation but that is not the case. I have one camera aimed straight down our driveway which is about 120 feet long and it ""sees"" that far in total darkness. The detail is surprising! I bought the 3-year extended warranty (just in case). I can highly recommend this system.Update on June 5, 2020 If I could rate this system with more than 5 stars, I would. I am continuously impressed with the quality of this system. My wife, who is not technically gifted, loves to use the system to keep watch on our outdoor cats. We have observed several night critters meandering around our property that we would not have had any notion of their presence without this system. The company has contacted me by email to ask me how the system is working. If you are unsure of which home security system to buy I don't think you could go wrong with this one!Update on Dec 15, 2020One disappointing aspect of this system that I just found out is that it will only record 4 channels at a time. I added a 5th camera to the system and could view it just fine. I could not figure out how to record the new camera so I contacted the company. They responded within hours and told me it only records 4 channels. You can choose which 4 channels but if you have more than 4 they will not record. I am OK with that but the information in the system description is misleading. I'm sorry if my endorsement of this system has caused anyone else to be mislead too.","After a bit of a learning curve, this security system is a wonderful system. Great picture quality and with the 3TB hard drive, it records continuously for nearly 30 days. We've only had it for a little over a month and have recorded one suspicious person walking around our home while we were at work. We also purchased an audio camera that we have inside our home to keep an eye on our pets while we're away. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FVSK6BY?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_asin_imageInstalling the cameras may require some work, depending on where you want them located around your home.

Contacted seller through Amazon and they immediately sent the correct item and an RMA for the wrong one. Must have used express because I rec'd it in 2 days. Then I had trouble getting system setup. I had an 8 channel system ,same brand, that I was wanting to upgrade so knew a bit about setup. This was supposed to be easier, just plug and play. But it was only loading some cameras and then losing connection and I could not get all 6 cameras to function properly. I contacted seller again late on a Saturday night and informed them I thought NVR was faulty. That began a series of 15 to 20 emails and replies over the next 2 1/2 days working on system.. support saying he thought it was interference because he could access the NVR and it looked good...I still believed it to be NVR as I could NEVER get all 6 cameras on. Finally I got up in middle of night Monday night and tried one more time before I was going to demand refund... In the dark I discovered that as odd as it sounds 2 of the 6 power adapters were defective( at least 1 of those was an old one of mine) This wasn't readily evident because I had 2 good ones in computer room and when I got camera connected to NVR I moved the camera to other areas where th bad adaptesr were and never used same ones so didnt catch the fault. and support wasnt aware that I was connecting cameras to a different adapter when camera went supposed off line... after fixing that issue all was good and I now have all 6 cameras running and doing GREAT. Support was helpful and patient and always answered email within an hour os so... was very impressed with interaction with the support personnel... and am very pleased with this Xmarto system. I've used Xmarto for at least 8 or 9 years and they are always dependable and have good quality pictures. The night vision cameras have worked for years now without loosing quality. The first system I had 10-12 years ago cost twice as much and the night vision cameras had to be replaced every 2-3 years as they deteriorated that badly.","I bought my original XMarto system for a friend many years ago, at the same time I bought a system for my own property security, both systems are still working perfectly with no deuteriation whatsoever, and very little maintenance and trouble free..I recently bought a new 8 channel system as there systems have gone ahead in leap's and bounds in every respect, and I wanted to add PTZ. I removed my old system and installed the new system and right out of the box everything worked perfectly, new system only came with 4 cameras so I used 4 of my old cameras, same thing, joined the new system no problem.There old software apps were a bit dicky, but it seems that all the bugs are out as the new apps are working perfectly.The images on my monitor, television and my phone are outstanding and the security aspect is excellent, just make sure you use a very strong password.","Recently my family member purchased a house and needed a surveillance camera system to be installed on doors and garage. Private installation companies were too expensive, so decided to set up a DIY system. Found this camera within the budget and it was mentioned that easy to install.

Word of advice for Comcast / Xfinity subscribers -- when stepping through the set-up Wizard, selecting the option to text an activation code is a joke -- the code is only good for 15 minutes but I didn't receive the text until 30 minutes had passed; just stick with your Xfinity account name for the activation and provisioning.Xfinity upgraded to DOCSIS 3.1, and, while my own 6 year old trusty Motorola Surfboard SB6580 was working fine, Xfinity found every reason to pester me about an upgrade and how much I'm missing not having a 3.1 modem lease an upgrade. I prefer to own my own modem, so, after perusing compatible modems for my region on Xfinity's approved device page, I narrowed my choices to the ARRIS Surfboard SB8200, Netgear CM1000, and, this, the Motorola MB8600. All three are comparable at 1001 Mbps, 32 down x 8 up DOCSIS channels, and DOCSIS 3.1.All the cool kids love the Arris -- especially after they ditched the very problematic Intel PUMA chipset and went with the Broadcom's offering -- and for very good reasons, it has great hardware specs. Sporting 3GB of RAM, 128MB /16 of NAND flash memory it's a tasty treat. And, were it not a horrific white box that clashes with everything in my apartment, I'd happily have purchased it.Vanity, thy name be Monkey Rat, I know.I've never had a lot of love for Netgear, and, I found its hardware lacking -- 128 MB of flash memory and 256 MB of RAM. Ultimately not a huge game changer, with current theoretical home speeds at 1Gb, but one would expect something a tad more, well, more from a name like Netgear. While its feature rich -- which, is saying something for a cable modem -- I really saw no reason to down this path.That clashing white Arris was looking tastier at this point.Then I compared the MB8600 to both and found a happy place. 512 MB of RAM and 128 MB of NAN -- a buck cheaper than the Netgear with a doubling of the RAM, and while not as expensive -- marginally -- than the Arris, and certainly lacking a bit in the hardware department, but I paid more for future ability to bond upwards of 4 separate lines. However, the LACP technology requires a higher end router, and faster than a gig speed isn't necessarily right around the corner, but, this device positioned nicely for a future with a potential of 4Gb.Word of caution -- it's a BIG device. If you're familiar with the older Surfboards, this is easily double the size in height and does not come with any sort of mounting option. However, it has great ventilation thanks to a well aired grid pattern on the side.So, how does it work? My internet plan is the BLAST! 150 Mbps (stop laughing) -- and i assure you, I've never seen that even in the dead of night -- wired speeds show an increase on speedtest.net but it's not really all that noticeable, whether plugged in directly to the cable modem or my ASUS RT-AC86U router, notebook and desktop performance were negligible. However, wireless performance for my nVidia SHIELD K1 tablet and Google Pixel 2 phone were significantly improved - I found this a little odd as they're still going through a router, but, I can't argue with results.I keep forgetting the MB8600 has a baked in spectrum analyzer utility I need to check out -- I'll add an update when I do.Ultimately, I like it -- I play Everquest (the original) and noted better response times, but again, the MS aren't earth shaking or setting the sky afire. Stream the occasional movie, and really I don't have any complaints, and can only praise the device for its eye-popping Wi-Fi boost, for which I have no good explanation.I may change out my Cat5e for Cat6 and upgrade my router next -- hopefully wringing a couple more Mbps out. But, really, I think it's time to call xfinity and have to do some line tests. I will provide updates on that as well.","I have xfinity performance pro which is rated for 150 mb/s down and 5 mb/s up. I've been using the Arris SB6141 modem which is 8 channel down x 4 channel up, great modem, no issues but it's speed maxed out at 120 mb/s down and 5 mb/s up. I figured what the heck might as well get the speed i'm paying for, so I purchased the Motorola SB7621 which is 24 channel down x 8 channel up. Internet speed is now 180mb/s down and 6mb/s up with a ping of 19ms. I am happy that I am now getting the speed I am paying for. Yes the upload speed didn't change much but that is because xfinity does not support 8 channel up in my area. This means even though this modem supports 8 channel up it only shows 4 active up channels when you log into it, this is not the modems fault, this is xfinity's doing. The download channels are fine, all 24 channels show up and are active. Yes, I could have purchased a 16 channel down and 4 channel up modem and received the same current speeds but at the time of purchase this modem was less than or the same amount as all the 16 x 4 modems. By buying this Motorola I can upgrade my internet speed down the road and still be covered. Another good thing is that this modem has the Broadcom chipset not the Intel puma.The modem comes with good instructions and is well packaged. Setup was a breeze. I didn't have to call xfinity. All I did after I hooked up just the modem to my PC was navigate to motorola.com which brought up the xfinity activation page. Then just log in with your xfinity credentials and follow the prompts. Very easy and welcomed as I didn't want to sit on the phone talking to xfinity support.I never do reviews but I figured this little box deserved one and hopefully this helps someone.","Great product. Works as advertised. Instruction manual is terrible but Motorola support is too notch.To use with Comcast / Xfinity:1) plug in modem, attach coax, and connect port 1 to a laptop with Ethernet cord2) go to xfinity setup webpage on your laptop and enter account credentials to activate modem (web page address is in instruction manual)3) modem will reset and then you should have wired web connectivity with your laptop4) unplug modem power, disconnect laptop and connect terminal 1 of modem with Ethernet cable to your router with router powered on, and then plug in modem power5) after plugging in modem it will reboot and then your wifi should now work.Tips:1) you may need to factory reset your router to get it to connect with this modem. I had to reset my apple time capsule reuter2) this is a bridge modem, so you must power it down before connecting a router. Plug in router to modem and give router power, and then plug in modem power3) only one port can be used. The rest are for bridging signals once that functionality is available from ISP. You can only use one of the four Ethernet ports on the rear","Speaking as a cable technician for one of the larger companies out there, this runs cooler (less heat produced, more efficient with electricity) and more stable (doesn't drop off nearly as easily due to low dBmV or low MER signal issues) than the rental Ubee, Technicolor, and Arris models my company ""includes for free with your package"". And yes, the AQM also works with the Cisco CMTS we use are our hubs currently, at least in my city that I work in. I bought one myself in December, it's been running a server without interruptions. Of course any line damage or RF leakage issues will still need repairs, but I've seen it more than once with weak signal on the coax (sometimes even negative dBmV levels from the tap), but yet this modem stays locked on without issues. That's impressive, and only one or two rental model modems we offer (which are exclusive to business class, not residential customers) gets close to that feat. Any one-star reviews you see here are likely going to be significant leakage issues inside or outside the home, almost never the modem itself with a well-made model like this MB8600.If the manufacturer changes who is designing & making this (i.e.: no longer Motorola engineering), I will update this review. Until then, 5-stars and my non-official (can't speak on behalf of the company I work for of course) but personal experienced-based approval.","This cable modem is a beast (in a good way)! A little over 7 years ago, I bought the Motorola SB6120 to replace the crummy cable modem that Comcast charged me monthly to use. I had no problems with the SB6120, but got an email from Xfinity saying I needed to upgrade my equipment. I guess because they have increased the speed on my service and the SB6120 is so old it may not be supported with updates from Motorola. OK...I paid $75 for the SB6120 and it probably saved me over $750 in monthly rental for 7+ years.Decide first if you want DOCSIS 3.0 or 3.1 because the Docsis 3.1 is new and will probably be usable for years to come. Motorola only has 1 Docsis 3.1 cable modem available today which is the MB8600 and is almost twice the price of the Docsis 3.0 MB7621. If you compare the specs, the MB8600 is faster but at nominal 1000 Mbps and Comcast certified 400 Mbps, the MB7621 is way faster than my 150 Mbps service.I got it today and got it activated and hooked up to my new Motorola MR1700 router. The process was fast and easy if you can figure what they are trying to say in the quick start guide. I activated with my notebook directly connected to the cable modem and the speed exceeded my 150 Mbps service by almost 30%. After direct wire of my notebook through the router, my speed was also exceeding my service speed at the same level.The only way I can lose on this purchase is if Docsis 3.0 becomes obsolete in less than 8 months and I'll bet that is unlikely.",18539,2,https://www.amazon.com/MOTOROLA-Approved-Comcast-Gigablast-MB8600/dp/B0723599RQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=xfinity+security+cameras&qid=1640229643&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&smid=A1JCDPLP2335KA&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVlU4R0RGSFM5SkYzJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDUyOTY1M0VOOEtNSjRUNFNNTSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTAyMDMxNExXRlRRVjY0N1c3JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

Amazing customer service....,"Great product, great experience",You get product that worth more than its price w awesome customer service,Great customer service !,Better than i expected.,"So I wanted to put up some security cameras just for some added protection. I went with this system because it came with 2 1080p cameras and a 1080n dvr with a 1tb hard drive. Overall the system works great. Awesome picture quality in the day and great picture at night. I want to say it was easy to install but there is always going to be an issue with finding a place to make a hole to run the cable. After it was all set up I turned it on. Out of the box the picture quality was just Ok. Only a few issues with picture being to bright or fuzzy. I then went through the menus and found all kinds of setting to mess with. After a few days and nights of adjusting and a lot of online reading I was able to get the quality up to 1080p standards. The only complaint I would have is that is doesn’t come with a book telling you what all the settings do. And even today. There are a few I still can’t figure out. I have it set up to continually record and I am not using any online streaming programs or the motion detection. I just recently bought 2 more cameras to add to the system. Overall I am really happy with it. Can’t beat the price anywhere.There were some reviews that I read before I bought it that made me think it’s not any good but I still went with it. People complaining about it rebooting all the time just never found the setting to disable auto reboot maintenance. You can also back up important videos with a flash drive, you don’t need the internet plugged in at all. You can also update via the usb with a flash drive. And if you do buy this system or any other system, don’t forget that you need to regularly clean the cameras lens to keep your picture quality good. I clean min about twice a month unless we get a lot of rainfall and or dusty windy weeks. I have already recommended this system to two of my friends.After about a month I started having issues with the dvr. The hard drive started showing errors and wasn’t recording. The playback was freezing and everything was running sluggish. I got ahold of Hiseeu and got helped right away. They said my dvr probably had a defected board. They quickly sent out another dvr and even gave me a free upgrade to 8ch dvr. The hard drive got formatted on my pc and I put it right in. Works so well I think I will have to order a few more cameras. Hiseeu’s customer service was amazing. Talked to them about my issues on Thursday and I had my replacement on Saturday.","Initially I wasn't expecting very much from this product based on the price.However, after using it for a while I found this product to be of excellent quality. It met and exceeded my expectations and had many features and abilities. I was not expecting.I had it for a short while and then I experienced a problem with the hard drive. I contacted the vendor and they responded with courtesy and in a very timely manner. They sent me a new hard drive and installed and have been using and enjoying this product very much. It is a very good product for the money. Based on my experience with this vendor I would have to say that it is a very high quality company. I think you should know that.",i love how the performance of this product exceeded beyond my highest expectstions. it is as said in the description your get more value fir your money. And not only thwt you will get too of the line customer service stress free no bs customer service and its stress freee they will replace defective item guaranteed .,"This system is awesome! No, its not the top of the line, but for your money, you are getting a great value because this system is comparable to the best. No, its not 1080P, but the description states 1080N. Still, a very crisp video. Bottom line, I know I got a great DVR and cameras for my money. Oh, did I mention their fantastic customer care and service? They contacted me and wanted to make sure I was pleased with my purchase.",I found it easy to set up and install. There was a video i mean a lot of videos explaining how to install if you have any doubt on what to do. Many options and sensitivity settings for up to 8 cameras. Night visions works great also. Wires were long enough to hide from front of house to back where my cable tv enters the house. The other 3 cameras were closer so i didn't need to purchase the 100ft extension. I had to make the hole bigger of course since the connectors were pretty large ( my only complaint ). Only took a few couple hours to install since i took my time hiding the wires and attaching the cameras. It helps to have a staple gun for holiday lights for the wires. The app you can download to view the cameras on my phone works a lot better than i expected.,496,171,https://www.amazon.com/Hiseeu-Security-Surveillance-Waterproof-Detection/dp/B07D3SYFKH/ref=sxin_13_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?cv_ct_cx=xfinity+security+cameras&keywords=xfinity+security+cameras&pd_rd_i=B07D3SYFKH&pd_rd_r=f90d8608-12fc-4b9a-b035-2988a031a21d&pd_rd_w=w9xoN&pd_rd_wg=U8HnU&pf_rd_p=4ad71b32-b810-4124-8735-d02a39478d0c&pf_rd_r=0N86H7EYTB065TD95MDS&qid=1640229643&sr=1-2-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVlU4R0RGSFM5SkYzJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTEyMDMyMlpQMlhJWko2RjU5MiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNDczNTI4RkUzRVhZNzc0SktXJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3Bfc2VhcmNoX3RoZW1hdGljJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

Not an exact price, but a price range. After that, I decided to see what were the most common options to the devices in that range.There were about as many wireless as there were wired and I didn't really have a preference on that. I did prefer 4k, but with wanting movable cameras also, that just wasn't financially feasible.So this is the system I ended up with! Having the monitor as part of the NVR was one of the biggest selling points of this system, as well as being able to add more storage capacity later on if I needed it was great too.Setup was about what I expected and was pretty straightforward and simple. The hardest part of the whole setup was actually running power out to the cameras. It was at that point I was wondering if I might as well had gotten a POE camera setup as I'd be doing almost as much work! But then I remembered I'd also have to tie those ethernet cables all the way back to the switch so I quickly put that thought out of my mind and got back to the install.Now when it comes to connecting the cameras to the NVR , your experience could vary quite differently than my own, and even a lot between one camera to the next, as signal strength and quality varies from home to home and router to router (or really wireless access point to wireless access point) so do yourself a favor first and see of you will be operating on 2.5GHz or 5GHz (2.5GHz has better range, but 5GHz has higher speeds and better throughput so keep that in mind) and download a WiFi scanning tool (sorry iPhone users, last text I checked you couldn't even do this on your platform) and see what the signal quality of your network is like where you want to mount each of your cameras. While you're at it, also look at a channel graph of whichever frequency you've decided to use and see if there are any other networks nearby that are using the same channel as you are. If there is and there are also some free channels (or even another populated channel that has a much lower signal stregth) then you should definitely change the channel of your WiFi network as this will help prevent any issues you may get with network interference.After getting my system all setup (I'm on using 2 cameras for now) I'm just letting them run for a few weeks unless I need to access then before then, and then pull up random dates and times within that time span to see how the cameras cope with various weather, visibility conditions, moisture, temperature and biggest of all- night and day!I don't want to give my overall opinion as of yet until I've been able to use it for a while longer, so I will give an update once I've done the above and have hopefully reached some sort of conclusion.I'll also try to download some footage off of the NVR and upload them to this review so you can have some idea of what the footage will look like.","After almost a month I can honestly say this system is amazing! I have one camera installed outside each door and the rest inside and both day and night vision for both areas are great. They just plug in and go, which is what I needed in my older wired house. The harddrive stores a fair amount on it and the app to access remotely works just fine with my S8+. Everything recognized each other without any problem and mounting was as easy as 2 screws per mount. Seriously, I expected a lot less from a low-mid range price slot, but this was perfect for me!!","I love this security system! It was so easy to set up, the range of the cameras greatly surpassed my expectation, and the technical support and customer service are great.I love the fact that it is so easy to set up. Plug the cameras in, and the system recognizes and syncs. I wanted motion activated recording on two cameras - it was so intuitive to find the option and select the cameras I wanted with the option, and it works great.Night vision performance - awesome! Daytime performance - awesome! Camera range is excellent.The question I had (how to set the time when there's not network) was answered a few hours later. It comes with everything you need (100% plug and play). The HHD in mine was a name brand, and with plenty of capacity for the amount of time we're away.I can't find anything I don't like.",I installed my first Anran 4CH camera security remotely at the camp ground and it works flawlessly. It automatically alerts me on my phone and tablet of any activity around the camper. It is such a relief to continuously monitor our property and camper at the lake during summer and winter. It was so easy to install and use that we bought this Anran Expandable 8CH and Audio Recording Wireless Security Camera System with 1TB Hard Drive for our home. The additional optional cameras eliminates any blind areas on the property as well as notifying us of visitors in our driveway. Highly recommend these security systems,"This Anran Security Camera was not only easy to setup but works flawlessly and the camera can move by using my app on my phone!I previously bought a Hiseeu [8CH Expandable, 2K] All in one with 12"" LCD Monitor but had to return it because it interfered with my Ring Doorbell and I received blank images while the Hiseeu camera was on.

JUST WOW,"I'm really happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend this system!The system comes with everything you need. There are four cameras, the DVR unit (I got the one with built-in storage), and all the cables and power cords. And there are some cool extras, like a USB mouse and a remote to navigate the DVR.Set up took about 2 hours to complete. It's really not difficult to do, it's just a matter of setting up the cameras and running the camera cables to the DVR unit. We used the screws that come with the cameras to install them and drilled a hole to run the cables into the house. There is plenty of cable length so you're not limited regarding where you setup the cameras. The cameras have a single cord that does video and power.The cameras look really sturdy and reliable. They come with a base with three holes for the screws. You can adjust the angle and tilt by loosening some screws in the neck of the camera. They are noticeable because of their size, but I think you could hide them with some type of housing. We wanted something that would work as a deterrent so I like that they are noticeable for someone who approaches the house. The size of the field of view of the cameras is another feature I really liked. One camera easily covers our entire driveway.The quality of the image is excellent even in night vision mode, it's better than what I was expecting for the price. It's really a plug-and-play setup, once the cameras are connected to the DVR the system is up and running. The DVR comes with a lot of features, I haven't explored everything yet. The DVR is pretty intuitive to navigate, and there are a ton of useful features that weren't even mentioned on the product page on Amazon (you can create a schedule to have the cameras record at specific times, or use a motion detect mode with an alarm).I highly recommend this system because of the image quality, the value, the DVR that lets you customize how the system runs, and the fairly easy installation.The one thing I think could be improved is the power cord for the DVR that is kind of short. It's a really minor drawback because it works fine with an extension.Note to the seller:I ordered the system because of the price and kind of felt like I was taking a chance with it. The product page needs a few improvements to better reflect what the system can do!There are a few things that would have helped me decide on the system when I was researching my options: some footage that shows what the cameras record to better show the quality, more information about what the DVR menu looks like and all the features built into the DVR, and the exact length of the camera cables.In the end, I'm glad I chose this system! I don't think I could have gotten a better value for the price. I really wanted something that was reliable and easy to use and I feel like that's exactly what we got :)","Well, I'm really impressed with the clarity of the images, it looks good days and nights. the manual needs more details and better information.update.... after a few days using the cctv system 5mp cameras. I posted two pictures, so you can make your own. conclusions. it looks really good.","I don’t usually write reviews but when I make purchases I look at other reviews to help me to decide if I want to purchase that item. So I felt the need to leave a review about this one because it is exactly as described! My husband wanted the cameras, I did not. Let me just say I love having them and I’m glad my husband wanted them! They are simple to install, have clean and crisp video I mean the picture is just awesome. The night vision is awesome too, I was really impressed by how much I could see when it is pitch black out! I’m still learning how to use the system but it’s not to bad once you start getting it. My friend has a system and let me just say he was impressed and said it was better than the one he has! So yes I would highly recommend!","Excellent product, this is my second purchase with this seller. Great person to interact with for help, very prompt. Highly recommend this seller and I would definitely buy from again!","First of all the night Vision is amazing. ITs better then the cameras I have in my restaurant.

The installation was easy, no need for me to do cable management, just drill a couple holes, then screw these things in and wala, they work. Make sure you put it in a place with a good amount of sunlight though (find that place and determining where to put stuff took the longest). The camera quality is pretty great, the night vision, and motion sensing is pretty good too. Overall, pretty amazing product. Connection to the device to my phone was also pretty easy.","I absolutely love that this has a solar panel to charge the battery and have noticed that it charges pretty well even on darker, overcast days. Installation was straightforward and easy enough. Connection and set up weren't too complicated, even for someone tech challenged like me which was really nice. I'm really happy with how the camera performs too, the motion detection setting is really nice, I can customize exactly how sensitive I want it to be. The picture quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, I was actually really surprised and impressed with how good it shows up at night","Ezetai has created a modernistic-looking, lithium battery-powered, full HD surveillance camera for indoor usage. I enjoy the satisfaction of being able to monitor a certain space. It’s equipped with WiFi and motion detection, and allows for remote access from my smartphone! The camera works just as good as it looks, and it looks great!","I love having solar charged technology. This picture is at night time and is pretty darn clear and crisp.

Easy to Install!,A much improved camera.,"No DDNS option, but great customer support","Incredible Value, 5 STARS!",Update: Disappointing!☹️,"I have plenty of IP cameras in my house. They are a combination of DLink, Wansview, Tenvis etc. I have to say my most durable ones are from Wansview. I've had some for as long as 2010! They simply give you the best bang for your buck. I hate to say it but the reason ALL of these IP cameras have a low rating is because of one thing. User error. I admit, I have an IT background and installing these are really easy for me. The new cloud feature couldn't be more easier to install. Even my mom could do it, (sorry mom LOL). Just download the app, make an account, show the QR code that shows up on your app to the camera. Super easy.This new Q5 is my favorite along with my other Wansview cam (top photo). It is very compact (see bottom right photo). It also has a microUSB port for power (left pic). I hope this review has helped you.","My review is based on the experience of using several IP cameras from different vendors over the past 4 years.Overall, the Wansview Q5 Cloud Camera performs very well and the initial setup / install is super easy and quick. With some of my other cameras, I sometimes spent hours (even days) in setting them up. I like the Q5 new form-factor which is nicer and much smaller than the previous Q3 camera. It feels well-built and I expect it to last for many years. The phone software can use some bells and whistles available from other competing IP cameras. That said, it is very intuitive and easy-to-use. In summary, I would recommend this camera because of its well-built hardware, functionalities, and price. Below are some more details:Pros:+ Setting up the first time is quick (5 min for both software and hardware) with their easy-to-follow instructions.+ Camera hardware is well-built, good-looking, and small in size which I like.+ The wide-angle lens is the best I’ve seen in terms of clarity and coverage.+ Crisp & clear images and videos - day and night (see images attached).+ Excellent audio & mic (considering the small-size factor), definitely better than that on their Q3 and K3 cameras, and other cameras I’ve owned.+ The Wansview cloud android phone app is easy to set up, easy to use and to configure.+ Upon detecting motions, the camera sends me alerts on my phone, and 10-sec video clips in the mobile app. This a new feature. Nicely done Wansview!Cons:- No audio-detection alert capability (only motion-detection).- Viewing saved images, they don’t auto-rotate along with the phone’s rotating to a horizontal orientation (from a vertical orientation)- It would be nice if the phone app’s white background can be manually set to a darker theme like black.- It would be nice if the multi-camera screen can be set to load as default upon logging in. Currently it requires an extra click.","Gave this camera to my dad. Here is his review:""Just got this new Q5 IPCam to add to my other Wansview IPCameras. First thing I noticed was the ease of setup.A couple of items to note:- Setup and operation are ONLY with WiFi. Plugged in LAN is not an option.- Your phone and Q5 will have to be in same 2.4GHz connection frequency. Q5 will only connect to 2.4GHz and your phone may be on a 5GHz spectrum, not gonna work. If your home WiFi shows two separate SSID’s for each frequency then it should be easy enough for you. I’ve setup my WiFi router to use one SSID only for both frequencies, I had to go into my router setup and temporarily disable the 5GHz radio to force all devices I have to the lower frequency. I turned the 5GHz radio once the Q5 was completely setup.- Like the fact they’re finally using micro USB connector from DC supply to IPCam and not the old 3.5mm plug in type- The Q5 will not work with the previous Wansview IPCam App but instead you’ll need to download their new Wansview Cloud App which is fine as well.- Image sample looking from my home office window is not that bad. I’m sure I can clean it up some more later.- No DDNS support. Camera will only work using Wansview Cloud App. I use a third party IPCam viewer App to use on all my other IPCameras (Foscam, Amcrest and Wansview), no luck on this one or at least not yet. Hopefully they will upgrade it for future capability.- The new Wansview Cloud App still need some work to refine minor UI issues particularly on the chat section.- I’m not a big fan of IPCam paid cloud subscription regardless who the service provider is. I’ll continue using the memory card option on this camera. I could save all recording to my own cloud system if only DDNS is supported on these Q5 IPCamTechnical support either email or chat using the chat option on the App (even on Wechat!) was amazing. These guys are extremely helpful, particularly Simona!Will definitely order more again from them if only they can help on the DDNS option. Otherwise their customer support team’s ability is what pushed them to 5 stars.""",,"I like it! I don’t bother with the ‘Cloud Storage’ and just use the short videos! I turn the notifications off because there are too many with me moving around back and forth all the time. But I find it handy to check on my Cat while I’m out, and when I’m out of town I’ll turn the notifications back on while he’s at the pet sitters. Works for me!👍********************************************UPDATE: TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED!After a VERY short time, I discovered this camera obviously doesn’t work! I had a delivery person walk thru my home right in front of the camera, being in the kitchen talking for over a minute and walking back thru. It NEVER showed ANY motion at all!!! WOW! And here I thought I was going to have some security in this low income housing district I live in!

Safe With Encrypted Channels,Super clear cameras,Great cameras all around!,Amazed by these cameras.,Easy setup and great video quality! Simple App!,I am so happy I found this product! I was skeptical about cameras connecting to my home due to hearing of problems relating to other brands and hackers. This camera connects to a safe and encrypted server every time you log in to view your cameras so I am always able to feel at ease! These cameras are wonderful and the price you are paying makes them even BETTER! They have great quality and set up takes no longer than 5 minutes! Upon receiving the cameras (in a timely manner I might add) they were nicely packaged with an instruction manual that made set up easy and quick. The longest set up time was finding where I was going to put them! The adhesive 3m tape worked great as I stuck it to the side of a wall and I haven’t had any problems. The app is the third one down in the App Store (I have pictured the correct one for reference). As you can see in the live shot I included the image is clear and the two way sound works wonderful. I love being able to check in on my dogs all day when at work and being able to speak to them through the camera makes things ten times better! Definitely recommend this product!,"Pros: the picture quality on these is wonderful. I can see everything so clearly, even with the night vision. The microphone works well too. It’s 2-way. The instructions were simple and very clear. I love that this comes with both the micro SD card option and the cloud upload option for recordings.Cons: completely user/reader error... I didn’t read the product description very carefully and thought these were outdoor cameras. They are not. I also thought that “wireless” meant cordless. Not the case. These have to be plugged in to work. Both were not a deal breaker. I found a great use for them indoors and they were easy to install with the plug attached.If you are looking for an inexpensive way to feel secure, check in on animals or have a baby monitor, these are definitely the way to go.","If you're looking for something super simple and affordable for piece of mind this is it. I'm honestly impressed with the image quality for the price. Night vision is pretty amazing. Picture shown of my room is dark but not pitch black, outside pic is pitch black. Alerts work well, annoyingly well, but you can adjust sensitivity or set a schedule etc. Love the fact it comes with two 32gb memory cards so you're ready to go out of the box. Set up was very simple. Literally download the app, plug in camera, pick up camera and scan a barcode that pops up on your phone to sync and you are viewing live. Playback is my only gripe because just the smallest slide will fast forward or rewind by a few minutes. Hard to pin point exact times, not impossible. Might be better to have it just record on movement detection but i just keep it on full time. Speakers work very well, can talk to my dog while he's on my bed. This was a deal breaker lmao. You can also hear from the mic in the camera so you can use as a baby monitor or hear your wife's boyfriend. I know these are indoor but I put one against a window and it worked perfect for daytime but at night there was nothing but glare from the ir light. I just decided to say screw it and mount it outside under the car-port where things don't really get weather damaged. Seems absolutely fine this morning: no dew in the lens or anything and I added pics just to show. Will update review if I totally screwed up but with the price I doubt I'll get too mad either way.Edit: about a week outside under the carport and no noticeable difference or damage whatsoever. Working perfect.. Would not put it somewhere it can get rained on for sure. Will update again after a whileNew pic added at midnight still going strong outside. Keep both cameras on event recording and playback is sooo much better.5 month update! New picture added with timestamp for proof. Outside camera still going strong. Noticed recently it was going offline occasionally and figured out it was the power cord going bad from the weight of the extension cord pulling down on it. Micro usb are used for everything so really not an issue, most people have a thousand of them these days. Bedroom camera still great because theres no pressure on that cord.. Other than that literally no problems other than the occasional alert from curious critters :)",I own 2 Wyze cams and several eufy cams and I like them both but the quality picture on these cameras tops them both. The pictures on these cameras top the Wyze cams and match or maybe exceed the Eufy for quality. Ery pleasantly surprised these cameras.Highly recommend.,"These are great cameras for the money, the setup was super simple, and the app is easy to use and doesn’t glitch out or anything.

I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't. None. Not a single thing.It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways. I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed. Nope.I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house. Nope. There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not. They are not location aware in any way. The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording. Nope!The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours. Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room. I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on. This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%. This is with all the 'battery saving options' on. This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording. So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing. I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality. The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.***UPDATE***Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera. You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then. Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't. Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera. The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support. Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.***ANOTHER UPDATE***From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"". This will be a great update and should have been available on launch. I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.***ONE MORE UPDATE***Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days. It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration. With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set. They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away. For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off. You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc. Or any combination. The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can. This is a great improvement. They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5. This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras. I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.***LAST UPDATE***Having the modes features and my cameras set to only pop on and record during an alarm event (which is rare) and be off at all other times, I've had 2 months to evaluate battery life, almost exactly 60 days now. All my cameras were down to below 10% battery level when I checked them last night. Given the rate of battery drain I had expected them to last 3 months - though 2+ still isn't bad. I have two external cameras on my entry gates outside with the solar panel add-on, they stay fully charged at all times even though it's pretty much been non-stop dark and cloudy days here since installation. They are set to record all motion and since they point at a street they record events dozens of times per day... so if you're thinking of getting the solar panels for outdoor use, I highly recommend them.","Before I start my revised review, let me state that there's been a lot of news lately about people hacking into Ring cameras, but this only happens when someone installs a new camera and doesn't update the default username and password (or has an extremely weak password which is easy for a hacker to guess). This is like leaving your front door open while on vacation. Your camera is sending and receiving signals over a wireless network. Anyone within range of the signal can potentially be a threat if you don't have good encryption (username and good password) set up on your camera. There's no logical reason for a Ring owner to not do this. Ring even stresses changing the default settings during the initial setup process. Bottom line, don't blame the car manufacturer if you leave the keys in your car and it gets stolen.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions.Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product.Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all.Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement.A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring.Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised.***UPDATE***Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices.Ring has now updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new wireless battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well.Observations.Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool.I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a few months before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent.I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once.Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete.I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic.Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.","Had the camera up and running in less than ten minutes. Excellent quality picture. Hooking up to the solar panel when installing, this way battery is always charged. Received mounting hardware, camera has been installed.",Installed 2 of these outside my house in about 20 minutes. Mounted one above my garage and the other near my front door. The video quality is pretty good. Not facial recognition software good but good enough for a good description of people if needed. I used the mounts that came will the camera and scanned the QR code for setup. Not sure why people couldn't set up zones. It is part of the setup unless you skip over the steps. I do agree with most reviews that the notifications are spotty. Took my trash out and the one by the garage only recorded me going to the side of the house and the one by the front door only recorded me coming back. A neighbor walked by this morning and it started recording after they walked by and were down the street. Pic attached. Went outside again and the both cameras picked me up as I would have expected. I will adjust the camera and reset the zones to see if that helps. They are my first Ring cameras so there may be fine tuning on my part that is needed. Will update this as the days go by.Windows 10 app logs me in but says I don't have any cameras set up. Tried on a PC and 2 laptops. Please fix!!Phone apps are pretty good so far. (Samsung note 9)Updating to 5 Stars.....After adjusting my zones and motion settings I was able to get the results I needed. At one point the wind blew leaves across my driveway and my sensor went off. After fine tuning I see no issues with the camera and its performance. It is by far better than other cameras I have purchase over the years and after comparing subscriptions from other companies $10 a month or $100 is a deal.,Don’t let any negative reviews influence your decision to buy these cameras. The negative reviews are from people who have not read the instructions or just have no idea how a security camera works. I monitor 16 security cameras where I work so I have a lot of experience with them. I bought the Ring Stick up camera and the solar charger for it as well. They both work great. I bought two more a week later. Now a month later I have no issues with battery power loss of any kind. Just set your zones to cover what you want. Don’t put motion sensor on full or you will catch bugs and falling leaves. I set my sensitivity in the middle. The image quality day and night is pretty good. You can also look at your cameras from a computer as well as your phone. You don’t need an Alexa to use these. The microphone works well too. Overall I would highly recommend these if you just read and understand the instructions and how they work which is very simple and easy.MD in SC 1-1-21,35984,1,https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Stick-Up-Cam-Battery-HD-security-camera-with-two-way-talk-Works-with-Alexa-/dp/B07Q6ZZFLS/ref=sr_1_35?keywords=xfinity+security+cameras&qid=1640229651&sr=8-35

Everything came as it should and it took me a day to mount and wire up all the camera's. It took me another few hours just to get all the angles right and to move one to different location. Once I had it up and running it took me only a little bit to figure out how to get it running and recording. The main unit is about a 12"" x 12"" and everything hooks up nice. It comes with a 1Terabite drive and was easy to get formatted and recording. One thing I would say to all, is let it keep the default image resolution settings. If you try to go higher than the camera's will handle, it will cause it to reboot and start all over. I hooked this up to a older TV with the HDMI connection and it stays on at all times right above my computer desk.My real worry was the quality of the camera's. Truthfully I don't think they are 720p camera's myself. If you try to make the image large the image is a bit blurry and unstable. Not the kind of unstable that would make it not be usable but if you have watched a 720p video it's a lot better than this. But that aside, the quality is much better than the older style systems you used to get, and for the money it's worth it. The biggest plus to this system is the night vision. This to me is where this system really shines. The camera goes Black and White when it gets too dark and the images are not awesome, but better than anything I have seen on any of my work systems. They really do show about 65 feet in the pitch dark and though it is a bit grainy you can still make out anything moving out there. I can even see my dog when he goes out to do his thing : pThe peace of mind from having this system is worth every penny. We had some prowlers before we got this messing with our water lines and this is why we purchased this unit. If they ever come back, their gonna get a nice ride and three meals and a cot.Also just a helping hint. The joints to the camera's are sturdy, but if you try to tighten the locking clamp by twisting the camera body you will break the joint. So don't be tempted. Get a pair of Channel Locks and hold the camera and then tighten the lock ring, not super tight but snug. You can thank me later : )","I ordered this system. It arrived super fast and communication with the vendor has been excellent. My plan was to power up the system on the kitchen table and let it run for 4 or 5 days to become familiar with it and verify that it works. I figured being Amazon I could send it back if it didn't live up to expectations. So far, so good.I have been running this system in one configuration or another for more than two months now and have not regretted the purchase. The quality and software capabilities far exceed my expectations at this price point. My only complaint on it so far is the remote app for android. My problems with it are outlined below. Since I am not that interested in remote viewing this is not an issue for me.I have NOT been given a discount for this equipment as some reviewers so the comments below are strictly my own.1-4-17Received the system and wired everything except WIFI and video out. Everything worked well on initial power up. Easy setup with the Wizard. Good clear image for each camera. As night approached and the lights turned off I checked night vision. I don't know what it will do for long distance but in the house in total darkness, 15 feet away I could easily see a person move and what they were wearing. I could not make out details of the face.1-5-17I let system run all night and recording worked fine. Today I opened the DVR to see how it was built.The hard drive is a Toshiba 1 TB 6 GB/s SATA drive. My plan is to install a larger drive so that when we are on vacation we can have two weeks of saved video. I can then use this drive as a backup drive in my server.There is a small cooling fan on the left as you are looking at the front of the unit. There is a good size heat sink on the main chip. I plan to install the DVR on its side so the fan should be up with space on bottom ( right side of unit ) to assure air flow.There are three USB connectors. One on the front of the DVR and two on the back. A mouse comes with the system. I tested it with a wireless mouse but it would not work because you couldn't load a driver for it. The two other USB ports can be used for a backup drive and a wireless dongle.There is also an RJ45 LAN port on the back. I plugged a Cisco bridge into it to connect to my wireless LAN. Entered the password and connected with no issues. I ended up running an Ethernet cable from the RJ45 port to my router. I had some issues getting the remote access app to work with wireless. Not sure if that was the reason.Also a BNC video out connector. Not tested yet but my plan is to run this to my video distribution system so that I can view the cameras on any TV in the house.I had an issue with one of the indoor cameras. I moved the camera on its gimbal mount too far and some of the silicone tubes popped out. My error for moving it so much. I attempted to put them back but they would not stay in place and there was no way to get a dab of glue in there. Then I read the camera instructions ( yes, I should have done that first ) and learned that you can disassemble the camera to mount it to the ceiling. Now I can re glue the silicone pieces. One helpful point is that the instructions say to unscrew the bottom part of the mount. I grabbed the two pieces to unscrew and they would not budge. The trick I learned was hold the two parts very gently and wiggle them in a counterclockwise motion.1-7-17I set a fixed IP address on the DVR and when I go to the browser on my computer on the LAN and type in that IP address I can view the cameras and change any of the settings. This means I won't need a monitor or mouse connected to the DVR and it can be better hidden. It doesn't do you much good to DVR the bad guys and then have them steal the DVR.Installed the app SECU365 as recommended by Zosi. My Norton AV said there was no risk. After it installed it appeared to install something else and all of a sudden Norton said it sent data back to China and was a privacy issue. Considering that this is a view into my home I'm very concerned about anyone hacking into this. It may be safer to forego the remote view. If anyone has info on a different app that is known to be safer please leave a comment.Also a note on the silicone bumpers on the indoor cameras. After regluing they fell out again while installing on ceiling. The camera still held in the position I set it so it wasn't a big deal. Just annoying. I plan to replace the silicone tubes with something different on the next camera I install.3-2-17We have had some milder winter weather in our area so I was able to get all the wiring run in the attic and the outdoor cameras installed. I had a minor problem with one of the outdoor cameras and the vendor responded quickly and took care of the problem. I have been very happy with the quick response on any issue from the seller!With all 8 cameras running full time but not recording any audio I am able to record a few hours less than 2 weeks of video. I have not done much with learning to use the motion detection or the time out for the cameras feature. I would guess that I will get more than 2 weeks of video by only recording motion. I will write more on this topic later when I have more time.One thing I learned was that you can only save video clips out through the front panel USB port. I should have learned this before I installed the system because I had to use a 90 degree USB adaptor and a short cable to access the port.As mentioned before I can view live video, review recorded video, copy recorded video to the front panel USB and change any of the configuration settings from my Win7 browser. I wish there was a way to copy a portion of a recording to my local Win7 drive through the browser. I am planning to write to support if a firmware update would allow to do this or any other features. I will write more on this at a later time.",,"It is lowest cost for such a security system even buying the hard drive separate, and I put a 2TB hard drive and only used 2 of the 4 cameras so I got two more for spares.The instructions are lacking so it takes a little (just a little) ingenuity to figure out things like the red light is power and the green light means the videos are activated and working, and ""play back"" only means play back while we have to go to the main menu and click ""backup"" in order to copy a file onto a flash-drive. The red icon means no sound but this DVR can install a microphone if our State does not object. The small yellow lighted icon is for the motion detector coming on, but even with motion detection the videos are recording 24 hours every day constantly so it gives full coverage.The infrared comes out black-n-white but it is brilliant how it lights up the entire yard like a strobe light and yet completely invisible to our human eyes, except for the little red glow of the infrared around the face of the camera.I attached mine to one of my HDMI's on my TV so to watch a live view outside then I just change from TV over to the HDMI and there it is constantly live monitoring but when I turn away from that HDMI then the TV does not show the video so it harms nothing.I mounted one camera inside but I do not want inside on full time monitoring so I put the power wire hanging loose and so if I ever want the camera inside to start working then I just reach down and push together the loose power cord and then the inside camera comes on only at my comand.I am very happy with this.","Picture quality is great, use of the DVR is pretty straight-forward, and overall I'm very happy with these (especially for the price! I just could not ding a star for two minor issues (below) given the price of this system).Hooked up the app to my phone and now I can see the house while away.Customer service is spot on. I had a hiccup of my own doing and they were quick to respond via email to get me sorted. I sent pictures of my issues, they sent answers. Got me running fast!Setup: mostly easy except the camera assembly has swivel issues. There are two screws that keep the barrel in place that prevent it from easily fine-tuning the angle of the picture after install (see picture). But, loosen those screws and turn the barrel, tighten again, and it does work; it's just not easy at the top of a ladder.Cables: the cable lengths were great - got everywhere I needed them with ease. But, the cable connectors are different lengths (see picture). A bit OCD sure, but try to put them in electrical tape or outdoor tape and you have a lump.Grab a 2TB Storage Drive, also on Amazon, and this is a perfect system for install and walk away.https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IMPO5MO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1Again, for the price, you can't beat this.

Given the affordable price, I considered this system to be entry level, but likely good enough for surveilling my home. I was right; I’ve had it installed for a few weeks now and I am satisfied with it.I did not want a wifi camera system so I bought this hard-wired system. Wires are more reliable and I don’t need 8 or 9 more devices on my wifi router. I bench-tested every camera and wire before permanently installing anything. The cameras work well. The resolution is good but since the lens has a very wide angle, the corners of the image are less sharp than the center. But this is acceptable to me because the wide lens covers a lot of area.The BNC cables work acceptably, but I found that 65 feet was not long enough. To get to the four corners of my home’s exterior (3200 sq ft), I needed to purchase some other-brand 100-ft and 150-ft cables. I found that both the Zosi and the aftermarket cables are susceptible to visible feedback in the images, especially when the wires are bent near the connectors. I got them all to work acceptably, but you get what you pay for.The DVR I initially received was easy to set up and worked well, except that it would reboot itself every couple of hours. Zosi customer service helped me address it and eventually shipped me a new DVR unit at no cost. This has solved the problem. They are helpful and responsive, but they are located in China so emails generally have a 1-day turnaround time. Reviewing recorded footage works but it is not intuitive. There are a lot of unmarked icons to figure out. But it works.The app works but it is a little clunky. Each time I open it when away from the home wifi, I have to tell it to connect to the cameras. At first the app couldn’t see the cameras away from home. Zosi had to help me tweak settings on the DVR and my router (like disabling the firewall!) to get it to work. It does work reliably now. Again, you get what you pay for.There is also a desktop application for viewing the cameras, but you can only load it via the supplied mini-CD (what is this, 1999?) and it only shows the footage in low resolution. But it works.Overall, for the price I am happy with this system. I can view my house at home live on my TV, away from home on my phone, or later via playback. A high-end professional system would have cost several thousand dollars. This system meets my needs and could be used by any homeowner or small business.","The I purchased this system, was someone broke into my son's new/used car 2 weeks after he bought it, stealing over $500 in electronics; GPS, Radar Detector, and Dash Camera, add in the cost to replace the broken window, and it's a no brainier to figure out I need a camera DVR.First off the instructions to place the DVR on the Internet are nonexistent, however, a duckduckgo.com search will return more then enought help for you. The short answer is you have to open port (37777) on your firewall to allow the DVR to be seen via your cellphone or remote PC. The DVR presets allow for recording out of the box, and its internet settings are set to DHCP by default, so networking is pretty simple, its dealing with your Cable Modem or DSL modem that's hard; more on that later.The camera's have a nice clean, clear picture, and during low light automatically turn on the IR LEDs and the camera switches to Black and White mode; there isn't anyway to see other then B/W using IR illumination, that's just the way the world is. If you try and use a camera at night pointing outside through a window, the IR LEDs will cause the window to act like a mirror and you won't see anything.The cables that come with the unit are 18.3 meters or 60 feet for the rest of us in the free world. They sell additional cables at a very inexpensive price, so there's no need to make your own. The ends on the cables prevent you from plugging into the cameras wrong, so even with the addition of extra cables it's a simple installation; you will have to buy some female to female BNC barrels to use with the extensions.There's a selection under ""Networking"" that is labeled ""WiFi"", however, it only works with a WiFi USB adapter sold buy some other vendor. There's 2 USB ports on the back of the DVR, the top port is marked ""USB 2.0"", I assume for a thumb drive for backing up recorded data, and the bottom is is labeled ""USB Mouse"", which was included; the optical mouse worked in both ports, so I'm thinking the DVR doesn't support a Keyboard. There is very little need for a keyboard since all the information to be entered is easily accomplished via a mouse and the only time I wanted a keyboard was to enter in the password.There's a setting for allowing the DVR to obtain time off the internet using NTP, however, I still had to manually set the time the very first time, there's support for DST, however, you have to tell the DVR which days to start and stop DST.Power for the DVR comes from a small wall wart, however, there are terminal connections to allow for the use of 2 wires to supply power, the cameras are supplied from a separate power supply, one power supply can support 8 cameras, and an octopus cable is supplied for this.Another nice design feature ZOSI did, was adding a slot in the side of the bottom bracket of the camera. The slot is to allow the cables to be run outside of the mounting plate in the case you're not able to drill a hole behind the mounting plate. If you do drill a hole behind the mounting plate, all your wires will be hidden from view and you'll have a very clean installation.I used the HDMI connection to connect to my TV for use as a display, there's also a VGA port that could be used, however, at the cost of HDMI TV's it's probably the connection most users will use. The display allows you to see up to 9 cameras at once realtime, and double clicking on any one picture will expand it to full screen. I only own a 740p TV, however the cameras output 1080p to it without any problem.Getting on to the internet : after reading the online documentation for getting the DVR to be seen from a device on the internet I found that I had to add a Port Forwarding rule to allow port 37777 to the DVR. This will require you to hard code an IP address into the DVR, which is very easy, its figuring out how to add the Port Forwarding to your DSL/Cable modem that may give you problems. If your modem supports adding a DMZ, you could also add the DVR to the DMZ and not bother with Port Forwarding. Each modem is different so once again duckduckgo.com may be need to find help on this. You'll need to remember to turn WiFi off on your cellphone when trying to test the remote viewing application, since when your cellphone is on the same network as the DVR the firewall rules don't apply.The Android ZOSI viewing application isn't as easy to navigate as I'd expect, I don't own an iPhone so I can't speak to that application. One thing I DID NOT like about the ZOSI's Android application, is it requires you to give it an unreasonable amount of access to your phone's resources; why do they need access to your camera, contacts, and a host of other items? ZOSI, fix this, or at least explain why you need all of this access. The remote display is downgraded to prevent over use of your network data plan on your cell phone, I've played with it a bit, however, I can't say if this is a setting that can be changed. I did figure out that you can remotely capture video from a camera onto your cell phone, and also play back video as well.As I learn more about the system I may post more.I've yet to try and add a WiFi camera to the system, as I still have to install all 8 cameras, but I'll try that next and post the results.","Let me start with saying I went with the 8channel 2T package, and not only is this better than Swann, Blink XT2 and Ring.... But it’s a fraction of the price!! (I’ve never tried any other companies besides those 3) but I was just like you if your reading this comment right now, and it didn’t seem there was enough information in the description or you weren’t sure if this is worth the money because it’s reasonably priced. I personally took 5 minutes of my time to type this specifically for you to know if your in the market for home security or security for you shop or business, then look no further because this is your best bang for you buck. Plug and play system that isn’t complicated, full accessibility to each cameras settings such as color, tint, zoom. When you hook the system up it will automatically be in motion detection mode, so anytime there is movement on any camera the system will save that file to your DVR, or You can change it to record 24hrs-7days a week and depending on what size hard drive you get let’s say that it only holds 1 month of recordings so 30days (each day 24hrs) on the 31st day the dvr will automatically rewrite over day 1 (or the oldest day etc) you can schedule recordings, save recordings and IF YOU HAVE INTERNET at you home you can download the app and be able to see your cameras on your phone, pc, or tablet. Hopefully this helped you decide","We had a Zmodo 8CH HDMI 960H DVR 700TVL Outdoor Indoor Day Night IR-CUT CCTV previously that we purchased in early 2016 and we have since moved and decided to upgrade to newer technology. We had replaced that system with the ZOSI 8 Channel 720P 1080N HD-TVI Security DVR Recorder HD Hybrid Capability 4-in-1 after a lightning strike took out the Zmodo DVR in 2018. The system is very easy to setup and the quality of the product feels better than the previous version as well. The cameras are more sturdy and the quality of the image both day and night are far superior. The motion detection is much better as well. My old unit would have so many different colors on the playback that I didn’t know what was detected. The app integration is much better than the other system as well. All in all, it’s a superior upgrade from the old one.","Bought this HD system to replace an older VGA system. It is a great deal! Everything works as advertised. The camera quality is very good in daylight and nightlight. Video image is very clear even after upconverting on a UHD TV. The wider viewing angle is also very good as two cameras can cover 180 degree compared to the old system that required three cameras. Very happy with this purchase and would recommend this product for those looking for a system at this price point.There was a glitch with the first DVR received as it would alarm a failure once every 4-6 days and would try to restart failing to see the hard drive. It was a problem with the motherboard in the DVR and ZOSI promptly replaced the DVR within a few days. Everything has been working very well since the replacement.Update Nov 2019: Discovered recently that the DVR would crash everytime trying to back up a video file. Contacted Zosi and after a series of trouble shooting efforts with ""Coco"", it was determined that the DVR itself was causing the problem. Coco promptly sent a new replacement DVR and the problem was resolved. Again, great support from Zosi!",815,164,https://www.amazon.com/ZOSI-Security-Recorder-Weatherproof-Surveillance/dp/B00M2P0LQO/ref=sr_1_20?keywords=zosi+security+camera&qid=1640229325&sr=8-20

However, we got very busy, the holidays came upon us, and we didn’t even open the box until the beginning of January of 2020 to start installing these. We began by hooking up a couple of the cameras which was easy, and the instructions were clear. Everything was excellent with the cameras, setup, etc. Great quality, the features on the camera were good, everything was fantastic. Except for one thing… the cameras had a “normal” field of view and we realized we really needed a “wide-angle” field of view. Don’t’ get me wrong, this set of cameras provides a good field of view, but we really need to see a much broader angle for our purposes.We emailed Zosi and explained our situation, even though it had been almost 3 months since our purchase. Their response was nothing short of amazing. They asked us to send some photos of what type of wide-angle we needed, etc. I explained we had not installed the cameras, we had just opened two of them to try them out. They then suggested we purchase a different “wide-angle” system, which was literally only $30 more. They accepted back our return and then shipped out the new system. It was perfect.From the very first time we emailed them asking for help and support, they were in constant communication. They respond to emails within half a day EVERY TIME. This was simply one of the best customer service experiences we have had with an organization. It was absolutely apparent they wanted us to be comfortable and happy with their product, and to make sure it suited our needs.I highly recommend reaching out to Zosi with any questions you might have prior to your purchase. But let me tell you, they have your back. I would purchase their products without hesitation. You’re in good hands with Zosi.",I replaced my 3yr old system with this one after lightning took it out. It is very good quality. Everything came nicely packaged clearly new. Daytime video is awsume compared to my old system. Night vision is very good to. I did my research and decided to buy this system. Glad I did. Bought the WD Purple 1 tb hard disc and installed no problems. Very easy. Used screws from my old system hard drive. Not sure what I've done if didn't have um. Didn't see with new HD or new DVR. Maybe just didn't see them. Don't know. Anyway DVR is quite dispite other reviews of being a noisy fan. This is a good quality system with lots of features. I have not tryed remote view and probably won't so I can't comment on that. For a low cost system it really delivered. With that said.... Your not going to read licence plates in the street especially at night. You'll need to spend thousands for that. I recommend this for low cost piece of mind and as a deturant. I'd be glad to answer any questions. Update: 10 months later still working now.,,The picture is fine I'm trying to figure out how to allow it to record the sound from that Jack on the back and I'm not able to get it to record or play sound for me I tested the microphone it works good I need to open up that audio in input on the back in the menu apparently but I can't find the spot to do it,What I like about the system is it cost the ease of installation and product support\ customer service.What I don't like about the product is that it only recordes 8 channels out of 16 that is something to slip through my cracks and for system that Large it didn't come with a hard drive.,414,60,https://www.amazon.com/ZOSI-Channel-Security-Weatherproof-Surveillance/dp/B079TPJG6J/ref=sr_1_21?keywords=zosi+security+camera&qid=1640229325&sr=8-21

We have a defective HDMI port so they are sending a new DVR!!! Talk about great service!!!! Right now it will stay a 5 star.I’m giving it five stars right now, but we are now having issues with the system. I think we might have gotten a faulty system, but tech-support is working on it. This screen comes up pink and green when we turn on the TV to view the cameras.When we first started it up it was perfect absolutely perfect the cameras were beautiful crystal clear, needed just a little tweaking. But after a couple of days when we turn the TV on to view the cameras the picture is pink and green. Tech-support hopefully is on it and will let us know what’s wrong. I will update as time goes on","The camera system took a little more time to get to me than preferred but overall i am now very happy with my purchase. I’m an electrician that has installed hundreds of cameras over the past 15 years and I can say I’m impressed with the overall quality of the system. The cameras are by no means cheap, they have crystal clear images during day and clear images in night mode. The cameras themselves are durable and easy to install. The dvr works great. The only downside I see to system is that all cables are 100 foot long, as long as you know how to install your own camera wire you will be fine. I give this product overall a 5 star rating",Bought this to replace a 5-year-old system that started to die one piece at a time. This cost less than the old one and is much better quality. The video is clear and the system is easy to use. The instructions can be a bit confusing but take your time and you will get it done. I never needed to call Tech support.,The Customer Service was excellent I spoke with Jeremy and he helped me every step of the way and I am not used to a windows computer and took me a while to figure it out! He was so patient and we made a team and the system is working great the pictures are clear and plenty of cameras! I am very happy with the service especially! Thank you Jeremy!,"This is a very good system. It records 24/7 with motion detection at the same time. The settings takes a little time to get use to though. You will need a 2gb hard drive for every 4 cameras attached to the system. The remote view is very good, it allows you to playback, record, live view, and take a snapshot with zoom capabilities. The customer support is very good too, they answered me (Everytime) I had a question or needed something. That is awesome by itself.

NO adapter needed. Very dark at night.  Daytime is not brght,"Got the cameras today and installed them. Wow, what a difference new cameras make. I'm looking at some teenagers walking by, now. These cameras are in ""night mode"" right now. The best picture I've ever had with cameras! These have LED's also. They are 100% brighter then the ""old school"" lights that I had on my old cameras. I had no problem installing them, but I have installed a few cameras over the years. These are a real upgrade from what I had. I think I will order a couple more and switch out my other cameras as well.You can really tell these are 1080p HD cameras too. I wasn't to sure of this brand, I have always purchased -Sw-nn- brand in the past. These will be my new go to cameras and what ever else I might need to upgrade my system in the future. Also, I might add, that the shipping was super fast too. One of my old cameras was out completely, and one had the night vision out. So, it was nice to receive these quickly. I hope these new cameras hold up as long as my old did. I think they will, though. You can see the quality and how they have improved over the years. I already have a DVR so I didn't need a whole system. I just purchased two cameras and linked them to my existing DVR. They cameras are plug and play with my current system. One last thing. Thank you again for the quality cameras and fast shipping.","I bought one of the dome style and liked it enough to buy two more domes and two bullet style. They record good quality but you need a recorder that can use that quality. You will only get the resolution your recorder can handle.You will probably have to go through the settings to get the best results, especially at night. One problem I had was the IR LEDs reflected off a white surface and completely washed out the video. I was able to paint the surface dark and ended up with excellent video. If you don't get good results at first, play with the settings and look for other problems like light sources and reflective surface. These are good cameras and one of the good things is the ability to make adjustments.","I have Cobra Surveillance System that came with 4 cameras. It also has room for 4 more. The store where I bought it was offering additional cameras @ $40 each. Instead I ordered two of these and bought two hundred foot cables also. Total bill $35 as opposed to $80. Cameras picture is a bit better than the original cams as well. Winner, winner.","The cameras are well made and good quality. Make sure they work with your DVR before you order ( I didn’t and had to replace them) Zosi customer support realy rocks, special thanks to Emma, she went extra mile in making sure the cameras will work with my DVR and arranging replacement shipment immediately.Overall great product and support - will buy again and recommend to anyone!","I liked the fact that the wires were what I needed.

Works as advertised,I'm impressed with this System.  However one camera seems to be weak.,Tech support,"Excellent Customer Support is the first thing, very good camera system is the second.",Its precisely what you pay for its functional for a mid-range camera system,"I bought the 4 channel with the 1 TB HDD. I'm the IT guy at a manufacturing facility and this was purchased to monitor our shipping system. Something simple, well designed, afordable and reliable that could monitor our shipping conveyors, gates, doors and boxes, etc. I purchased it in April of 2016 with very little expectations honestly and it has been solid since day one. Not one issue. The gentlemen that run our shipping dept. are all over 55 yrs old country folks who have little to no tech skills ingeneral and I was worried that this system would prove difficult to teach them how to operate. It was not. Indeed they've learned it well and have adapted nicely. If there is a hangup, thefts, or just odd behavior in general they've been able to revert back to the time frame and see for themselves. We've relied on it and it has delivered.The Shipping dept. is downstairs in a concrete, semi-well lit environment with 8 ft ceilings and this has had no problems with connecting to the cameras. The farthest reach is roughly 80 feet away. All wireless connected cameras. They're all indoors as well, so I have very little experience or information regarding the night vision capabilities.Initial setup was as simple as it could possibly be guys. I merely plugged in the DVR unit, a monitor and a supplied (albiet cheap) small little mouse and began to setup the basic settings (time zone, how I wanted it to record, motion vs. continuous, etc.). It is not on our network at all, so I have it set up as a locally controlled device only. I then plugged in the cameras one by one and they all connected fine. The IT Dept. is upstairs and I was even able to connect wirelessly through the floor. Trust me when I say that is a good test wirelessly. This building was built in 1892 and was built to withstand a nuclear war!! Literally ... there are 3 bomb shelters that were constructed in the 50's inside the facility. Should work nicely for your house. I assure you.I highly recommend it and am here now to purchase another for my house and one more for a friend of mine who has problems with thefts and is interested in this.Feel free to ask questions and I'll do my best to respond and assist as much as possible guys.","Received the 4 Camera System today. Amazon Prime is wonderful. I set up the entire System on a table in my office. I do recommend testing it before the cameras are installed in the final location. The instructions are written in very small print. I'm age 77, and small print is difficult for me. So, I enlarged all of the page with the aid of my Printer. I followed the directions on the first page. Luckily I had an Ethernet cable from my Router that was close enough to reach to the NVR. Also, my PC Monitor was easily connected to the NVR with the same cable from the PC. I plugged in the AC power for all four cameras. Then plugged in the AC power to the NVR. And just as the instructions stated, all four cameras displays appeared on the Monitor. They looked great. I was impressed. I continued follow the instructions in setting up my preferences with the use of the little mouse which came with the System. It was very easy to doNow, I just have to be concerned about the one camera which seems to be weaker and slower to connect.NOTICE: I will update this review, after I have installed the cameras. And hopefully that one camera will work better then.","Zosi is a great product and is very reliable. I would like to give one customer service personnel named Coco an outstanding rating. I had a problem adding a fifth camera which gave me tremendous problems. I contacted Customer service and Coco walked me through the process to get it working. Coco walked me through the process. She was very patient with me because and I am not a tech savvy person. After going through several processes, and sensing that I was frustrated, Coco tried one last attempt and decided that my DVR base needed to be replaced. at that point Coco had me to return the DVR base and shipped out a new one. Coco gets 10 stars from me as a Customer Service Representative, I am very impressed with her knowledge and ability to solve problems. Thank you Coco.","I bought the 4 camera version about 5 months ago. I wish now, I had went with the 8 camera version. And as you will read, their customer support is top notch which is one of the reasons I am now reviewing the unit... one of the camera I thought had failed but as their support was able to help with, in fact it did not and they easily helped get it back working again. I explain more a bit down this review.*NOTE for those wondering if you can hook the NVR wireless to your router, the answer is a yes and no. I had to place the NVR on the other end of the house from the router but did not want to run wiring... so I found a way to do it using wireless extenders which I will explain at the bottom of this review.Regardless, the quality of the camera's is outstanding especially at night. I have attached a video link of the camera catching a bear at dusk coming toward the house as the cameras switched into night vision mode.The reason I am writing the review now after 5 months however, is due to the customer support I got. One of the camera's suddenly failed... or so I thought. In reality, it turned out that I had to simply reset the addressing hardware ID code for that camera. It failed during a storm and my thought is a lightning strike may have just scrambled the brains a bit. BUT it was not until I contacted the company about a replacement camera that I learned the camera was probably fine.. They instructed me how to reset it and sure enough, it is back working perfectly. They were fast, courteous and knowledgeable. So I will definitely recommend this company and brand for those looking for a system.Finally, hooking this to your router. Sadly, the NVR does not allow you to directly do a wifi connection to your router. While the cameras all connect wireless to the NVR, the NVR itself has to be wired somehow to the router. In my case however, that would have meant running line the entire length of my house. Not something I wanted to do.So I thought about it a bit and then came up with a simple solution.. I bought one of those 'wireless extenders' you can simply plug into an outlet to extend wireless around your home. What many don't realize, is those extenders have BUILT IN network plugs! So while they are used to actually extend your wireless range, they can ALSO be used to plug in a WIRED DEVICE to give IT access to your router!So all I did was buy one of those, setup the extender to extend my wifi in my home, run a network cable from the NVR to the plug in the wifi extender and walla, my NVR is now connected to the router wirelessly because it is directly plugged into the extender via network cable.And it works perfectly.. In fact, I wanted to place one of my camera quite a distance from the house... but wireless range, especially for a video signal, is not very far. So what did I do? I bought a SECOND wireless extender, plugged that one into my workshop and then plugged camera 4 into the wireless extender via network cable and it now can be monitored through that connected wireless extender as well! Wireless extenders have a lot more power and range than the camera on its own. Probably double from my testing so this solution allowed me to place a camera where normally I would not be able to reach wirelessly on its own.As I started this review with, my only regret with this purchase... I should have bought the 8 camera version.. I really need it now as we moved into a larger home and a lot of land.. Wish the company would trade me up to the 8 camera from this 4 camera! ;-)","I've been using this Zosi camera system for a little over a year now here is my honest opinion of it.Pros:1) For the price the camera quality is fair during the day and at night the night-vision is even better2) Range on the wifi of the cameras isnt too good BUT if you have them wired no issues3) A few weeks ago one of the cameras stopped working after a bit of troubleshooting knew it was dead, I contacted Zosi support for assistance and after troubleshooting with them, they confirmed its dead and were kind enough to send me a replacementCons: 1) The motion detectors will pick anything and if you have email/alarm notifications it will go off every second well at least with my setup2) My hard-drive would get uncomfortably hot, simple fix for me was mounting 2x80mm fans.3) User interface is simple but could have done well with a few extra options and easier way to back up footage.overall its precisely what you pay for its functional for a mid-range camera system, would i recommend it, yes, and their support team gave me extra confident to their systems.

After doing some research I decided I didn’t want to use a cloud based service that would cost me a monthly operating fee. I then looked at the big box stores, but I elected to try the ZOSI DVR wired camera system. Best value and cost by far.I installed the system without any problems. One could just hook it up and it automatically starts recording, or you can use many other useful features. My mom probably could have just plugged it in to record without any reading... if you want other features, some degree of technical abilities is needed.Points to know:1. I created a gmail account just for this and set security on my gmail to low so that the ZOSI dvr was able to use the outgoing mail server without any issues. I could then make settings on the DVR to email me alerts when motion is detected.2. I didn’t use a PC to program, but rather the included mouse. It’s easy. One can then look at a frame and select where in the frame to look for motion and set the sensitivity. This is useful if a frame has trees blowing and cars going by, but you only want an alert if a gate opens.3. I downloaded the ZOSI app for my iPhone and I initially couldn’t get it to work. I emailed their tech support and they were fast and helpful. The manual is not well written and the tech support by email required me to think a bit differently. I sent screen shots and they texted back, “Please use zosi smart app on your phone, your DVR's network is okay, And the e-mail issue, the smtp server is smtp.gmail.com please refer to the below link” I was initially thinking... “don’t they see I did use the ZOSI app? But then I thought to look and there is more than one app... and there is one called, “ZOSI smart” I had ZOSI view. So get the right one! And I quickly said to myself... that’s how I set up the email... but I wrote “google” and not “gmail”. It was easy once I corrected my mistakes. Thank you ZOSI support.4. Lots of options for cameras and DVRs. I have a guest house and a front house. Small city lot, but still further than the 65’ of run for the camera cable. I ended up buying 2 different ZOSI systems. Both are great. The cost is great. The app registers the devices and I can monitor from my iPhone.5. In trying to solve some email issues before contacting their support, I read some posts on setting up port forwarding on your router. Don’t worry... it wasn’t needed. This isn’t as complicated as I was thinking!So in the end, I was able to install 2 systems with 6 cameras and my property is covered! All for much cheaper than a monthly fee based service.","Great system for the price. 1080p cameras and a 1TB DVR for under $200 is pretty good. I have all 4 cameras recording at max resolution and it stores about 30days worth of video before it over writes. Easy installation too.I haven’t been able to get the email alerts to work. The user interface for the iPhone app could use some work. It will freeze sometimes or lock up my 6S phone. Not too often though. I also have the DVR connected to a HD monitor. The user interface is pretty good, it just takes some time to learn how to use all the features.The cameras work well and the night vision is good. If you are covering a large area I would recommend an additional IR flood light for at night.Update..... After about 1 year I had an issue where the DVR would not boot up. I contacted a person named Slina at ZOSI tech support via email and I received a response within a few hours. I was asked to try several things which didn't fix it. I was then asked to send the broken unit back and I received a warranty replacement in about 4 days.I was very impressed with the quick response, level of customer support and the ease of getting a replacement under warranty. My system is now working again and I am a happy customer!","Good set of cameras for Home security. Gives secured 360 view of my home. 30 day recording is a plus. Went with hard wired because wireless camera reception isnt as clear as hard wired. This system also allows me to view my property on my iphone as long as its hooked to the wifi router. Dont let these wack reviews stop you. If you take time to learn this system it can be beneficial. This system helped me stop some kids from hanging out in my yard when we weren’t home. When i showed the video to their mother, she laid into them like Madea.","I like the camera quality, it is clear and very easy to see a close up view. The main reason I like the Zosi is the customer service. I am not very knowledgeable as far as setting up the features, but all I have to do is contact the support people and they are on it. The company has helped me with a replacement when it crashed and when I could not remember the password they sent me the instructions that were really easy to follow and I got into my system. I would recommend this system to anyone.",Very light compared to my previous DVR. Also it is very quiet. Using a mouse to navigate the menu makes it very easy to use. Also the menus are very self explanatory and intuitive. I was able to use my old cameras with the system (saved the cameras the system came with for future use or replacement). The only draw back to doing this is that I do not get sound nor can I speak through the camera for my old cameras did not have this capability but I know that if I install the cameras that came with the kit I would have this capability. The quality of the cameras are plastic and feel a bit cheap when compared to my older ones that are forged metal. The recorder works very well and you can even use your app on your phone to review recordings.,515,108,https://www.amazon.com/ZOSI-Security-Cameras-8-Channel-Recorder/dp/B083DQDWMS/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=zosi+security+camera&qid=1640229325&sr=8-14

They are great.,Nice picture quality,"I own 13 of these and have them around the property. Some are the older model, some are the C289. They all work with Blue Iris except for the PTZ function with the new C289. I talking to blue iris to find out the setting that allows it. It used to be camtonk 264 would work, but there was a software update recently that wiped that. Waiting to hear back from them. All other other zosi's I have work great with it.The new zosi app is really bad. The old one was meh, this one is terrible, and don't even think about using the window's app they have for it. Ahhh, freezes more than it works.Blue Iris is the way to go with these. I've been using Zosi's for a couple of years. I've had to replace some power supplies, but that's about it. Power supplies for these are 10 bucks, and my problem was not using enough RTV to seal them. Though I used a good amount. Not sure how water got it, but grrr... I just bought a bunch of back up pwr supplies to be safe...rofl :PWhat more do you want for a $45 dollar camera?","The video is clean and clear, the colors are true. Okay, just like other posts the night vision doesn't work and I thaught it was my DVR recorder because it doesn't support smart mode, but after buying two more and accidentally turned on the internal OS system within the camera with its joystick. I was able to turn on the IR sensor and the night vision now works with my DVR.The derections is bad ( Caused me several weeks with out night vision). It shows to push the joystick left, right, up, down for the type of DVR you are using. Mine is up for D1, but the camera is set for smart mode as default. But old DVR's don't have it. Good news is that you can just push down for like 5 to 10 seconds on the joystick for the built-in camera OS system and turn on night vision for non-smart DVR's.Because the quality of their camera, I will be buying their 4k DVR system to future proof it. Mine is a 720p at the moment.","These camera work great and are better then the 1080p cameras that came with my Defender 1080p security system.If you install the cameras it will initially look like crap since the default settings are not optimal for using the cameras out of the box. You have to go through and adjust all of the settings on the on screen display. Once you make the correct adjustments, these cameras out perform the cameras that came with my 1080p Defender system.Very please with my purchase.","Finally after buying the 4 camera DVR system that didn't have 2 way audio, 2 other Zosi wireless rechargeable pod cams with 2 Way intercoms that have terrible range, I love these. Great range, clarity, no need for the DVR just an SD card, the cameras can pan manually or set up to automatically pan across a path, zoom, and have a very clear 2 way intercom.","I didn't know what to expect when I ordered these, they were so inexpensive, but I kinda thought they might be poor quality. Truth is, the picture is better than the ones that came with my system. Well worth the price! My only critical comment is that the night vision infrared LEDs give a spotlight effect making the scene brightly lit in the middle and darkish around the edges.",833,105,https://www.amazon.com/ZOSI-Security-Surveillance-Detection-Waterproof/dp/B08MQ6BMFY/ref=sr_1_17_sspa?keywords=zosi+security+camera&qid=1640229325&sr=8-17-spons&psc=1&smid=A252W7I0ACJHS1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExNDBaT1AxS1VTSllIJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTQ2Mjg0OFZCTjBQRzlBSkhVJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxOTY1MzI0OUgxSjlWQThaWE8md2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl

You might not get DSLR quality video but you can make out figures okay. There is a joystick-control on the camera cable for setting the various parameters. Left-Right-Up-Down-Press in to Enter the OSD (On Screen Display). The Instruction Booklet indicates how long you must keep pressing(holding) the joystick. When you Press and Hold the Joystick ""In"", you will enter the OSD. You can then change all types of parameters. Parameters once changed will stay saved even when power is removed. You don't need to turn off power then turn on power to save the parameter(s). You will need a computer monitor or a television set with video inputs to see and use the OSD. The camera sun-shade should be even with the back of the camera as it will interfere with the captured image if the shade is too far forward. I liked this camera so much I purchased a second one.",Works with my security camera. Excellent camera. Pleased with night vision.Update: I experienced a failure on one of my six cameras. I contacted ZOSI and they worked with me via EMAIL providing me instructions on what tests to perform to isolate the problem. After performing these tests and reporting the findings back to ZOSI they determined the camera had failed and authorized replacement. I am quite pleased with their service and support.,Well I have 4 cameras total now. Started with two and now added. For the cameras they work great along with 8 ch dvr I purchased with the first two cameras. Set up is easy . This system works great for my needs not a high priced system and get same results. Anytime I need to I can look back on dvr recording. I would recommend,"I have a Defender 8ch DVR that came with 4 cameras. I have decided to add some more cameras but the Defender brand ones were $75.00 a pop. I decided to take a chance on the zosi, and I am sure glad I did. It has an amazing picture with great color and the night mode is great as well. The instructions are straight forward on how to set the mode to work with your particular DVR. I wish I could give this thing more than 5 stars. I will definitely be purchasing more of these.",this camera is nice really good night picture clear as day work better then the one that came with the system worth the money,593,70,https://www.amazon.com/ZOSI-1280TVL-Security-Weatherproof-Surveillance/dp/B01DF6LJZK/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=zosi+security+camera&qid=1640229325&sr=8-13
